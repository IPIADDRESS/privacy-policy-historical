For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.items.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.items.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.items.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"6OliG0vWesickU800Mwio6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:46:06.589Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:45:29.287Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","paths":["/legal/terms-and-cancellation-policy","/terms-cancellation-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"5MYOpz4xvGa2gMwA0gQw2M","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T15:55:15.156Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:46.079Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"BL and RS: Terms & Cancellation Policy","title":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Below you will find details on a broad spectrum of important topics including payments, bookings, e-tickets, transfers, and cancellations.","sections":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"2G1Dep9zTGAQo6YCgOQssg","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T15:55:00.191Z","updatedAt":"2018-07-02T11:57:35.456Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"markdownTextArea"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"> These are the General Terms of Service and Cancellation Policy of Blue Lagoon hf., registered at Svartsengi, 240 Grindavík, Iceland.\n> These terms and policies apply to all guests visiting the Blue Lagoon and the Retreat Spa purchasing their services/products at www.bluelagoon.com, hereafter called website.\n\n\n\n## 1.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.items.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.items.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.items.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]"]}}]}}}}]}}]}}}}]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”).

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.items.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.items.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.items.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.1]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.items.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]"]}}]}}}},"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.items.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]"]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.items.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.items.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.items.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]"]}}]}}}},"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.items.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]"]}}]}}}}]}}]}}}}]}}]}}}}],"includes":{"Entry":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"DVKBZHBly8qMQc8w6Okug","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:45:15.437Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:12.257Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Privacy Policy","paths":["/legal/privacy-policy","/privacy-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"yX0kq5bcIK8Uy68uuesei","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-04T14:55:35.554Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:00.062Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Blue Lagoon Iceland: Privacy Policy","title":"Privacy Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Thank you for visiting our website.

Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"6OliG0vWesickU800Mwio6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:46:06.589Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:45:29.287Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","paths":["/legal/terms-and-cancellation-policy","/terms-cancellation-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"5MYOpz4xvGa2gMwA0gQw2M","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T15:55:15.156Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:46.079Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"BL and RS: Terms & Cancellation Policy","title":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Below you will find details on a broad spectrum of important topics including payments, bookings, e-tickets, transfers, and cancellations.","sections":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"2G1Dep9zTGAQo6YCgOQssg","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T15:55:00.191Z","updatedAt":"2018-07-02T11:57:35.456Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"markdownTextArea"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"> These are the General Terms of Service and Cancellation Policy of Blue Lagoon hf., registered at Svartsengi, 240 Grindavík, Iceland.\n> These terms and policies apply to all guests visiting the Blue Lagoon and the Retreat Spa purchasing their services/products at www.bluelagoon.com, hereafter called website.\n\n\n\n## 1.

These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]"]}}]}}}},"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]"]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4KMrwaqyF2gU28GeOqQkgE","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T10:36:57.313Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-16T16:09:49.670Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","paths":["/legal/cookie-statement"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"5nMRBGmRpuEGoKqMy40Ayo","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:48:31.077Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:57:17.957Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","title":"Cookie Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Cookies allow us to enhance your experience on our website.

For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.1.fields.relatedItems.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.1.fields.relatedItems.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.1.fields.relatedItems.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"6OliG0vWesickU800Mwio6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:46:06.589Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:45:29.287Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","paths":["/legal/terms-and-cancellation-policy","/terms-cancellation-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"5MYOpz4xvGa2gMwA0gQw2M","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T15:55:15.156Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:46.079Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"BL and RS: Terms & Cancellation Policy","title":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Below you will find details on a broad spectrum of important topics including payments, bookings, e-tickets, transfers, and cancellations.","sections":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.1]"]}}}}]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"6OliG0vWesickU800Mwio6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:46:06.589Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:45:29.287Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","paths":["/legal/terms-and-cancellation-policy","/terms-cancellation-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"5MYOpz4xvGa2gMwA0gQw2M","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T15:55:15.156Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:46.079Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"BL and RS: Terms & Cancellation Policy","title":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Below you will find details on a broad spectrum of important topics including payments, bookings, e-tickets, transfers, and cancellations.","sections":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.1]"]}}}}]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th,

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.1.fields.relatedItems.1.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.1.fields.relatedItems.1]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"6OliG0vWesickU800Mwio6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:46:06.589Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:45:29.287Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","paths":["/legal/terms-and-cancellation-policy","/terms-cancellation-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"5MYOpz4xvGa2gMwA0gQw2M","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T15:55:15.156Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:46.079Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"BL and RS: Terms & Cancellation Policy","title":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Below you will find details on a broad spectrum of important topics including payments, bookings, e-tickets, transfers, and cancellations.","sections":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.1]"]}}}}]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"6OliG0vWesickU800Mwio6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:46:06.589Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:45:29.287Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","paths":["/legal/terms-and-cancellation-policy","/terms-cancellation-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"5MYOpz4xvGa2gMwA0gQw2M","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T15:55:15.156Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:46.079Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"BL and RS: Terms & Cancellation Policy","title":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Below you will find details on a broad spectrum of important topics including payments, bookings, e-tickets, transfers, and cancellations.","sections":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.1]"]}}}}]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"DVKBZHBly8qMQc8w6Okug","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:45:15.437Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:12.257Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Privacy Policy","paths":["/legal/privacy-policy","/privacy-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"yX0kq5bcIK8Uy68uuesei","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-04T14:55:35.554Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:00.062Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Blue Lagoon Iceland: Privacy Policy","title":"Privacy Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Thank you for visiting our website.

Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”).

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"DVKBZHBly8qMQc8w6Okug","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:45:15.437Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:12.257Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Privacy Policy","paths":["/legal/privacy-policy","/privacy-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"yX0kq5bcIK8Uy68uuesei","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-04T14:55:35.554Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:00.062Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Blue Lagoon Iceland: Privacy Policy","title":"Privacy Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Thank you for visiting our website.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"DVKBZHBly8qMQc8w6Okug","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:45:15.437Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:12.257Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Privacy Policy","paths":["/legal/privacy-policy","/privacy-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"yX0kq5bcIK8Uy68uuesei","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-04T14:55:35.554Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:00.062Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Blue Lagoon Iceland: Privacy Policy","title":"Privacy Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Thank you for visiting our website.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"DVKBZHBly8qMQc8w6Okug","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:45:15.437Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:12.257Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Privacy Policy","paths":["/legal/privacy-policy","/privacy-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"yX0kq5bcIK8Uy68uuesei","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-04T14:55:35.554Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:00.062Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Blue Lagoon Iceland: Privacy Policy","title":"Privacy Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Thank you for visiting our website.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"DVKBZHBly8qMQc8w6Okug","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:45:15.437Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:12.257Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Privacy Policy","paths":["/legal/privacy-policy","/privacy-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"yX0kq5bcIK8Uy68uuesei","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-04T14:55:35.554Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:00.062Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Blue Lagoon Iceland: Privacy Policy","title":"Privacy Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Thank you for visiting our website.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"DVKBZHBly8qMQc8w6Okug","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:45:15.437Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:12.257Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Privacy Policy","paths":["/legal/privacy-policy","/privacy-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"yX0kq5bcIK8Uy68uuesei","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-04T14:55:35.554Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:00.062Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Blue Lagoon Iceland: Privacy Policy","title":"Privacy Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Thank you for visiting our website.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"DVKBZHBly8qMQc8w6Okug","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:45:15.437Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:12.257Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Privacy Policy","paths":["/legal/privacy-policy","/privacy-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"yX0kq5bcIK8Uy68uuesei","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-04T14:55:35.554Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:00.062Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Blue Lagoon Iceland: Privacy Policy","title":"Privacy Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Thank you for visiting our website.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"DVKBZHBly8qMQc8w6Okug","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:45:15.437Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:12.257Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Privacy Policy","paths":["/legal/privacy-policy","/privacy-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"yX0kq5bcIK8Uy68uuesei","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-04T14:55:35.554Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:00.062Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Blue Lagoon Iceland: Privacy Policy","title":"Privacy Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Thank you for visiting our website.

Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon.

The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.3.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.3]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.3.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]"]}}]}}}},"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.3.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]"]}}]}}}},"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.3]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.4.fields.relatedItems.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4KMrwaqyF2gU28GeOqQkgE","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T10:36:57.313Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-16T16:09:49.670Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","paths":["/legal/cookie-statement"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"5nMRBGmRpuEGoKqMy40Ayo","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:48:31.077Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:57:17.957Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","title":"Cookie Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Cookies allow us to enhance your experience on our website.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.4.fields.relatedItems.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4KMrwaqyF2gU28GeOqQkgE","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T10:36:57.313Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-16T16:09:49.670Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","paths":["/legal/cookie-statement"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"5nMRBGmRpuEGoKqMy40Ayo","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:48:31.077Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:57:17.957Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","title":"Cookie Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Cookies allow us to enhance your experience on our website.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.4.fields.relatedItems.2.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4KMrwaqyF2gU28GeOqQkgE","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T10:36:57.313Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-16T16:09:49.670Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","paths":["/legal/cookie-statement"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"5nMRBGmRpuEGoKqMy40Ayo","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:48:31.077Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:57:17.957Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","title":"Cookie Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Cookies allow us to enhance your experience on our website.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"DVKBZHBly8qMQc8w6Okug","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:45:15.437Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:12.257Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Privacy Policy","paths":["/legal/privacy-policy","/privacy-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"yX0kq5bcIK8Uy68uuesei","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-04T14:55:35.554Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:00.062Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Blue Lagoon Iceland: Privacy Policy","title":"Privacy Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Thank you for visiting our website.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.5.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.5]"}},"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.5.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]"]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.5]"}},"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.5.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]"]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4KMrwaqyF2gU28GeOqQkgE","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T10:36:57.313Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-16T16:09:49.670Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","paths":["/legal/cookie-statement"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"5nMRBGmRpuEGoKqMy40Ayo","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:48:31.077Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:57:17.957Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","title":"Cookie Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Cookies allow us to enhance your experience on our website.

For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.6.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.6.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.6.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"6OliG0vWesickU800Mwio6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:46:06.589Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:45:29.287Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","paths":["/legal/terms-and-cancellation-policy","/terms-cancellation-policy"],"content":"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.6]"}}]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"6OliG0vWesickU800Mwio6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:46:06.589Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:45:29.287Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","paths":["/legal/terms-and-cancellation-policy","/terms-cancellation-policy"],"content":"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.6]"}}]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.6.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.6.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.1]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"6OliG0vWesickU800Mwio6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:46:06.589Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:45:29.287Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","paths":["/legal/terms-and-cancellation-policy","/terms-cancellation-policy"],"content":"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.6]"}}]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"6OliG0vWesickU800Mwio6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:46:06.589Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:45:29.287Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","paths":["/legal/terms-and-cancellation-policy","/terms-cancellation-policy"],"content":"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.6]"}}]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"6OliG0vWesickU800Mwio6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:46:06.589Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:45:29.287Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","paths":["/legal/terms-and-cancellation-policy","/terms-cancellation-policy"],"content":"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.6]"}}]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4KMrwaqyF2gU28GeOqQkgE","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T10:36:57.313Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-16T16:09:49.670Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","paths":["/legal/cookie-statement"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"5nMRBGmRpuEGoKqMy40Ayo","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:48:31.077Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:57:17.957Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","title":"Cookie Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Cookies allow us to enhance your experience on our website.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.6.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.1.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.6.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.1]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"6OliG0vWesickU800Mwio6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:46:06.589Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:45:29.287Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","paths":["/legal/terms-and-cancellation-policy","/terms-cancellation-policy"],"content":"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.6]"}}]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"6OliG0vWesickU800Mwio6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:46:06.589Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:45:29.287Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","paths":["/legal/terms-and-cancellation-policy","/terms-cancellation-policy"],"content":"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.6]"}}]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"DVKBZHBly8qMQc8w6Okug","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:45:15.437Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:12.257Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Privacy Policy","paths":["/legal/privacy-policy","/privacy-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"yX0kq5bcIK8Uy68uuesei","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-04T14:55:35.554Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:00.062Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Blue Lagoon Iceland: Privacy Policy","title":"Privacy Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Thank you for visiting our website.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.

For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.7.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4KMrwaqyF2gU28GeOqQkgE","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T10:36:57.313Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-16T16:09:49.670Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","paths":["/legal/cookie-statement"],"content":"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.7]"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"6OliG0vWesickU800Mwio6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:46:06.589Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:45:29.287Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","paths":["/legal/terms-and-cancellation-policy","/terms-cancellation-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"5MYOpz4xvGa2gMwA0gQw2M","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T15:55:15.156Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:46.079Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"BL and RS: Terms & Cancellation Policy","title":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Below you will find details on a broad spectrum of important topics including payments, bookings, e-tickets, transfers, and cancellations.","sections":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"2G1Dep9zTGAQo6YCgOQssg","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T15:55:00.191Z","updatedAt":"2018-07-02T11:57:35.456Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"markdownTextArea"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"> These are the General Terms of Service and Cancellation Policy of Blue Lagoon hf., registered at Svartsengi, 240 Grindavík, Iceland.\n> These terms and policies apply to all guests visiting the Blue Lagoon and the Retreat Spa purchasing their services/products at www.bluelagoon.com, hereafter called website.\n\n\n\n## 1.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.7.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4KMrwaqyF2gU28GeOqQkgE","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T10:36:57.313Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-16T16:09:49.670Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","paths":["/legal/cookie-statement"],"content":"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.7]"}},"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.7.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]"]}}]}}}}]}}]}}}}]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.8.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.8.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.8.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.8]"]}}]}}}},"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.8]"]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.8.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.8.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.8]"]}}]}}}},"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.8.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.8]"]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4KMrwaqyF2gU28GeOqQkgE","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T10:36:57.313Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-16T16:09:49.670Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","paths":["/legal/cookie-statement"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"5nMRBGmRpuEGoKqMy40Ayo","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:48:31.077Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:57:17.957Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","title":"Cookie Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Cookies allow us to enhance your experience on our website.

While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"DVKBZHBly8qMQc8w6Okug","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:45:15.437Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:12.257Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Privacy Policy","paths":["/legal/privacy-policy","/privacy-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"yX0kq5bcIK8Uy68uuesei","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-04T14:55:35.554Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:00.062Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Blue Lagoon Iceland: Privacy Policy","title":"Privacy Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Thank you for visiting our website.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.9.fields.relatedItems.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.9.fields.relatedItems.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":["[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.9.fields.relatedItems.2.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.0]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"DVKBZHBly8qMQc8w6Okug","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:45:15.437Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:12.257Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Privacy Policy","paths":["/legal/privacy-policy","/privacy-policy"],"content":"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.10]"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4KMrwaqyF2gU28GeOqQkgE","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T10:36:57.313Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-16T16:09:49.670Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","paths":["/legal/cookie-statement"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"5nMRBGmRpuEGoKqMy40Ayo","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:48:31.077Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:57:17.957Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Cookie Policy","title":"Cookie Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Cookies allow us to enhance your experience on our website.

For more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).\n\n## What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"DVKBZHBly8qMQc8w6Okug","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:45:15.437Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:12.257Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Privacy Policy","paths":["/legal/privacy-policy","/privacy-policy"],"content":"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.10]"}},"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.10.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.1]",{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"6OliG0vWesickU800Mwio6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:46:06.589Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:45:29.287Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","paths":["/legal/terms-and-cancellation-policy","/terms-cancellation-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"5MYOpz4xvGa2gMwA0gQw2M","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T15:55:15.156Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:46.079Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"BL and RS: Terms & Cancellation Policy","title":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Below you will find details on a broad spectrum of important topics including payments, bookings, e-tickets, transfers, and cancellations.","sections":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"2G1Dep9zTGAQo6YCgOQssg","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T15:55:00.191Z","updatedAt":"2018-07-02T11:57:35.456Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"markdownTextArea"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"> These are the General Terms of Service and Cancellation Policy of Blue Lagoon hf., registered at Svartsengi, 240 Grindavík, Iceland.\n> These terms and policies apply to all guests visiting the Blue Lagoon and the Retreat Spa purchasing their services/products at www.bluelagoon.com, hereafter called website.\n\n\n\n## 1.

Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For further information, see the section of the Cookie Statement entitled \"Targeted online advertising\".\n<br>\n\nBelow you can see which specific cookies we use and how you can find resources to opt out.<br><br>\n\n| Provider     | Category    | Cookie name    | Opt out     |\n| ----------   | ---------- | ---------- |---------- | \n| Borgun        | Essential  | TS#       | - |\n| Cloudflare    | Essential  | _cfuid       | - |\n| Facebook Pixel| Advertising |     fbq*     | [Opt out](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217 \"Facebook Pixel Opt-out\") |\n| Firebase      | Essential  | -       | - |\n| FullStory     | Performance  | fs_uid      | - |\n| Google Analytics      | Performance  | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ \"Google Analytics opt out\") |\n| Google DoubleClick   | Advertising  | IDE       | [Opt out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en \"Google Double Click Opt out\") |\n| Google AdWords       | Performance | _gs, _gat, _gid       | [Opt out](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-GB \"Google Adwords opt out\") |\n| Loggly    | Essential  | logglytrackingsession     | - |\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n## Other tracking technologies\nWe and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track.\n\n## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.\n\nThe date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.\n\n## Where can I get further information?\nIf you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@bluelagoon.com.\n\nUpdated: May 18th, 2018","relatedItems":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"DVKBZHBly8qMQc8w6Okug","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:45:15.437Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:12.257Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Privacy Policy","paths":["/legal/privacy-policy","/privacy-policy"],"content":"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.10]"}},"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.10.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.1]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.10.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.1.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]"]}}]}}}},"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.10.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.1]"]}}]}}}}]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"6OliG0vWesickU800Mwio6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:46:06.589Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:45:29.287Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","paths":["/legal/terms-and-cancellation-policy","/terms-cancellation-policy"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"5MYOpz4xvGa2gMwA0gQw2M","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T15:55:15.156Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:59:46.079Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"BL and RS: Terms & Cancellation Policy","title":"Terms & Cancellation Policy","multilineSubtitle":"Below you will find details on a broad spectrum of important topics including payments, bookings, e-tickets, transfers, and cancellations.","sections":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"2G1Dep9zTGAQo6YCgOQssg","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T15:55:00.191Z","updatedAt":"2018-07-02T11:57:35.456Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"markdownTextArea"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"> These are the General Terms of Service and Cancellation Policy of Blue Lagoon hf., registered at Svartsengi, 240 Grindavík, Iceland.\n> These terms and policies apply to all guests visiting the Blue Lagoon and the Retreat Spa purchasing their services/products at www.bluelagoon.com, hereafter called website.\n\n\n\n## 1.

You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading \"How can I control cookies?\" in the Cookie Statement.\n<br>\n\n__Performance Cookies__\nThese cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.\n<br>\n\n__Advertising (Targeting) Cookies__\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.

These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.\n\n__Targeted online advertising__\nWe have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyse both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve advertising on other sites.\n\nThese third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, visit [About Ads](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nOur third party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).\n\n\n\n## How can I control cookies?\n\nYou have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\n\n__Website Cookie Preference Tool:__ \nYou can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available here: Privacy Settings. You can also exercise your Website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.\n\n__Browser Controls:__ \nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.\n\n__Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:__\nMost advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\n\n__Do Not Track:__ \nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Blue Lagoon Iceland takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.

To ensure your safety and to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we ask you to pay special attention to the following:\n\n## SAFETY STANDARDS\n### Minimum age for using the lagoon is 2 years old.\n\nAll children 2-15 years of age must be accompanied by an adult guardian during their visit. A maximum of two children may be accompanied by one guardian unless the guardian is their parent. The lagoon is 90-160 cm deep. Due to its high mineral content, the lagoon water is cloudy and not transparent. Guardians should therefore show special caution when supervising children.\n\n### Children 2-8 years of age must wear inflatable armbands. \nThis is to increase their visibility in the lagoon. Inflatable armbands are readily available – free of charge – at the lagoon. Note: The floaties are not considered a life saving device and therefore do not replace continuous adult supervision of children.\n\n### Those unable to swim must notify staff.\nStaff will inform the guest of the lagoon’s depth and recommend preventative measures.\n\n### Excessive intoxication is prohibited.\nEach adult guest may only buy 3 alcoholic beverages while in the lagoon. For safety reasons, we reserve the right to refuse/withdraw access to anyone who arrives intoxicated or wants to enter/remain in the lagoon intoxicated. The determination of whether an individual is intoxicated is solely at our discretion. In such cases, the guest is not entitled to a refund.\n\n### Wash without swimsuit before entering the lagoon.\nThe cleanliness of the lagoon is partly dependent upon the cleanliness of our guests. The shower gel available in each shower was specially designed by our skin care department to prepare your skin for the lagoon.\n\n### No smoking.\nSmoking is strictly prohibited in and around the lagoon. This also applies to electric cigarettes. Smoking area is by the parking lot.\n\n### No diving.\nThe Lagoon is too shallow for diving.\n\n### Always comply with Blue Lagoons staff’s instructions.\nLack of compliance with Blue Lagoon staff instructions – or inappropriate behavior toward other guests – can result in immediate expulsion from Blue Lagoon.\n\n### Inform about medical conditions.\nInform staff about any medical conditions that might affect your safety in the lagoon. For example seizures, heart conditions etc. Reception manager will provide a special wristband and inform lifeguards.\n\n### Stay hydrated – drink water. \nWater fountains are located in locker rooms and around the Lagoon.\n\n### Avoid dehydration. \nTake regular breaks to cool down. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fainting.\n\n### Mind your step – hold handrails.\nPlease be aware that floors and walkways may be slippery and/or wet. Exercise caution when walking in wet areas and on stairs. Do not run. Hold on to handrails where available.\n\n### Keep dry areas dry. \nTake your towel with you when going to the shower room. Dry yourself before re-entering the changing rooms in order to prevent wet and slippery surfaces.\n\n### Keep noise to a minimum. \nWe kindly ask our guests to respect the rights of others to relax and enjoy the calm atmosphere in the lagoon.\n\n### Securely lock valuables in your locker.\nBlue Lagoon is not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. In cases of theft, please contact the spa manager.\n\n### Walk on designated walking paths. \nRespect Blue Lagoon’s unique nature and do not step into the lava fields or on the moss.\n\n### Sort your waste. \nPlease sort your waste and place it into proper recycling bins.","relatedItems":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"DVKBZHBly8qMQc8w6Okug","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:45:15.437Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:12.257Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Privacy Policy","paths":["/legal/privacy-policy","/privacy-policy"],"content":"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.10]"}},"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.10.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2.fields.content.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.1]","[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.10.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]"]}}]}}}},"[Circular ~.jobs.1.data.includes.Entry.10.fields.sections.0.fields.relatedItems.2]"]}}]}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"1pUYDoePeA8ymi2g0cqIwY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-21T14:47:16.445Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-24T09:46:54.898Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety standards","paths":["/legal/safety-standards","/safety-standards"],"content":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ms00sm67qvmi"}},"id":"4rlf42k8aseqKyeqmMK8sq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-17T17:01:28.082Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-23T15:58:05.659Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":11,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Safety Standards","title":"Safety Standards","multilineSubtitle":"Your safety is our highest priority.

Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n\nCookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Blue Lagoon Iceland) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.\n\n## Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?\nWe use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n\n## Cookies served through our Websites\nThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:\n\n__Essential Website Cookies__\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.
