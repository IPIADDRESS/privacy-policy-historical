<b>Blue Track Media, LLC, Privacy Policy</b><br>
<br>
Last updated July 10, 2009.<br>
<br>
Blue Track Media outlines important information in this Privacy Policy regarding the use and disclosure of information collected via www.bluetrackmedia.com.<br>
Blue Track Media provides this Privacy Policy to help users make an informed decision as to whether to use or continue using this website. Blue Track Media is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy applies to Blue Track Media's collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by Blue Track Media on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the Website), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to Blue Track Media's other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties.<br>
<br>
Note: Blue Track Media has the right to change this privacy policy at anytime. It is up to the reader to come back and see the changes as they will only be updated on here and no where else. If you do not agree to this privacy policy, please contact us to terminate your account immediately.<br>
<br>
<b>Information collected from Third Parties.</b><br>
Blue Track Media collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and Blue Track Media subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the Seller).

When acquiring Third Party List Information, Blue Track Media seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to Blue Track Media and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.<br>
<br>
<b>Information collected from Surveys.</b><br>
Blue Track Media collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an Blue Track Media survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a Survey). (As used herein, online means using the Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and offline means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Blue Track Media or a third party (a Third Party) may ask an individual to provide various information to Blue Track Media, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, Survey Information). Blue Track Media may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and use that information in combination with information provided from this Web Site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Blue Track Media or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Blue Track Media or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Blue Track Media.<br>

(c) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Blue Track Media service or newsletter (together, Other Information).<br>
