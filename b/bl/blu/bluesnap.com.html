<p><strong>BlueSnap Privacy Policy v.2.0 Date: 25th May 2018</strong></p>
<p><strong>BlueSnap Respects Your Privacy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
This website and related services are owned and operated by BlueSnap, Inc. (“BlueSnap”) a global company providing&nbsp;<a href="http://home.bluesnap.com/payment-gateway/">payment gateway</a>&nbsp;services and enabling eCommerce, marketing and payment processing, together with various subsidiaries including a European Union subsidiary BlueSnap Payment Services Limited, Canadian subsidiary BlueSnap Enterprise Canada ULC and Australian subsidiary BlueSnap Australia Pty Limited. References to BlueSnap in this policy also include these subsidiaries unless otherwise stated. Additional subsidiaries may be added over time and shall be governed by the terms of this policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that you care about how your information is used and shared when you enter it on our websites,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bluesnap.com/">www.bluesnap.com</a>, or use BlueSnap’s payment services as a merchant or shopper, and this notice describes our privacy policy and practices.</p>
<p>BlueSnap respects each individual’s right to personal privacy. We will collect and use information through our website including registration forms, inquiry forms, product transaction forms, mobile and API services only in the ways disclosed in this statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Online payment transactions involve transfer of data across international borders, as well backing up of data at our secured data centers in the EU and USA. This means that data may be transferred, processed and stored outside the EU, the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland. By submitting your data directly or through a third party such as a merchant you are agreeing to such transfer, processing and storage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BlueSnap is committed to maintaining the principles of transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. BlueSnap Inc., is certified with the&nbsp;<strong>EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework</strong>&nbsp;full details of which appear in the dedicated section below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When using BlueSnap’s services, technologies, functions, web site or applications, the terms of this policy will apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BlueSnap Services and You</strong></p>
<p>BlueSnap acts as a technology provider supplying secure online and mobile digital payment processing services to businesses known as&nbsp;<em>merchants</em>&nbsp;so that they can sell their goods and services to their shoppers both domestically and worldwide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The personal information collected by BlueSnap depends on how you are using our services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Individuals typically interface with BlueSnap in one of the following ways:</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Site Visitor</em></strong><em>: If you are visiting our website for details about our products and services, you may be asked to enter your personal details on an online form to receive more information. Cookies may be used to track site usage to assist in product development or monitor behavior for marketing purposes. Visitors from the EU/EEA may initially be asked to expressly consent to cookie usage.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Merchant:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;you may be a business customer that has consented to BlueSnap’s terms of service under a merchant or other formal agreement and use BlueSnap to conduct secure online sales. To set up a merchant account you will need to provide personal details, business data and identifying documentation.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Shopper:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;You may be a business or consumer using BlueSnap’s secure online payment technologies to complete the purchase of goods and services from a merchant that has selected BlueSnap as its payments solution. Your own choice of payment method will usually determine what personal data is passed to BlueSnap to enable your payment transaction to take place. It could be name, address and credit/debit card details, electronic bank transfer information, or pay-wallet credentials if using a service such as PayPal.</em></p>
<p><em>While such secure transactions may be completed in just a few seconds they are often complicated by the fact that live anti-fraud checks need to be conducted. Data also has to be passed to the relevant payment processors; banks, payment card and payment account services may need to be notified; legal tax invoices generated, and transaction confirmations delivered. Some or all of these steps may all involve the transfer and sharing of personal data down a chain of service providers, as well as the use of tracking cookies.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Information BlueSnap Collects</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The types of personal information we may obtain or you may choose to provide include:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of this information may be collected automatically by using technologies such as cookies and web beacons, when you interact with advertisements, mobile applications, sales pages, website pages and other digital applications. Often shoppers will provide information themselves when interacting with merchants to purchase goods and services.</p>

<li>Communicate with you, respond to inquiries and send service notices, issue notices about functions and services you are registered to use including significant developments about the website and/or eCommerce services. (Users cannot normally op-out of this kind of email communication without cancelling the relevant service).</li>
<li>When BlueSnap acts as payment service provider, merchant and/or reseller for product suppliers, we may need to share relevant customer information with the specific merchant/product supplier involved in the transaction in order for them to fulfill the transaction. Such information is supplied on the condition that it will not be used for spamming or direct marketing by another party. Occasionally such product suppliers may sell, transfer or assign their business to new owners and in such circumstances data records may be accessible to the new owners subject to such parties satisfying the underwriting requirements of BlueSnap and assuming the ongoing responsibility for the proper protection of such data by committing to relevant contractual provisions</li>
<li>Check applications for use of BlueSnap services, perform account underwriting and KYC reviews, protect against and prevent customer and transaction fraud, unauthorized transactions, claims, manage risk exposure, conduct periodic risk reviews and credit checks</li>
<li>Evaluate business, product development, improve services, perform marketing activities, run billing, invoicing and account reconciliation functions</li>
<li>Compliance with legislation, regulations, legal requirements and law enforcement measures, orders and subpoenas from judicial and governmental authorities, enforcement and defense of contractual and legal rights and claims, generation of reserves, guarantees and sureties</li>
<li>Perform data analysis and generation of aggregated data reports based on anonymized information for benefit of BlueSnap, Merchants, processing partners, regulators and customers, auditing practices, conducting business intelligence, performance reporting</li>
<li>Compliance with internal policies, card industry and payment scheme requirements, Payment Card Industry (PCI) assessment and validation</li>
<li>Provide you with content, data and advertising tailored to your individual interests, enabling you to access BlueSnap services such as the Merchant or Shopper Control panel, support, chargeback management services</li>

<p>BlueSnap’s services enable merchants to sell to shoppers across the world. This sometimes requires BlueSnap to provide services through specific legal entities. BlueSnap Inc., is based in the USA, and its affiliate BlueSnap Payment Services Ltd., is a regulated UK payments institution offering payment services across the EU/EEA. BlueSnap Enterprise Canada ULC offers payment services to Canadian merchants. BlueSnap Australia Pty Limited&nbsp;offers payment services to Australian merchants. Additional BlueSnap entities may be added and shall automatically be covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How and Where Information is Stored</strong></p>
<p>BlueSnap maintains administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information provided or collected against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or misuse. Data is also routinely backed up at secure locations in Europe and the US in accordance with standard industry practice. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any further questions about privacy or security, or have reason to believe your data security has been compromised please contact us immediately by sending an email to:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Security@bluesnap.com">Security@bluesnap.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The international nature of BlueSnap’s services means that personal data may be transferred beyond your national borders when you use BlueSnap’s services or purchase from or sell to persons or entities outside your country. By using such services you are deemed to understand and accept that data may be subject to cross-border transfers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How long data is retained</strong></p>
<p>BlueSnap stores personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the personal information was collected and as required or authorized by law. We take measures to delete or permanently de-identify personal information as required by law or if no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. Certain data relating to transaction records particularly billing and invoice information may be required to be safeguarded for significant periods of time in accordance with standard tax and accounting practices, or to enable the refund and chargeback requests to be processed on behalf of shoppers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sharing of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>BlueSnap does not sell or otherwise disclose personal information we collect about you except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy or as may be disclosed to you at the time information is collected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BlueSnap may share personal information collected with its subsidiaries and other BlueSnap entities that process payment transactions as well as relevant merchants, fraud prevention services, card and payment services, and payment processors/acquirers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BlueSnap may share certain information with service providers who provide or perform services on behalf of BlueSnap. We authorize such services providers to use or disclose such information only as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. Such entities are required by contract to safeguard the privacy and security of personal information processed on our behalf. We may also share personal information with other parties with your&nbsp;<strong>express&nbsp;</strong>consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal data used with respect to payment transactions involving individuals of the EU/EEA often needs to be passed to other parties as part of the transaction process. Transfers of data may be through APIs, email, and other formats, and may be bi-directional. BlueSnap takes steps to ensure that such parties are committed to compliance with applicable data law including the GDPR and that any additional Data Processors or Sub-Processors used are retained under a contractual duty of compliance and are able to respond to data subject access requests. In certain situations, BlueSnap and its subsidiaries might be deemed to be acting on the instruction of other transaction services or together with such parties, in which case BlueSnap shall itself be obligated to act in a manner compliant with applicable data law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain Merchants might use checkout and other systems as part of the payment transaction process that might be integrated with BlueSnap. Accordingly personal information that you provide to such services either directly or through your selected Merchant might be passed to BlueSnap.&nbsp; BlueSnap treats such personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, however other entities might have their own policies and these should be thoroughly checked by you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BlueSnap may use third-party service providers, for example to provide you with support when using our site and including the use of live chat software. When you sign up for our services we will share your personal information only as necessary for the third party to provide that service.&nbsp;Personal information collected relating to marketing and Merchant underwriting functions may be stored and processed on secure compliant cloud-based services provided by third parties to BlueSnap. Such service providers are contractually required by BlueSnap to act in compliance with relevant data law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Merger, sale and/or transfer of corporate assets or reorganization</strong></p>
<p>BlueSnap may transfer information as part of any corporate merger, sale, acquisition, transfer or assets or reorganization without notice. Such transfer will be on the basis of the continuation of all privacy rights set out in this document. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in BlueSnap ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Compliance with court orders &amp; law enforcement agencies</strong></p>
<p>BlueSnap may be required to disclose personal information without notification in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security requirements, or in order to comply with a legal requirement, legislation, regulation, court order or subpoena, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, prevent harm of financial loss, protect your safety or the safety of others or investigate fraud or cooperate with law enforcement or government agencies, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>EU/EEA Data Privacy Law</strong></p>

As BlueSnap is acting as payment service provider, merchant and/or reseller for product suppliers we need to share relevant customer information with the specific product supplier involved in the transaction in order for them to fulfill the transaction. Such information, if provided to product suppliers, is supplied on the condition that it should not be used for spamming or direct marketing by another party. Occasionally such product suppliers may sell, transfer or assign their business to new owners and in such circumstances data records may be accessible to the new owners subject to such parties satisfying the requirements of BlueSnap and assuming the ongoing responsibility for the proper protection of such data.</li>
<li>Out of respect for the privacy of our Customers we present the option to opt out of any mailing lists operated by BlueSnap or relevant product suppliers as set out in the Opt Out section of this policy.</li>
<li>Where customer data is passed to a relevant product supplier the use of such information may be subject to the privacy policy of such product supplier and their standards may differ from those of BlueSnap.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Payment data</strong></p>
<p>Personal payment information such as credit card numbers, bank account information, name, email address and phone number is routinely collected and passed on to authorized payment processors, banks, acquirers, and credit card companies in order to make payments sanctioned by BlueSnap customers. Such information is handled through industry standard secure protocols and where appropriate in accordance with relevant Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance standards. Such information may also be passed when making payment via BlueSnap through mobile devices.</p>
<p>Such data may also be encrypted and securely stored by BlueSnap and appropriate merchants and product suppliers in accordance with PCI standards. When expressly directed and approved by a customer it may be used to generate recurring or new transactions as requested by such customer. Transaction details may also be passed to relevant taxation authorities in respect of sales taxes, VAT, withholding tax, and other relevant taxes and duties.</p>
<p>Certain data may be subject to analysis and checking by third-party fraud prevention services in accordance with payment industry practice.</p>
<p><strong>Service providers</strong></p>

<p><strong>Affiliate tracking information</strong></p>
<p>Certain product transactions may have taken place following a valid referral by a recognized affiliate introduction.
