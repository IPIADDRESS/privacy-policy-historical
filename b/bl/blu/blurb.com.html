</p>

<p>
    Blurb has implemented industry-standard electronic means of protecting your Personal Information. We store Personal
    Information behind a computer firewall, a barrier designed to prevent outsiders from accessing our servers, and we
    have implemented technology to detect intrusions. We also require you to enter a password to access your account
    information. In addition, Blurb protects your Personal Information from unauthorized physical access by storing your
    Personal Information in a controlled facility. Except as provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Blurb limits
    access to Personal Information in electronic databases to those persons (including employees and contractors) in
    Blurb’s organization who have a business need for such access. Lastly, we conduct regular internal audits and
    vulnerability scans to ensure compliance with these security measures and generate security incident logs that track
    Information useful in screening for attempted abuse of or unauthorized access to your Personal Information.
</p>

<p>
    Even though Blurb has taken significant steps to ensure that your Personal Information is not intercepted, accessed,
    used, or disclosed by unauthorized persons, you should know that Blurb cannot fully eliminate security risks
    associated with Personal Information.
