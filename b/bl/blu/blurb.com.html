<p>
    <strong>Personal Information Collected Via Technology</strong><br>
    As you navigate our Website, certain passive information may also be collected, including your Internet protocol
    address, browser type, domain names, access times, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data
    like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the
    solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed. This type of information is collected to make
    our services and solutions more useful to you.
</p>

<p>
    An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you
    use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you
    use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track IP
    Addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our web page flow.
</p>

<p>
    “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a web site sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing
    a web site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies
    (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience
    on the Website. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose
    to disable Cookies, some areas of the Website may not work properly.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Personal Information We Receive From Other Sources</strong><br>
    We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources like telephone or fax or from companies that
    provide our services by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website (“Partner Companies”). We may add this
    information to the information we have already collected from you via our Website in order to improve the products
    and services we provide.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Use of Information</strong><br>
    In general, Personal Information you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us
    in serving you better. We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with the Blurb newsletters, surveys,
    or promotional emails regarding changes and upgrades to our products and services and for other marketing purposes
    of Blurb or our partners, should you request to receive such communications from us.
</p>

<p>
    We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name)
    that make the information personally identifiable to you. We may use this Anonymous Information to analyze request
    patterns and usage patterns so that we may enhance our products and services. Blurb reserves the right to use and
    disclose Anonymous Information to third parties in its discretion.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Feedback</strong><br>

    We may enter into agreements with Partner Companies pursuant to which we provide the Partner Companies with a URL
    and a customer registration page co-branded with, or private labeled by, the Partner Companies, and the Partner
    Companies distributes and promotes the URL to its customers. A Partner Company may want access to Personal
    Information that we collect from their customers. As a result, if you register on the Website through a Partner
    Company, we may provide your Personal Information to the Partner Company. Because we do not control the privacy
    practices of our Partner Companies, you should read and understand their privacy policies.

    email to us at the email address set forth below.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Regarding Children</strong><br>

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Other Sites</strong><br>
    Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your convenience and does not signify our
    endorsement of such other website or location or its contents. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be

    security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or
    disclosure.
</p>

<p>
    Blurb has implemented industry-standard electronic means of protecting your Personal Information. We store Personal
    Information behind a computer firewall, a barrier designed to prevent outsiders from accessing our servers, and we
    have implemented technology to detect intrusions. We also require you to enter a password to access your account
    information. In addition, Blurb protects your Personal Information from unauthorized physical access by storing your
    Personal Information in a controlled facility. Except as provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Blurb limits
    access to Personal Information in electronic databases to those persons (including employees and contractors) in
    Blurb’s organization who have a business need for such access. Lastly, we conduct regular internal audits and
    vulnerability scans to ensure compliance with these security measures and generate security incident logs that track
    Information useful in screening for attempted abuse of or unauthorized access to your Personal Information.
</p>

<p>
    Even though Blurb has taken significant steps to ensure that your Personal Information is not intercepted, accessed,
    used, or disclosed by unauthorized persons, you should know that Blurb cannot fully eliminate security risks
    associated with Personal Information.
