              we also ask for the following optional information: Marital Status,

              all bluegreenvacations.com users combined. Occupation, income range

              relating to your vacation &amp; personal interests. This information 
              is combined with all other users to compile demographic information

              money savings offers if you choose to "opt-in" to our 
              mailing list. (Also a check box question)</p>
            <p>2. "Cookies" or other data collection methods<br>
              "Cookies" are small pieces of data that web sites send 
              to your computer's hard drive to identify that user or their preferences 
              when they return to that site. Cookies do not actually identify 
              a particular user, they identify the computer that was in use when 
              the cookie was sent. Most popular browser versions allow you to 
              either turn off accepting cookies, or to send you a warning before 
              you accept one. Although most users consider cookies harmless, we 
              feel that you certainly have the right to disable them if you wish. 
              At bluegreenvacations.com we do not currently employ any cookies within 
              our site. Some of bluegreenvacations.com's Advertisers &amp; Content 
              Providers do employ cookies bluegreenvacations.com does not have access 
              to these cookies, and has no control over, or access to the information 
              that is collected or how the information is used.</p>
            <p>3. Who bluegreenvacations.com shares user information with <br>
              bluegreenvacations.com does not share any personal information with 
              third parties unless you have requested to be on our mailing list 
              of special offers &amp; money saving promotions. If you have chosen 
              to join our opt-in mailing list, we will make every effort to only 
              send you information that corresponds to the preferences that you 
              chose when you signed-up. Joining our membership is never required 
              to enter any of our promotions, and you can easily remove yourself 
              from the list at any time.</p>
            <p>4. bluegreenvacations.com's policy for users who request to not have 
              their personal information shared with third parties<br>
              If you have concerns about us sharing your information with our 
              small "hand picked" group of marketing partners simply 
              click "no" for the answer to that question at sign-up. 
              Any change in bluegreenvacations.com's policy on information sharing 
              would be announced well in advance.</p>
            <p>5. Information collected by independent vendors &amp; service providers<br>
              bluegreenvacations.com maintains several agreements with third party 
              content and service providers. And in some cases, there are multiple 
              vendors involved in these agreements. Although bluegreenvacations.com 
              makes every effort to select and maintain agreements with only the 
              most professional and honest companies, it is still our opinion 
              that users should take the time to make themselves aware of the 
              privacy policies and terms of service (TOS) agreements of any third 
              party provider that requires the user to submit additional personal 
              information in order to use there service. This recommendation is 
              especially important in the future e-commerce areas of the bluegreenvacations.com 
              web site where credit card information may be required in order 
              to purchase products and services.</p>
            <p>6. bluegreenvacations.com's policy on allowing users to correct and/or 
              update stored personal information<br>
              Primarily for security purposes we do not currently maintain an 
              "editable" on-line database, however you can always request 
              an update of your personal information by e-mail.</p>
            <p>7. bluegreenvacations.com's policy on allowing users to delete all 
              stored information from the sites database. Any user wishing to 
              have their account and all stored information totally deleted from 
              the Bluegreenonline.com system can send an E-mail to our Webmaster 
              at our Contact Us page. Please include the words "delete my 
              account" in the subject line of the message, and a representative 
              will contact you to verify your request. Please note: Once your 
              account, and any related information has been deleted, there is 
              no way for us at bluegreenvacations.com to recover any of this data.</p>
            <p>8. bluegreenvacations.com's policy regarding collecting and storing 
              personal information provided by minors.<br>
              As the majority of the bluegreenvacations.com staff have children ourselves, 
              the security of personal information about minors is of utmost importance 
              to us. As such, we feel that children of any age should always consult 
              a parent or guardian before sharing any personal details with any 
              company or individual on the Internet. As all of our promotions 
              require the entrant to be 18 or over, we do not currently knowingly 
              except personal information from minors.</p>
            <p>9. Safeguarding Public or Shared Information<br>
              There are currently no areas of the bluegreenvacations.com web site 
              where any type of data would be visible to the public.</p>
            <p>10. Security of Stored Data<br>
              All personal information collected at registration is stored in 
              a secure environment, and is only accessible by bluegreenvacations.coms 
              webmaster. This information is archived only for the functionality 
              of the users account, and to collect broad demographic data on our 
              users as a group.</p>
            <p>11. Notification of changes to this privacy policy. As the bluegreenvacations.com 
              web site continues its beta period, and through the input of our 
              internal testers &amp; user feedback, there is a possibility that 
              we may alter the information that is collected on the bluegreenvacations.com 
              web site. Any change in bluegreenvacations.com's policy on information
