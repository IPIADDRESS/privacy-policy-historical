<h2>1. Information we collect </h2>
<p>We may collect information about our users in various ways. Namely, we may collect information that you provide to us, we may automatically collect information through your use of the Website, and we may collect information about you from other sources, such as publicly available sources or third parties.</p>
<h3>A. Information you provide to us</h3>
<p>You may provide to us personally identifiable information, which is information that could be used to identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, address, phone number or e-mail address (“personal information”) and other information about you, such as demographic information (zip code, gender or similar information) or certain information about your preferences and interests. The Website may collect information about you, including personal information, at various places and forms on the Website, including when you send us an e-mail, enter in contests and sweepstakes, subscribe to newsletters and clubs, submit a job application or post comments, or when you otherwise communicate or interact with us. You are solely responsible for your own personal information in instances where we have not requested that you submit such information to us.
Personal information once “de-identified” is not subject to this Privacy Policy and we may treat it as non-personal information and use it without obligation to you except as prohibited by applicable law.</p>
<h3>B. Information collected automatically</h3>
<p>We, as well as third-party advertisers, service providers and content providers, may use a variety of technologies (“Tracking Technologies”) that automatically collect certain Website usage information whenever you visit or interact with us (“usage information”). Usage information may include browser type, operating system, all of the areas within our sites and e-mails that you visit, including content that you browse, and the time of day, among other information. Usage information may also include your IP address or other unique identifier (“device identifier”) for the particular device you use to access the Website. A device identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access the Website and our servers identify your device by its device identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access our Website. </p>
<p>We may use usage information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Website and our other services. To the extent that we combine usage information with your personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>The methods that may be used to collect usage information include the following:</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>Cookies are small text files that are transferred to your device’s hard drive through your web browser which enable us to retain certain information about your use of the Website, including the date of your last visit to the Website, the pages you visit on the Website, the files you download on the Website and the type of browser you use. We also use cookies and other similar technologies to gather certain information which is generated by your device when you interact with the Website, such as your IP address, computer or mobile device operating system and browser type, the type of mobile device, the address of a referring website (if any), and the pages you visit on the Website. This information is transmitted to us automatically. Cookies may also identify your location. </p>
<p>Overall, cookies help us to determine the number of people who visit the Website and the frequency of these visits. They also allow us to personalize content, and respond to your requests regarding the Website, our services and shows. In addition, we may use cookies and a variety of other technologies on the Website that collect information for security and fraud detection purposes. You may set your browser to block cookies, including those associated with our services and shows. However, it is important to remember that certain features of the Website may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

<h4>Web beacons and pixels</h4>
<p>Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as pixels, 1x1 gifs or clear gifs) may be included in the Website pages and e-mail messages from us or our affiliates. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes including, without limitation, to count visitors to the sites, to monitor how users navigate the sites, to count how many e-mails sent were actually opened or to count how many forwarded links were actually viewed.</p>
<h4>Embedded scripts</h4>
<p>An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the sites, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
<h4>Location-identifying technologies</h4>

<p><strong>Other parties with your consent:</strong> If you have expressly indicated to us your consent to share information with other third parties that are not included in this list, we may share with such third parties the information you have provided us.

<h2>6. Links to Other Online Services and third parties</h2>
<p>The Website contains content from and hyperlinks to certain third parties' websites, locations, platforms, and serviced (“<strong>Third Party Services</strong>”). In addition, our Website contains Tracking Technologies operated by third parties. For example, we use certain third party analytics services, such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting and other integrated services that require Google Analytics to collect data, including the collection of data via cookies and other Tracking Technologies. Similarly, ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties may use Tracking Technologies on our Website and Third Party Services to track your activities across time and services, and tailor ads to you based on your activities, which may include sending you an ad on a Third Party Service or third party device after you have left the Website (“<strong>Interest-based Advertising</strong>”).</p>
<p>You may also choose to give us permission to access information about you from Third Party Services (for example, by linking to social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Tumblr and Snapchat). &nbsp;When you do so, you allow us to collect information based on your settings and in accordance with the privacy policies of such Third Party Services. It is your responsibility to control your settings and to read and understand those privacy policies. Please note, however, that the privacy settings you have set on such Third Party Services do not apply to the information that we have collected. The information we collect through these Third Party Services will be governed by this Privacy Policy. If you publicly reference our Website on a Third Party Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with us in a tweet or post), we may use your reference on or in connection with our Website.</p>
<p>Third party Services have privacy practices that may be different from this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by third parties, whether through our Website or a Third Party Service, remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We are not responsible for the manner in which your information may be used by said third parties, and encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. To the extent we combine information we receive from third parties with personal information we collect directly from you on the Website, we will treat the combined information as personal information under this privacy policy.</p>
<p>For further information on Tracking Technologies and your choices regarding them, please see “Information Collected Automatically” above and “Analytics and Advertising Choices” below.</p>

<p>California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how Blue Man Group responds to “Do Not Track” browser settings. If activated by you, this setting sends a special signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Blue Man Group does not respond to Do Not Track signals at this time because a uniform commercial standard has not yet been developed.
