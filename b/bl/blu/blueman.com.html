<h3>B. Information collected automatically</h3>

Usage information may include browser type, operating system, all of the areas within our sites and e-mails that you visit, including content that you browse, and the time of day, among other information. Usage information may also include your IP address or other unique identifier (“device identifier”) for the particular device you use to access the Website. A device identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access the Website and our servers identify your device by its device identifier.

<p>We may use usage information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Website and our other services. To the extent that we combine usage information with your personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>The methods that may be used to collect usage information include the following:</p>

However, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to help see to it that your information continues to be used in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires our business or assets, that company will have your information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your information as allowed by this privacy policy. </p>
<p><strong>Legal or administrative process: </strong>We may share your information with third parties if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce this Privacy Policy, to detect or prevent fraud, security or technical issues or to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.</p>
<p>We may also share other information with third parties in a manner that does not identify particular users, including, for example, aggregated data about how users are using our services. Please note that once we share your personal information in accordance with this Section, it shall be processed in accordance with such third parties’ privacy policies.</p>
<h2>4. Where your information will be stored</h2>
<p>Blue Man Group is headquartered in the United States. If you are accessing the Website from outside of the United States or Canada, please be aware that your information will be collected and stored on servers mainly in the United States and Canada. Data protection laws in the United States and Canada may be different from those of your country of residence. Your use of the Website or provision of any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing and storage of your information, including personal information, in the United States and Canada as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Your information may also be shared with, stored and/or processed by third parties as set out by this Privacy Policy who are located in other countries. For example, some of the service providers acting for us or on our behalf and that process or handle information on our behalf are located outside of the United States and Canada. As a result, your information may be transferred, stored and/or processed outside of the United States and Canada in connection with the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. While we use reasonable means to safeguard your personal information contractually or otherwise with such third parties, your personal information is subject to the legal requirements and governmental authorities of the foreign jurisdictions in which it is located (e.g. we may be legally required to disclose personal information to a governmental authority of a foreign jurisdiction in which your personal information is located).</p>
<h2>5. Right to access, correct or delete personal information</h2>
<p>Please note that we will retain and use your information only as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy (or for a longer period if required or permitted under applicable laws). You may contact us at any time to consult, correct or remove certain personal information that you have voluntarily submitted to us through the Website. All verifications, comments or requests related to your personal information must be sent in writing using one of the means indicated at the bottom of this page; for purposes of security you will be asked to provide information making it possible to identify you.</p>
<p>You can opt out from receiving e-mails from us or our affiliates at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mails you receive or by communicating with us using the contact information at the bottom of this page. Please note that your opt-out is limited to the e-mail address used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions or non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, transactions, servicing, or our ongoing business relations.</p>
<p>Please note that if you unsubscribe to receiving promotional communications, we may nonetheless continue to use your personal information for data analytics purposes.</p>
<h2>6. Links to Other Online Services and third parties</h2>
<p>The Website contains content from and hyperlinks to certain third parties' websites, locations, platforms, and serviced (“<strong>Third Party Services</strong>”). In addition, our Website contains Tracking Technologies operated by third parties. For example, we use certain third party analytics services, such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting and other integrated services that require Google Analytics to collect data, including the collection of data via cookies and other Tracking Technologies. Similarly, ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties may use Tracking Technologies on our Website and Third Party Services to track your activities across time and services, and tailor ads to you based on your activities, which may include sending you an ad on a Third Party Service or third party device after you have left the Website (“<strong>Interest-based Advertising</strong>”).</p>
<p>You may also choose to give us permission to access information about you from Third Party Services (for example, by linking to social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Tumblr and Snapchat). &nbsp;When you do so, you allow us to collect information based on your settings and in accordance with the privacy policies of such Third Party Services. It is your responsibility to control your settings and to read and understand those privacy policies. Please note, however, that the privacy settings you have set on such Third Party Services do not apply to the information that we have collected. The information we collect through these Third Party Services will be governed by this Privacy Policy. If you publicly reference our Website on a Third Party Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with us in a tweet or post), we may use your reference on or in connection with our Website.</p>
<p>Third party Services have privacy practices that may be different from this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by third parties, whether through our Website or a Third Party Service, remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We are not responsible for the manner in which your information may be used by said third parties, and encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. To the extent we combine information we receive from third parties with personal information we collect directly from you on the Website, we will treat the combined information as personal information under this privacy policy.</p>
<p>For further information on Tracking Technologies and your choices regarding them, please see “Information Collected Automatically” above and “Analytics and Advertising Choices” below.</p>
<h2>7. Analytics and advertising choices</h2>
<p>If you wish to opt-out of your data being used for Google Analytics, you may use one of the&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">currently available opt-outs</a></span>&nbsp;for the web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may exercise choices regarding receipt of Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt outs.&nbsp; Some of the advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("<strong>DAA</strong>") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.&nbsp; Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“<strong>NAI</strong>”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt out options for their members, see <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads.&nbsp; Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.</p>
<h2>8. Safeguard of your information</h2>
<p>We have adopted reasonable security procedures to help protect against loss and misuse of, and unauthorized access to, your information. While we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you share or transmit on the Website, and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction or inadvertent sharing of your information.</p>
<h2>9. Collection of children's personal information</h2>
<p>The Website is intended for a general audience and not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information as defined by the United States Children’s Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) of children under the age of 13 in a manner not permitted by COPPA. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have collected such information in a manner not permitted by COPPA, please communicate with us using the contact information at the bottom of this page, and we will remove such information to the extent required by COPPA.</p>
<h2 id="californiaprivacy">10. Your California privacy rights</h2>
<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (known as the “Shine the Light” law), customers who are residents of California may request certain information about our disclosure of their information during the prior calendar year to third parties and, in some cases, affiliates for those third parties’ and affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Blue Man Group may share personal information as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” law with third parties and/or affiliates for such third parties’ and affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and wish to obtain information about our compliance with this law, please communicate with us using the contact information at the bottom of this page. Requests must include “California Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that Blue Man Group is not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided addresses.</p>
<p>California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how Blue Man Group responds to “Do Not Track” browser settings. If activated by you, this setting sends a special signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Blue Man Group does not respond to Do Not Track signals at this time because a uniform commercial standard has not yet been developed. If we do so in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy to reflect this. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com">http://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>
