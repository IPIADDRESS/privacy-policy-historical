          Blue Man Group has no intention of collecting any personal data from

          Group will specifically instruct children not to submit such information 
          on our websites and/or will take reasonable steps to ensure parental 
          consent to such submission. If we know that a child under 13 has sent 
          us personal information, we will automatically delete the information 
          from our system. If you would like to grant your child permission to 
          receive e-mail updates or to allow him or her to use our chat rooms 
          or message board, please fill out our <a href="community/parental.shtml">permission

          Blue Man Group uses state of the art software to protect the information 
          we receive through our website. All financial information we receive, 
          such as credit card numbers, are encrypted and cannot be read as it 
          moves through the Internet. We use Network Associates Pretty Good Privacy, 
          PGP, to encrypt the information you send us through our Checkout, so 
          that it cannot be read in transit. When you enter our Checkout page 
          you are in a secure area of our server. This can be noted by the closed 
          lock in the bottom left of your browser window. Whether you pay by credit 
          card, check, or money order, all of your account and order information 
          (including your credit card information, mailing addresses, email address 
          and telephone number) will be encrypted to ensure your privacy. While 
          no data can be guaranteed 100% secured, Blue Man Group takes the security 
          of your personal information seriously. We continually strive to protect 
          your information, but Blue Man Group cannot warrant the security of 
          any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. </font></p>
