<strong>About <a href="http://www.blueworld.co.za">Blueworld.co.za</a></strong><br>
Blueworld.co.za is an online service that allows our members to set up unique personal profiles that can be linked together through networks of friends. Blueworld members can view each others' profiles, communicate with old friends and meet new friends on the service, share photos, post journals and comments, and describe their interests. To enrich our members' experience, we request and display some personal information to other members and visitors, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their network of friends. Blueworld members can change their profile information at any time and can control how other members and the service communicates with them.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Blueworld.co.za</strong> cares deeply about online privacy If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@bwcom.co.za">privacy@bwcom.co.za</a>.
<br>
<br>

User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes
<br>
<br>
User Profile information including members' pictures and first names are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the Blueworld.co.za social networking community. Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join Blueworld to add users to members' friends' networks, and to send notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting friends, adding friends, and notifications, a user's email address is not shared or displayed to people within a user's personal network. Users within a personal network communicate on blueworld.co.za with each other through the blueworld.co.za service, without disclosing their email addresses.
