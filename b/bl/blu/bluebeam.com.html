										<b>Who is Collecting Your Information?</b>
										</p>
										<p>
										When you provide information through the Site, the information is transmitted 
										through the Internet and stored on servers owned and maintained by Bluebeam or 
										its designated service providers which Bluebeam may from time to time engage to 
										host and maintain the Site, facilitate processing or fulfillment of product and 
										service orders made through use of the Site, or provide additional Site support 
										or other services. You will be informed if any third party other than a 
										Bluebeam service provider is involved in collecting information from you 
										through use of the Site. In such situations, you can elect not to share the 
										information requested.</p>
										<p>
										Bluebeam affiliates and partners and other entities (such as software companies 
										and other Web sites that publish online reviews and/or offer online discussion 
										groups) that have links on the Site may also collect information about you when 
										you visit their Web sites or otherwise communicate with them. Although we 
										encourage such third parties to adopt and follow their own consumer privacy 
										policies, we are not responsible for their collection and use of user 
										information. The information practices of those Web sites linked to the Site 
										are not covered by this Privacy Policy. You should refer to the privacy 
										policies and statements of other Web sites or contact the respective Webmasters 
										of those Web sites to obtain information regarding their information 
										collection, use and disclosure policies.</p>
										<p>
										<b>With Whom Do We Share Your Information?</b>
										</p>
										<p>
											We are not in the business of collecting user information for sale to others. 
											We will share the personal or company identifying information we collect from 
											you only with your consent or under the following circumstances:
											</p><ul>
												<li>
													<i>Service providers</i>. We may use other companies and individuals to 
												perform supporting functions for the various products and services offered 
												through our Site on our behalf. These service providers will not be permitted 
												to use the information collected from you for any purpose other than performing 
												the support functions for Bluebeam and/or offering additional services, 
												promotions or other offers to you.</li>
												<li>
													<i>Bluebeam affiliates and partners</i>. We work closely with our worldwide 
												affiliates with whom we may share user information. In addition, we may share 
												user information with Bluebeam partners and service providers.</li>
												<li>
													<i>Protection of rights</i>. We will release user information if we believe 
												that such action is appropriate to: (1) comply with legal process, (2) enforce 
												the Terms of Use Agreement for the Site, or (3) protect the rights, property, 
												or personal safety of Bluebeam, its employees, other Site users or others.</li>
												<li>
													<i>Asset transfers</i>. We continue to develop our business and in doing so 
													might choose to buy other businesses or assets. User information is generally 
													one of the transferred assets acquired in such purchases. Also, if we should 
													choose to sell some or all of our assets, user information, including the 
													information collected from you through this Site, could be included in the 
													transferred assets.</li>
											</ul>
										<p></p>
										<p>
										In all other circumstances, if we disclose any user information to a third 
										party it will be in the form of aggregated statistical data that doesn't 
										identify any user individually. This non-identifying information may include, 
										for example, the purchasing patterns, trends, preferences and other collective 
										characteristics of our users and serves to help us, our affiliates and others 
										evaluate and tailor our communications, advertisements, products, services and 
										general business practices.</p>
										<p>
										<b>Control of Your Information</b>
										</p>
										<p>
										You can correct and update the information you provide Bluebeam by contacting 
										our Webmaster at <a href="mailto:support@bluebeam.com">support@bluebeam.com</a>. 
										From time to time, Bluebeam may provide you through email, postal mail, 
										telephone solicitations, and/or in-person sales calls information on Bluebeam 
										or its various products or services. You can opt-out of receiving these types 
										of communications by contacting our Webmaster at <a href="mailto:support@bluebeam.com">
										support@bluebeam.com</a>. Please be advised that once your information is
										disclosed to a Bluebeam affiliate, partner or service provider in accordance
										with this Privacy Policy, we do not provide a means of opting-out of any
										communications that affiliate, partner or service provider may send to you and
										we advise that you contact such affiliate, partner or service provider directly
										for more information on any available opt-out procedures.</p>
										<p>
										<b>Bulletin Boards and Chat Rooms</b>
										</p>
										<p>
										We may from time to time provide chat sessions and rooms, forums, message 
										boards and/or bulletin boards for users to receive information about products 
										and various topics. Please remember that any information disclosed in these 
										areas may be viewed by other users of the Site. If you post on any of these 
										areas, please use care not to disclose any personal or company identifying 
										information. We are not responsible or liable for the uses that others may make 
										of the information you post on any of these areas.</p>
										<p>
										<b>Security</b>
										</p>
										<p>
										We use technology designed to protect user information and transmissions made 
										through our Site. The personal or company identifying information that you 
										provide us is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with 
										restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure 
										the security of such information. In addition, all Bluebeam personnel who have 
										access to such information are trained in the maintenance and security of such 
										information, and we limit access of such information by our employees to the 
										information reasonably required in order to provide prompt, high quality 
										service. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to 
										be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect user information, we 
										cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or 
										from our Site and you engage in such transmissions at your own risk. Once we 
										receive a transmission from you, we will attempt to ensure its security on our 
										systems.</p>
										<p>
										<b>Children’s Privacy</b>
										</p>
										<p>
										Our Site is a general audience Web site and no portion of the Site is directed 
										to children under the age of 13. We do not collect personal identifying 
										information from any person we actually know is a child under the age of 13.</p>
										<p>
