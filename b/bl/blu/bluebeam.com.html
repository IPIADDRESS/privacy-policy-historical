											Protecting your privacy is important to us at Bluebeam Software Inc. 
											("Bluebeam"). This Web site ("Site") is a general corporate Web site, through 
											which we provide information about us and our various products and services, 
											and make our software products available for download. We use information that 
											we collect from you to improve your experience in using the Site and our 
											various products and services, to aid in communications among Bluebeam and you 
											and other Site users and to notify you of products and services that we think 
											may be of interest to you. Please read on for more details concerning our 
											Privacy Policy.

												What Personal Information Does Bluebeam Collect?
												</p><ul class="con1">
													<li>
														<b>Information You Give Us</b>: We collect information you choose to 
													provide us through the Site or through email. For example, we obtain 
													information when you complete a feedback form, contact us requesting 
													information, complete purchasing and product registration forms, respond to a 
													survey, enter a contest, or participate in a news group, bulletin board or chat 
													room. This information may include, for example, your name, email address, 
													postal address, phone number, company name, job title, and information about 
													your company including the number of employees, revenue size and the type of 
													software and hardware the company owns or uses. Purchase order forms may also 
													request credit card or other billing information. You can choose not to provide 
													us with certain personal and company information, but then you may not be able 
													to fully take advantage of the features of our Site and we may not be able to 
													provide you with requested information about our products and services.
													</li><li>
														<b>Automatic Collection of Information</b>: Like many Web sites on the 
														Internet, we automatically track certain information about you as you use our 
														Site. This information may include, for example, your IP address, the URLs and 
														Site pages you’ve visited, the number of times you visited each Site page, what 
														downloads you made, how long you spent logged-on to particular sections of the 
														Site and to the Site in general, and your browser type. In addition, we may 
														employ the use of “cookies” in certain areas of our Site to allow us to provide 
														information which is targeted to your interests and to make your online 
														experience more convenient. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to 
														your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most 
														cookies we may use will be “session cookies,” meaning that they will be 
														automatically deleted at the end of a Site visit. You are always free to 
														decline any cookies we use if your browser permits.</li>
												</ul>
											<p class="title1">
											Who is Collecting Your Information?
											</p><p class="con1">
											When you provide information through the Site, the information is transmitted 
											through the Internet and stored on servers owned and maintained by Bluebeam or 
											its designated service providers which Bluebeam may from time to time engage to 
											host and maintain the Site, facilitate processing or fulfillment of product and 
											service orders made through use of the Site, or provide additional Site support 
											or other services. You will be informed if any third party other than a 
											Bluebeam service provider is involved in collecting information from you 
											through use of the Site. In such situations, you can elect not to share the 
											information requested.
											</p><p class="con1">
											Bluebeam affiliates and partners and other entities (such as software companies 
											and other Web sites that publish online reviews and/or offer online discussion 
											groups) that have links on the Site may also collect information about you when 
											you visit their Web sites or otherwise communicate with them. Although we 
											encourage such third parties to adopt and follow their own consumer privacy 
											policies, we are not responsible for their collection and use of user 
											information. The information practices of those Web sites linked to the Site 
											are not covered by this Privacy Policy. You should refer to the privacy 
											policies and statements of other Web sites or contact the respective Webmasters 
											of those Web sites to obtain information regarding their information 
											collection, use and disclosure policies.
											</p><p class="title1">
											With Whom Do We Share Your Information?
											</p><p class="con1">
												We are not in the business of collecting user information for sale to others.

												you only with your consent or under the following circumstances:
												</p><ul class="con1">
													<li>
														<i>Service providers</i>. We may use other companies and individuals to 
													perform supporting functions for the various products and services offered 
													through our Site on our behalf. These service providers will not be permitted 
													to use the information collected from you for any purpose other than performing 
													the support functions for Bluebeam and/or offering additional services, 
													promotions or other offers to you.
													</li><li>
														<i>Bluebeam affiliates and partners</i>. We work closely with our worldwide 
													affiliates with whom we may share user information. In addition, we may share 
													user information with Bluebeam partners and service providers.
													</li><li>
														<i>Protection of rights</i>. We will release user information if we believe 
													that such action is appropriate to: (1) comply with legal process, (2) enforce 
													the Terms of Use Agreement for the Site, or (3) protect the rights, property, 
													or personal safety of Bluebeam, its employees, other Site users or others.
													</li><li>
														<i>Asset transfers</i>. We continue to develop our business and in doing so 
														might choose to buy other businesses or assets. User information is generally 
														one of the transferred assets acquired in such purchases. Also, if we should 
														choose to sell some or all of our assets, user information, including the 
														information collected from you through this Site, could be included in the 
														transferred assets.</li>
												</ul>
											<p class="con1">
											In all other circumstances, if we disclose any user information to a third 
											party it will be in the form of aggregated statistical data that doesn't 
											identify any user individually. This non-identifying information may include, 
											for example, the purchasing patterns, trends, preferences and other collective 
											characteristics of our users and serves to help us, our affiliates and others 
											evaluate and tailor our communications, advertisements, products, services and 
											general business practices.
											</p><p class="title1">
											Control of Your Information
											</p><p class="con1">
												You can correct and update the information you provide Bluebeam by contacting 
												our Webmaster at <a href="mailto:support@bluebeam.com">support@bluebeam.com</a>. 
												From time to time, Bluebeam may provide you through email, postal mail, 
												telephone solicitations, and/or in-person sales calls information on Bluebeam 
												or its various products or services. You can opt-out of receiving these types

											affiliate, partner or service provider directly for more information on any 
											available opt-out procedures.

											Bulletin Boards and Chat Rooms
											</p><p class="con1">
											We may from time to time provide chat sessions and rooms, forums, message 
											boards and/or bulletin boards for users to receive information about products 
											and various topics. Please remember that any information disclosed in these 
											areas may be viewed by other users of the Site. If you post on any of these 
											areas, please use care not to disclose any personal or company identifying 
											information. We are not responsible or liable for the uses that others may make 
											of the information you post on any of these areas.
											</p><p class="title1">
											Security
											</p><p class="con1">
											We use technology designed to protect user information and transmissions made 
											through our Site. The personal or company identifying information that you 
											provide us is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with 
											restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure 
											the security of such information. In addition, all Bluebeam personnel who have 
											access to such information are trained in the maintenance and security of such 
											information, and we limit access of such information by our employees to the 
											information reasonably required in order to provide prompt, high quality 
											service. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to 
											be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect user information, we 
											cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or 
											from our Site and you engage in such transmissions at your own risk. Once we 
											receive a transmission from you, we will attempt to ensure its security on our 
											systems.
