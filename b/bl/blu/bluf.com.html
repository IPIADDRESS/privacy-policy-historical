 <h1>BLUF Privacy</h1>
 <p>Version: en-1, 12 April 2018</p>
 <h2>BLUF Data Protection terms and conditions update</h2>
<p>BLUF Ltd, the company that operates BLUF.com, stores and processes your personal data. To ensure ongoing compliance with European Union data protection laws, including, but not limited to, the General Data Protection Regulation, which comes into force on May 25, 2018, (“GDPR”), we need you need to agree to the terms and conditions below to continue to use BLUF.com. This document explains the information we store and process;  you must consent to it to remain a member of BLUF.com. If you do not consent to it, your profile will be removed from BLUF.com and your data will be irrevocably deleted.</p>
<p>Your consent to these terms provides the legal basis on which we store and process your data.</p>
<h3>If you are not a member of BLUF.com</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your email address will be stored if you request a subscription to one of our mailing lists, along with your IP address and the date on which you requested a subscription. Your address will be used to send you the information you requested, and bi-monthly reminders of how to change your subscriptions. If you unsubscribe, your data will be deleted within two months.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data that we store and process on BLUF.com if you are a member</h3>
<p>This is the information that we store about you, and how it is processed to provide the functionality of the BLUF.com website (“site”) and apps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your email address is used to help identify your BLUF.com account and to send you notifications about your account, or other email messages that you have chosen to receive.</li>
<li>Your profile text, tags, the locations you enter and other data that makes up your profile, such as club memberships, is stored and used to display your profile to other members, and to allow other members to search for profiles.</li>
<li>Your photos are stored in order that they may be displayed to other members alongside your profile details, or in lists of members (for example "Online now").</li>
<li>Messages you send to, and receive from, other members, or post in the BLUF forum or database are stored on our servers.</li>
<li>A record of updates to your account (including, but not limited to, travel plans, change of name, new photos added) is stored to enable the display of member activity ("Today on BLUF") and lists of members with recent updates.</li>
<li>A record of profiles you have visited is kept to enable you to view your history of profile views, and so that we can tell other members when you viewed their profile.</li>
<li>Your preferences are stored, to enable us to display the site in your preferred language, as well as other options, such as the number of members to display per page, the site colour scheme, order of displaying members and so on.</li>
<li>Your login, logout and last activity times for each session are stored in our database, to enable session management (for example, logging you off if you leave your computer).</li>
<li>The IP address from which you connect to BLUF.com may be stored, as part of our security checks.</li>
<li>The type of computer or software you use to connect to BLUF.com may be stored, and used to help us ensure the site and/or apps are compatible with as many members as possible, or to display information in the manner best suited to your device (including, but not limited to automatically selecting a language for you, based on information supplied by your web browser).</li>
<li>Other information may be stored and processed to provide the functions of the BLUF site and apps, for example, indicating if you are the author of an article, or are entitled to a BLUF card, or if you have given an app on one of your mobile devices permission to access BLUF.com.</li>
<li>If you have administrative privileges on BLUF.com, additional information will be stored to create an audit trail of administrative actions you have taken, such as editing event information, publishing a blog or magazine article, or sending a mailshot.</li>
