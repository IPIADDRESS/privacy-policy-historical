<h2>Collection and Use of Information by BlueHornet</h2>

<p>Your personal information is used to create your personal access to products on the site, and to contact you in the course of using the products.&nbsp; Your personal information may also be transferred to us from another Company in order to send you emails that you have requested.&nbsp; Financial information that is collected is used to verify your identity, to pay for a product or service, or to bill either you or your company for products and services, as applicable. Demographic and profile data collected by BlueHornet is used to optimize our Website or any requested email communications, and to display information that is more relevant to you.</p>

<p>Your email address is used to send you information that you have requested. As part of your use of any BlueHornet product, BlueHornet allows you to elect to receive, or not receive, certain information from BlueHornet. BlueHornet adheres strictly to permission-based email policy. BlueHornet will not send you unsolicited email information, commercial offers or advertisements. All emails that you have requested, other than transactional emails, will include an option to unsubscribe. Unsubscribe requests are fulfilled promptly and no further communications will be sent to users who have stated that they do not wish to receive the specified information.</p>

<h2>Cookies and Web Beacons </h2>

<h3>Cookies.</h3>
<p>A “cookie” is a small text file that is transferred to your computer by our Web server.&nbsp; We may use two types of cookies—“session cookies” and “persistent cookies.”</p>

<h3>Session Cookies.</h3>
<p>A “session cookie” is a temporary cookie that expires when you close your browser.&nbsp; A session cookie assigns a randomly-generated, unique identification number to your computer when you access our Site or open our email.&nbsp; Assigning your computer a number facilitates the proper functioning of the features of our Web site and email, by permitting us to maintain a persistent “state” for your session.&nbsp; We also use session cookies to collect information about the ways visitors use this Web site or an email – which pages are visited, which links are used, and how long a user stays on each page.&nbsp; We analyze this information (known as “clickstream information”) to better understand our visitors’ interests and needs and to improve the content and functionality of this Web site and our emails.</p>

<h3>Persistent Cookies.</h3>
<p>When you visit this Web site, or open an email from us,&nbsp; we may place one or more “persistent cookies” on your computer.&nbsp; Unlike a “session cookie,” a persistent cookie does not expire when you close your browser.&nbsp; It stays on your computer until it expires (for example, at the end of the calendar year) or until you delete it.</p>

<p>Some persistent cookies simply “tag” your computer so that the next time you visit (or someone using your computer visits), our server will recognize you, not by name, but by the “tag” on your computer.&nbsp; This will enable us to provide you with a personalized experience even if we do not know who you are.&nbsp; It will also allow us to collect more accurate information about the ways people use this Web site, and our emails, for example, how people use this Web site on their first visit and how often they return.&nbsp; If, at some point, you create a user identity, we may link the information collected by these persistent cookies to information in our database that identifies you personally.&nbsp; We may also transfer this information to a cookie and place it on your computer’s hard drive so that our web server can read this information each time you visit this Web site or click on an email.&nbsp; In either case, using persistent cookies permits us to provide you with a more personalized experience and, in some cases, may save you the trouble of re-entering information already in our database.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer.&nbsp; You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave our Web site.&nbsp; Although you are not required to accept our cookies, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of this Web site.&nbsp; For example, you will not be able to purchase products and services on this Web site.</p>

<h3>Web Beacons.</h3>
<p>Web beacons (also referred to as “tracking pixels” or “action tags”) are graphic images, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, placed at various locations on our Site and in our emails.&nbsp; Web beacons help us recognize the cookies on your browser.&nbsp; Like cookies, Web beacons help us collect information about the ways visitors use our Site.&nbsp; They also help us identify browser types, IP addresses, search terms that bring visitors to our Site, and the domain names of the Web sites that refer traffic to us.&nbsp; The information collected by Web beacons does not identify you personally.&nbsp; However, if you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this Web site, for example, by making a purchase, we may link the information we collect using Web beacons to the information that identifies you personally and use it in the same ways as we use the information we collect using cookies.&nbsp; Lastly, we utilize web beacons to provide us with more information on any emails we send out, in particular, the web beacons will send us information to let us know that you have received and opened any e-mail you have chosen to receive from us. </p>

<h2>Information Use by Third Parties</h2>

<h3>Our Partners.</h3>
<p>BlueHornet is an online service provider. We pass on to our Partner the privacy preferences you have expressed from an email you have responded to. For example, if you have asked to be added to our Partner’s mailing lists, we will pass on that information.&nbsp; If you have declined an opportunity to be added to our Partner’s mailing lists, we will also pass on that information.</p>

<h3>Our Service Providers.</h3>
<p>BlueHornet employs other companies, including our affiliates, to provide services to us or on our behalf.&nbsp; For example, we may use other companies to maintain this Web site, to process payments, detect and prevent fraud, deliver packages, send mail or email, provide customer service, or analyze various clickstream data and consumer behavior.&nbsp; These companies are required by contract to use the personal information we share with them only to perform services to us or on our behalf and to protect the confidentiality of your personal information.</p>

<p>
</p><h3>As Disclosed in a Privacy Notice.</h3>
<p>We may share specific personal information as disclosed in a specific Privacy Notice posted on the page or area of this Web site where you provided that information.</p>

<h3>To Comply With Legal Requirements, Cooperate With Law Enforcement, Prevent Fraud and Other Crimes, and Protect Legal Rights, Property, You and Others.</h3>
<p>There are other limited circumstances in which we may share the personal information in our databases with unrelated third parties.&nbsp; For example, we may disclose the personal information we collect on this Site or in an email without notifying you when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or a regulatory requirement; to comply with a subpoena or court order; to cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental investigations (without necessarily requiring the law enforcement or government agency requesting the information to formally serve us with a subpoena); to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to enforce a contract; to protect the legal rights, property or safety of BlueHornet our affiliates, our employees, agents, other users or the public in general or to protect your vital interests.&nbsp; We also reserve the right to report to appropriate law enforcement or government agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful without providing notice to you.</p>

<h3>In Connection With Corporate Events.</h3>
<p>We may transfer your personal information to another company (either an affiliate of BlueHornet or an unrelated third party) that has acquired the stock or assets of BlueHornet, one of our affiliates, or one of our operating divisions, for example, as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation.&nbsp; If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company’s use of your personal information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy, any applicable Privacy Notices, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us Contact Lists, Campaign Content and Campaign Reports.&nbsp; BlueHornet is currently owned by Digital River, Inc.</p>

<p>BlueHornet ensures that all contact lists, email content and reports remain private and confidential. Any use of BlueHornet systems must be in compliance with our Acceptable Use Policy - to protect against inappropriate use (illegal, abusive, obscene, threatening, etc.).&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong> BlueHornet will not sell, rent, loan or allow external access to a customer’s contact lists.</strong> Nor will BlueHornet themselves use customer’s contact lists for any purpose other than those agreed to in writing. </p>
