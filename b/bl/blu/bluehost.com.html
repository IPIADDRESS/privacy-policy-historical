                                which are necessary for Bluehost's website to work. In addition, cookies are used to

                                increased convenience as described in more detail below.</p>

                                        <p>For Bluehost Subscribers, Bluehost uses "functional cookies" to
                                        store user names for added convenience. For example, the cookie would contain a piece of
                                        identifying information such as a customer ID, username, or session ID that would be used to
                                        look up the customer ID. Bluehost offers password-protected, web-based management
                                        tools as part of its webhosting packages. By storing a Subscriber's username in a cookie,
                                        the Subscriber will not have to fill out form fields each time he or she manages the
                                        account. (The cookie does not store passwords.)</p>

                                        Pixel tags and cookies may be used in those email messages to help Bluehost

                                <p>The information collected from Subscribers is used to manage each Subscriber's account (such as
                                for billing and account management purposes) and to promote other products or services that
                                Bluehost believes may be of interest to its Subscribers. Bluehost may also
                                generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from information that Subscribers provide during
                                registration (such as the total number of Subscribers in a given category, but not their names).
                                As explained in more detail below, Bluehost may in certain instances use this
                                aggregated and non-identifying information to promote advertisements that appear on
                                Bluehost's website and in connection with its services. Any such aggregated and

                                information that it produces, is proprietary information of Bluehost.</p>

                                optimize Bluehost's website. Bluehost also gathers broad demographic
                                information from this data to help improve its website and make your browsing and purchasing

                                partners who work with or on behalf of Bluehost, and are subject to specific
                                confidentiality agreements, Bluehost will not provide or sell to any third party your
                                personal information and will keep all Subscriber information confidential, subject to the
                                following:</p>

                                <p>Upon registration for Bluehost services, certain Subscriber information may be
                                transferred to trusted affiliated or unaffiliated third parties that help Bluehost
                                provide certain services or that provide certain services on Bluehost's behalf. For
                                example, Subscriber information may be transferred to Bluehost's affiliated registrar,
                                FastDomain (WHOIS Domain Name Registration Information), or to unaffiliated third parties that help
                                Bluehost provide email services or SSL certifications.</p>

                                <p>Some services are offered or promoted in conjunction with a Bluehost partner or
                                sponsor. For example, Bluehost may partner with other corporate affiliates of Endurance
                                or with trusted non-affiliated partners for co-promotions of a particular product or service.
                                Bluehost may share certain Subscriber contact information but no billing information with
                                Bluehost's partner or sponsor in order to provide the relevant services or to run the
                                promotion. If Bluehost shares Subscriber information with partners and sponsors,
                                Bluehost requires that they maintain the Subscriber information in confidence, and use the
                                information solely for purposes of providing the services or carrying out the agreed upon
                                promotion.</p>

                                <h3>Online Advertisements.</h3>
                                <p>Bluehost does not share personally identifiable information about individual users
                                with advertisers. Bluehost may display online advertisements and share aggregated and
                                non-identifying information about Subscribers collected through the registration process or through
                                online surveys and promotions with certain advertisers. This aggregated and non-identifying
                                information may be used to deliver tailored advertisements. For example, an advertiser may tell
                                Bluehost the audience it wants to reach (e.g., males between 25 and 55 years of age) and
                                provide Bluehost with an advertisement tailored to that audience. Based upon the
                                aggregated and non-identifying information collected by Bluehost, Bluehost may
                                then display the advertisement to the intended audience.</p>

                                above, Bluehost may share aggregated, non-personally identifying information obtained
                                from customer surveys within the Endurance corporate family or with third parties.</p>

                                governmental entities or individuals outside of Bluehost if we believe, in good faith, that the
                                law requires us to do so. This may include, but is not limited to, responding to subpoenas, 
                                court orders or other legal processes (such as law enforcement requests). Bluehost may access,
                                preserve and share Subscriber information as necessary to: establish or exercise Bluehost's legal
                                rights or defend against any legal claim including threatened claims involving Bluehost based on
                                the anonymity of a domain name; investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected fraud 
                                or other illegal activities; prevent death or serious physical harm to any person; or investigate
                                violations of Bluehost's Terms of Service.</p>

                                <p>In certain jurisdictions or pursuant to the rules of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
                                and Numbers ("ICANN") or certain registries, Domain Name Registration Information has to be made
                                available and accessible to the public through a "WHOIS" search. The WHOIS database is a publicly
                                accessible database that lists the Domain Name Registration Information for a particular domain
                                name, the name server(s) to which the domain name points, and the domain name's creation and
                                expiration date. The Domain Name Registration Information you provide is hosted by Bluehost
                                or a third party service provider and is made available to the public through WHOIS searches.
                                Bluehost may deposit your Domain Name Registration Information with a third-party escrow
                                provider to comply with ICANN requirements. At times, Subscribers may receive solicitations that
                                result from searches of the publicly available WHOIS database by other companies or individuals. Any
                                such solicitations or SPAM do not come from Bluehost and Bluehost does not
                                control the use of WHOIS information by third parties.</p>
