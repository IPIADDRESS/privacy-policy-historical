                                <p>Subscribers are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for
                                Bluehost services including name, postal address, email address, telephone number, and
                                billing information (such as a credit card number). In addition, to register a domain name,
                                Subscribers are asked to provide this information for the registrant, administrative contact,
                                technical contact and billing contact of the domain name (collectively, "Domain Name Registration

                                and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets
                                may be hosted by a third party or directly on Bluehost's website. Your interactions with

                                <p>Bluehost uses different types of cookies (which are electronic collections of
                                information stored on a local computer that are used by websites to keep track of visitors and
                                registered users and to relate one computer transaction to a later one) and other methods of
                                uniquely tracking visitors for different purposes. For example, some cookies are "required cookies"
                                which are necessary for Bluehost's website to work. In addition, cookies are used to
                                provide Bluehost's existing Subscribers with the opportunity for continued savings and
                                increased convenience as described in more detail below.</p>

                                        <p>Bluehost uses "performance cookies" to inform Bluehost of a repeat
                                        visit. However, these cookies do not tell Bluehost who a visitor is, the
                                        visitor's name, email address, or passwords.</p>

                                        <p>To offer Bluehost Subscribers continued savings, Bluehost uses
                                        cookies to help monitor the traffic generated from Bluehost banners and logo
                                        buttons displayed on Bluehost Subscribers' websites.</p>
                                    </li>

                                        <h3>Cookies for Subscriber Account Management.</h3>
                                        <p>For Bluehost Subscribers, Bluehost uses "functional cookies" to
                                        store user names for added convenience. For example, the cookie would contain a piece of
                                        identifying information such as a customer ID, username, or session ID that would be used to
                                        look up the customer ID. Bluehost offers password-protected, web-based management
                                        tools as part of its webhosting packages. By storing a Subscriber's username in a cookie,
                                        the Subscriber will not have to fill out form fields each time he or she manages the
                                        account. (The cookie does not store passwords.)</p>
                                    </li>

                                        <h3>Cookies for Advertising.</h3>
                                        <p>Bluehost may also utilize "advertising cookies" to track referrals from
                                        internal and external affiliates, as well as advertising campaigns. Bluehost may
                                        also use a third party service provider to send emails that you have agreed to receive.
                                        Pixel tags and cookies may be used in those email messages to help Bluehost
                                        measure the effectiveness of its advertising and to enable Bluehost to provide
                                        more focused marketing communications to you.</p>

                                <p>The information collected from Subscribers is used to manage each Subscriber's account (such as
                                for billing and account management purposes) and to promote other products or services that
                                Bluehost believes may be of interest to its Subscribers. Bluehost may also

                                information that it produces, is proprietary information of Bluehost.</p>

                                partners who work with or on behalf of Bluehost, and are subject to specific
                                confidentiality agreements, Bluehost will not provide or sell to any third party your

                                following:</p>

                                <p>Upon registration for Bluehost services, certain Subscriber information may be
                                transferred to trusted affiliated or unaffiliated third parties that help Bluehost
                                provide certain services or that provide certain services on Bluehost's behalf. For
                                example, Subscriber information may be transferred to Bluehost's affiliated registrar,
                                FastDomain (WHOIS Domain Name Registration Information), or to unaffiliated third parties that help
                                Bluehost provide email services or SSL certifications.</p>

                                <p>Some services are offered or promoted in conjunction with a Bluehost partner or
                                sponsor. For example, Bluehost may partner with other corporate affiliates of Endurance
                                or with trusted non-affiliated partners for co-promotions of a particular product or service.
                                Bluehost may share certain Subscriber contact information but no billing information with
                                Bluehost's partner or sponsor in order to provide the relevant services or to run the
                                promotion. If Bluehost shares Subscriber information with partners and sponsors,
                                Bluehost requires that they maintain the Subscriber information in confidence, and use the
                                information solely for purposes of providing the services or carrying out the agreed upon
                                promotion.</p>

                                <p>Bluehost does not share personally identifiable information about individual users
                                with advertisers. Bluehost may display online advertisements and share aggregated and

                                online surveys and promotions with certain advertisers. This aggregated and non-identifying
                                information may be used to deliver tailored advertisements. For example, an advertiser may tell
                                Bluehost the audience it wants to reach (e.g., males between 25 and 55 years of age) and
                                provide Bluehost with an advertisement tailored to that audience. Based upon the
                                aggregated and non-identifying information collected by Bluehost, Bluehost may
                                then display the advertisement to the intended audience.</p>

                                above, Bluehost may share aggregated, non-personally identifying information obtained

                                involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations or suspected violations

                                <p>In certain jurisdictions or pursuant to the rules of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
                                and Numbers ("ICANN") or certain registries, Domain Name Registration Information has to be made
                                available and accessible to the public through a "WHOIS" search. The WHOIS database is a publicly
                                accessible database that lists the Domain Name Registration Information for a particular domain
                                name, the name server(s) to which the domain name points, and the domain name's creation and
                                expiration date. The Domain Name Registration Information you provide is hosted by Bluehost
                                or a third party service provider and is made available to the public through WHOIS searches.
                                Bluehost may deposit your Domain Name Registration Information with a third-party escrow
                                provider to comply with ICANN requirements. At times, Subscribers may receive solicitations that
                                result from searches of the publicly available WHOIS database by other companies or individuals. Any
                                such solicitations or SPAM do not come from Bluehost and Bluehost does not
                                control the use of WHOIS information by third parties.</p>

                                domain name, Bluehost may seek assurance from you, the customer, concerning your promise

                                Bluehost and may result in deactivation of your domain name and disclosure of your contact
                                information so that any allegations of infringement or other wrongdoing may be directly resolved
