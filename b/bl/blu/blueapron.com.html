<p>
	We at Blue Apron, Inc. (“<u>Blue Apron</u>,” “<u>we</u>,” “<u>us</u>,” or “<u>our</u>”) have created this privacy policy (this “<u>Privacy Policy</u>”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of Blue Apron in connection with our online services (the “<u>Services</u>”), which are made available to you through a variety of platforms, including our website http://www.blueapron.com (the “<u>Website</u>”) and mobile application (collectively, the “<u>Platform</u>”).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	By visiting our Website, accessing the Platform, and/or using our Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use.&nbsp; Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>
	<strong>The Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>
	1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Personal Information</u></p>
<p>
	When you sign up to become a Subscriber, order a gift subscription, enter a contest, promotion, or sweepstakes, or sign up to receive our recipes, you will be required to provide us with personal information about yourself (collectively, the “<u>Personal Information</u>”).&nbsp; Such Personal Information for Subscribers may include your name, e-mail address, mailing address, and phone number.&nbsp; We do not collect any Personal Information from you when you use the Services unless you provide us with the Personal Information voluntarily. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	When you sign up to become a Subscriber or order a gift subscription, you will be required to provide certain information in addition to the Personal Information noted above.&nbsp; Such information may include a debit card number, credit card number, and similar information (collectively, the “<u>Billing Information</u>”).&nbsp; All transactions are processed by our third-party payment vendors.&nbsp; We do not collect, store, or maintain any Billing Information.&nbsp; Instead, it is collected and processed through these third-party vendors pursuant to the terms and conditions of their privacy policies and terms of use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<strong>The Information Collected by or Through Third-Party Advertising Companies</strong></p>
<p>
	We may share Other Information about your activity on the Platform with third parties for the purpose of tailoring, analyzing, managing, reporting, and optimizing advertising you see on the Platform and elsewhere.&nbsp; These third parties may use cookies, pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs), and/or other technologies to collect such Other Information for such purposes.&nbsp; Pixel tags enable us, and these third-party advertisers, to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits the site on which the pixel tag is located in order to learn which advertisement brings a user to a given site.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Accessing and Modifying Personal Information and Communication Preferences</strong></p>
<p>
	If you have registered for the Services, you may access, review, and make changes to your Personal Information and Billing Information by following the instructions found on the Platform.&nbsp; In addition, you may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of any Blue Apron marketing email.&nbsp; Subscribers cannot opt out of receiving transactional e-mails related to their account.&nbsp; We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a timely manner.&nbsp; You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our subscription databases.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How We Use and Share the Information&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
	We use the Personal Information, the Billing Information, and the Other Information to process transactions; provide you the Services; solicit your feedback; inform you about our products, services, upcoming events, recipes, and special promotions and those of our third-party marketing partners; administer and process contests, promotions, and sweepstakes; and improve our Services to you.&nbsp; Also, we may share Personal Information, the Billing Information, and/or Other Information as described below.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">
	·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.&nbsp; Examples include food services, delivery services, marketing assistance, information technology support, and customer service. &nbsp;These other companies will have access to the Personal Information, the Billing Information, and the Other Information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">
	·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to administer our contests, promotions, and sweepstakes, we may share your Personal Information and Other Information with our third-party promotional and marketing partners.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">
	·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an ongoing effort to better understand our users and our Services, we might analyze the Other Information in aggregate form in order to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Services. &nbsp;This aggregate information does not identify you personally. &nbsp;We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our products and Services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, or similar event, the Personal Information, the Billing Information, and the Other Information may be part of the transferred assets.</li>
	<li>
		To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose Personal Information, the Billing Information, and the Other Information when required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency, or whenever we believe that disclosing the such Information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of Blue Apron or others.&nbsp;</li>

<p>
	We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information, the Billing Information, and the Other Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. &nbsp;Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. &nbsp;We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Platform may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Important Notice to Non-U.S. Residents</strong></p>
<p>
	The Platform and the Services are operated in the United States.&nbsp; If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States.&nbsp; By using the Services and/or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer.&nbsp;</p>

	We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 through the Services. &nbsp;If you are under 13, please do not give us any Personal Information. &nbsp;We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide Personal Information through the Services without their permission. &nbsp;If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>
<p>
	<strong>External Websites</strong></p>
<p>
	The Platform may contain links to third-party websites.&nbsp; Blue Apron has no control over the privacy practices or the content of any of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors, or other websites to which we provide links.&nbsp; As such, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of those third-party websites.&nbsp; You should check the applicable third-party privacy policy and terms of use when visiting any other websites.</p>
