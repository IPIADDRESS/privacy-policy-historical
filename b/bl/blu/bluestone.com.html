		</p><p>Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your customer relationship with <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr>. On the ecardfile.com business card e-service, personal information you provide is considered publicly available  
		over the Internet, unless you choose otherwise in your ecardfile.com member profile. This statement is not  
		applicable to <a href="http://www.myapollo.com/"> www.myapollo.com</a> and <a href="http://www.dazel.com/"> www.dazel.com</a>,  
		which maintain their own Privacy Statements.

		</p><p>This statement regarding the privacy of the personally identifiable information you  
		provide online covers the five foundation principles of fair information: Awareness, Choice, Accuracy &amp; Access,  
		Security, and Oversight.
		</p><p>
		<b>Awareness</b>
		</p><p><abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr>  provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy policy, practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our  
		homepage and from the bottom of every HP.com, its subsidiaries' and affiliates' web pages.
		</p><p>
		<b>What we collect</b>
		</p><p>On some <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr>  web sites, you can order products or services, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are  
		name, contact and billing information, transaction, and credit card information. On  
		the ecardfile.com e-service, you supply the personal and business contact information you choose.
		</p><p>In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products, and more detailed contact preferences. Some electronic newsletters record anonymous data about articles you have expressed interest in.

		</p><p>Some HP.com web pages use cookies, a data analysis technique.  To learn more,  
		click here.  <a href="privacy.htm#cookies">How <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr>  uses cookies.</a>
		</p><p>
		<b>How we use it</b>
		</p><p><abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr>  uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a  
		transaction, to communicate back to you, to update you on service and benefits,  
		and to personalize our web sites for you. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing, fraud protection,  and are not retained for other purposes.
		</p><p>From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market  
		research or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular  
		interest.  At a minimum, we will always give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving  
		such direct marketing or market research contact.  We will also follow local requirements,  
		such as allowing you to opt in before receiving unsolicited contact, where applicable. On  
		the ecardfile.com e-service, information you supply and designate as public is available to any  
		viewer who looks up your card.  You can choose to keep most or all of your ecardfile.com information private. ecardfile.com is not a customer registration service. </p><p>
		<b>Who we share it with</b>
		</p><p><abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to others. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal data you provide online with other <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described in "how we use it". Such <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> entities and/or business partners, including those in the United States and/or any other countries, are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data and are bound by the appropriate confidentiality agreements.
		</p><p>Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide when you register your ownership of <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> products.</p><p> <b>Children's Privacy Protection</b> <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> takes special care to protect the privacy needs of children under the age of 13 and encourages parents to be an active participant in their child's online activities and interests. We abide by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requirements. The vast majority of <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> web sites do not target and are not intended for children under the age of 13. <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> web sites that do not target children will not knowingly collect data from them. If we discover personal data from a child through an adult oriented site, we will eliminate that data. A very few web sites in <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr>'s "Home &amp; Home Office" web section may include children under the age of 13 as part of a broader family audience target. Those specific web pages are clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice and processes to obtain parental approval, provide data access and data removal process for parents. <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> conducts the Annual <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> Young Writers' Contest from January to early April each year. This contest targets children under the age of 13, grades K-5. Personal data is not collected online. Data collected from children is done so through a printed contest entry form that is mailed or faxed to <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> care of the contest administrator SMP Scholastic. Parental approval is required on the contest entry form. No personal data is shared with the contest administrator. Parents wishing to access, review or delete their child's contest entry data should send a request to "Annual <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> Young Writers' Contest, SMP c/o Scholastic Inc., 555 Broadway, New York, NY 10012.</p><p>
		</p><p>
		<b>Choice</b>
		</p><p><abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first letting you know and offering you a choice. As previously stated, we will also provide you the opportunity  
		to let us know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited direct marketing materials from us  
		and we will do everything we can to honor such requests.   Local country laws and policies are  
		applied where they differ from those in the U.S.
		</p><p>Your permission is always secured first, should we ever share your information with  
		third parties that are not acting on our behalf and governed by our privacy policy.   
		For example, as part of <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr>'s commitment to offering you choice, we enable you to make online purchases directly from us or through our resellers. When you choose our  
		resellers, we inform you that your registration and shopping basket data is being  
		transferred to the reseller you selected.  This notice is important because when you  
		choose to make online purchases through our resellers, use of your registration and  
		shopping basket data by the reseller is then governed by their privacy policy.   
		Local country laws and policies are applied where they differ from those in the U.S.
		</p><p>
		<b>Accuracy &amp; Access </b>
		</p><p><abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr>  strives to keep your personally identifiable information accurate. We will provide you with access to your information, including making every effort to provide you with online access to your registration data so that you may view, update or correct your information at the <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> site where it was submitted. To  
		protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting  
		you access or enabling you to make corrections.  To access your personally identifiable information, return  
		to the web page where you originally entered it and follow the instructions on that web page.  To opt-out of <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> contact, provide your name, email and/or address and relevant information about subscriptions or registrations you may have with <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr>. This opt-out will cancel all marketing and support communication and newsletters, including software driver subscriptions.  Certain areas of <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr>'s web sites may limit access to specific individuals through the use of passwords and through providing personally data.

		</p><p>Links to third party web sites on the site are provided solely as a convenience to you.   
		If you use these links, you will leave the <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> site. <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> has not reviewed all of these third party sites and does not control and is not responsible for any of these sites, their content or their privacy policy. Thus, <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> does not endorse or make any representations about them, or any information, software or other products or materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from using them. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to this site, you  
		do so at your own risk.

		</p><p>
		<b>Security</b>
		</p><p><abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized  
		access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we  
		have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and  
		secure the information we collect online.  We use encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information. Preventing credit card fraud is important to protect your personal financial data security. As part of real-time payment processing, <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> subscribes to a Fraud Risk Management Service. The Service gives you and <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> an extra level of protection to guard against credit card fraud. The secure data transfer and validation process between the Service and <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> is bound by contractual and confidentiality agreements.

		<a name="cookies"><b>How <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> uses cookies</b></a>
		</p><p>A cookie is a piece of text asking permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive.  
		If you agree, then your browser adds the text in a small file. The purpose of a cookie is to help  
		us analyze web traffic or let us know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow a web  
		application to respond to you as an individual. By gathering and remembering information  
		about your preferences, the web application can tailor its operation to your needs, likes and  
		dislikes. For example, when you visit an electronic store, a cookie makes it easy to shop by allowing you to drop things into a shopping cart; the cart itself is not the cookie, the cookie is placed on your hard drive and keeps track of your cart versus others' in use at the same time. </p><p><abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> uses traffic log cookies to identify what pages are being used and which ones aren't. This helps  
		us aggregate and analyze data about web page traffic and make improvements to HP.com web sites  
		to better meet customer needs. In this case, <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> uses this information only for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system. That is the case of many of our support and  
		information-sharing pages and forums. Denial of a traffic log cookie should not prevent you from  
		using one of these sites.
		</p><p>A few HP.com web sites use temporary cookies as part of the customer web navigation experience,  
		tracking unique IDs for that particular web site session only. Examples are product registration sites. This cookie, by itself, only tells us that a previous HP.com visitor has returned.  
		If you deny the cookie, you can still use the site anonymously.  
		At <abbr title="hewlett-packard">hp</abbr>shopping.com, you will receive a persistent cookie. Customers can browse with cookies turned off, but you can only purchase if you accept the cookie. The <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> InfoAgent subscription service site requires enabling cookies to subscribe to the free newsletters offered through this service. <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> InfoAgent uses cookie technology to assign and place an identifier unique only to you, placed on your computer. When you register for the subscription service, it ensures that you are accurately identified and linked with your registration data. The InfoAgent also uses a temporary "authentication" cookie to assure secure access to your personal information by you alone (completed with user name and password).
		</p><p>Overall, cookies help us give you a better web site to use, by letting us monitor what's working and
