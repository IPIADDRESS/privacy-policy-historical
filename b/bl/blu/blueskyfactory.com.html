	    <h4><a name="spam"></a><b>Anti-Spam Policy</b><b> </b></h4>
	    <p>Blue Sky Factory is an electronic mail service provider  that provides web-based software enabling organizations of all sizes to send  permission-based emails to their subscribers. Blue Sky Factory believes,  practices, and requires our clients to practice only permission-based email  marketing. Our clients certify that they will only use our software to send  emails to customers and prospects that have directly consented to receive email  from them ("opt-in"). </p>
	  <p><strong>Permission Marketing Policy</strong> </p>
	  <p>Blue Sky Factory provides web-based  software enabling organizations of all sizes to send permission-based emails to  their subscribers. Blue Sky Factory believes in and practices only permission-based  email marketing. Our client members may only use our software to send emails to  customers and prospects that have agreed to receive email from them (opt-in),  and are forbidden to transmit unsolicited commercial email (spam) via our  system. </p>
	  <p><strong>Clients Agreement </strong> </p>
	  <p>Our clients agree not to use our  system to send unsolicited email. For any opt-in list of email addresses used  in our system, clients agree to provide Blue Sky Factory with the source of the  email addresses, the method used to capture the data, and verification of the  consent to receive emails from such client. We also encourage our members to  respect their customers' time and attention by controlling the frequency of  mailings to individual email addresses. Our clients certify that they will not  use rented or purchased lists, email append lists, or any other list that  contains email addresses captured in any other method than opt-in. The use of  Opt-out lists is prohibited in our system. Blue Sky Factory retains the right  to review client lists and emails to verify that clients are abiding by the  privacy and permission policies set forth herein. We will enforce our policy  without exception.&nbsp; However, our clients  are ultimately responsible for compliance with our policies. </p>
	  <p><strong>Why did you receive an email from our system? </strong> </p>
	  <p>If you received an email from us, it  is because one of our clients used the Blue Sky Factory software system to send  you an email. Our clients certify that all email addresses used in our system  are opt-in names that have given permission to the client to send them email.  We promise to keep your email address secure and private and will not use it  for other purposes. </p>
	  <p><strong>How do I get off an email list? </strong> </p>
	  <p>Each email sent through the Blue Sky  Factory system contains a link that allows subscribers to unsubscribe from  receiving emails from the sender. Each email sent contains an easy and  automated way for you to unsubscribe. If you have received an unwanted email  sent by the Blue Sky Factory system, please forward a copy of the email with  your comments to <a href="mailto:abuse@blueskyfactory.com">abuse@blueskyfactory.com</a></p>
	  <p><strong>Will your information ever be shared, sold or rented? </strong> </p>
	  <p>We will never share, sell, or rent  individual personal information without your explicit permission, unless ordered  by a court of law. Information submitted to us is only available to employees  responsible for managing this data. </p>
