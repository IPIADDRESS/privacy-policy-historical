  <strong>5. Cookies</strong> <br><br>
  We use "cookies" to  store specific information about you and track your visits to our Site. It is  not uncommon for web sites to use cookies to enhance identification of their  users.

  7.3 No data transmission over the  Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secured. <br><br>
