<strong class="copyHeader" style="text-transform: uppercase;">Boingo Wireless<sup>®</sup>, Inc. Privacy Policy</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="copy">
			
			<span class="copy">
			The privacy and security of your personal information is a foremost consideration of Boingo Wireless, Inc. We want to make your experience using the Boingo<sup>®</sup> service as enjoyable and rewarding 
			as possible while allowing you to feel secure that your privacy interests are being respected. 
			</span>
			
			
<br>
			
<br>
			
			
<b>Collection of Personal Information</b>
			
<br>

			
<br>
			
<span class="copyHeader">Required Information</span>
			
<br>

			
<br>
			
<span class="copy">
			Boingo collects certain information that is necessary to fully service your Boingo account. 
			As a customer, you will be asked to provide information that is needed in order to create your 
			Boingo account and fulfill our service commitment to you such as your name, address, phone number, 
			e-mails address and billing information. We treat this personal information that you provide to us 
			as highly confidential. Boingo may use this personal information for editorial and feedback 
			purposes, marketing and promotional purposes, for statistical analysis and for product development. 
			Your personal information, however, will never be sold to any company nor will it be shared with 
			third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. In instances 
			where Boingo and a partner jointly promote the Boingo service, Boingo may provide that partner 
			certain information, such as name and e-mail address, for the sole purpose of allowing Boingo and 
			the partner to evaluate the promotion.
			</span>
			
<br>
			
		

			
<br>
			
<span class="copyHeader">Optional Information</span>
			
<br>

			
<br>
			
<span class="copy">
			Boingo collects certain optional information that you may provide through the registration process. 
			This information is used to tailor our account services to most effectively serve you, and to 
			better understand the aggregate profile of our customers. This information may also be used in 
			developing new services. 
			<br>
			
<br>
			Like any business interested in attracting and offering the highest quality of service to customers, 
			Boingo gathers voluntary demographic information about our customers. These questions seek to gain 
			insight on such things as how an individual became aware of our service, their gender, occupation 
			and travel preferences and practices. In addition, customer comments and inquiries are collected 
			and stored for each customer that submits them. This information is collected and stored with the 
			customer's individual Boingo account information. This information is kept completely private and 
			confidential. 
			<br>
			
<br>
			Boingo occasionally conducts user surveys to better target our service offering to existing as well 
			as new customers. We sometimes share aggregated demographic information in these surveys with 
			business partners that offer complimentary offerings to the Boingo service. This information is 
			summarized, and information about specific individuals is never shared with any third party. 
			Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.
			<br>
			
<br>
			Boingo may offer incentive programs to customers, visitors to the Boingo Web site (www.boingo.com), 
			the general public and individuals identified through direct mail lists. These offerings are 
			promoted on the Web site, advertisements and press releases. At a minimum, required information 
			includes name and e-mail address; in some cases, the customer must answer mandatory survey questions 
			about other personal data or enter a program code. The information gathered in the entry form is 
			used to verify the entrant's identity, to send the entrant an e-mail notification that their entry 
			has been received, and to contact winners and/or prize recipients. Because the rules and terms of 
			each program can vary, all information about each program is clearly posted during the event. All 
			such programs are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and state laws.
			<br>
			
<br>
			
<a name="referral"></a>
			Boingo has and may institute referral programs or similar programs, such as the "Tell a Friend" program. Boingo's "Tell a Friend" program allows customers to receive credit for each individual (a "Referral") that, as a result of their recommendation, also becomes a customer. For a customer to receive a free month of service under this program, (1) the Referral must become a subscriber to Boingo Unlimited and remain a subscriber of either or Boingo Unlimited for more than 31 days; (2) the Referral cannot be an existing Boingo customer; and (3) the Referral cannot have been previously submitted to the "Tell a Friend" program by another person. Existing customers provide the e-mail address of the Referral, and Boingo may send an e-mail message to the Referral from the referring customer's e-mail address informing them of the Boingo service.

<br>
			
<span class="copyHeader">Tracking Information</span>
			
<br>

			
<span class="copy">
			
<br>
			Boingo may collect and/or track certain information that is derived from your usage of the Boingo 
			service such as usage patterns, travel patterns and Web site page views and traffic patterns. 
			Boingo may use this tracking information for statistical purposes to improve our products and 
			services and to manage our networks and systems more efficiently. To keep track of traffic on 
			their servers, Web sites often store a small data file on your hard disk when you visit them. 
			This file is commonly referred to as a "cookie."  A cookie file can contain user specific 
			information, such as User ID, or it can be used to maintain a connection with you during your visit 
			(so that you can visit pages of a site without retyping the same information over and over). 
			Boingo uses cookies to track customer traffic patterns, to maintain a connection during your visit with 
			us, to track your preferences, and to diagnose problems on our server and administer our site. 
			Cookies enable you to enter all parts of the Boingo Web site, and are used to save your User ID on 
			the login page (we encrypt the User ID for added security). In addition, cookie files help us 
			assist you with questions about site navigation, functionality or performance. Partners also may 
			use their own "cookies."  We do not control the use of our partners' cookies and expressly disclaim 
			responsibility for information collected through them.
			<br>
			
<br>
			Boingo also records the MAC (Media Access Controller) address from the network card in or used with 
			your computer or other device to enable Boingo to accurately perform our billing functions. 
			<br>

			
</span>
			
		
			
<br>
			
<b>Use of Information</b>
			
<br>

			
<span class="copy">
			
<br>
			Boingo will not divulge any of your personal information -- contact, financial, bill history -- to 
			any other organization unless (1) you give Boingo explicit, and specific, prior permission, (2) the 
			disclosure is required by law or by legal process authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction, 
			(3) Boingo suspects fraud by a customer involving Boingo, in which case Boingo may investigate and 
			report any evidence, including personally identifiable information, to law enforcement officials and 
			to the courts in the course of seeking remedies at law and equity and/or (4) you make an inquiry, 
			request or complaint that requires follow-up and we share your information with others to satisfy 
			your inquiry.
			<br>
			
<br>
			Boingo may contact customers or Web site visitors regarding account status and changes to this 
			privacy policy and any other policies or agreements relevant to Web site visitors. Boingo may use 
			your information to disclose summary information to strategic and business partners. This is 
			obtained by combining data from many individuals with the name and other identifiers removed. 
			Boingo also may create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns. This 
			information may be used to negotiate with service providers who complement the Boingo service or 
			assist us in our efforts to expand our customer base.
			<br>
			
<br>
			Boingo opposes the e-mailing of any junk mail, and does not sell customer information to e-mail lists 
			or telemarketers. If any of our partner sites engage in such practices, for any reason, Boingo 
			will immediately investigate, and if appropriate, discontinue services with such parties. If you 
			receive junk e-mail that mentions Boingo or its services, please send details to us at

<b>Correcting and Updating Your Information</b>
			
<br>

			
<span class="copy">
			
<br>
			As a Boingo customer, you are always fully in control of the information that we maintain to 
			service you. You can change your personal information at any time and as often as necessary. 
			You also can request that the data be deleted (requests for deletion of certain information may 
			require closing the account). Information about a customer may be withheld or exempted from 
			deletion if this is required by law, is part of a fraud investigation or is required for accounting 
			and audit purposes.
			<br>
			
</span>

		
			
<br>
			
<b>Opt-out Policy</b>
			
<br>

			
<span class="copy">
			
<br>
			Boingo provides its customers the opportunity to opt-in to providing Boingo with personal 
			information, as well a separate opportunity to opt-in to receiving communications from us and our 
			partners. At any time, customers can contact Boingo to opt-out of any of our promotions, programs 
			or contests. Alternatively, customers can opt not to provide certain personal information when 
			enrolling for the Boingo service or when participating in some programs and surveys, although 
			choosing not to provide certain information may hinder our ability to complete your registration 
			process.
			<br>
			
</span>

			
<br>
			
<b>Commitment to the Privacy of Your Family</b>
			
<br>

			
<span class="copy">
			
<br>
			Protecting the safety of minor children when they use the Internet is very important to us. It is 
			our policy to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and other applicable 
			laws. We recommend that children receive permission from a parent before gaining access to the 
			Boingo service or sending personal information to Boingo or anyone else online.
			<br>
			
</span>

			
<br>
			
<b>Security Measures</b>
			
<br>

			
<span class="copy">
			
<br>
			Your account information is kept confidential and secure via a unique User Identification number 
			and password that is issued to you. Your User ID and password should be kept confidential because 
			it is the key to accessing the information held by Boingo about you. If your computer or other 
			device is accessible to or by others, please log out of the Boingo site before you leave it. 
			Security is also provided through your web browser, which supports 40, 56 or a 128-bit version of 
			encryption with the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) security protocol. When you visit the Boingo Web 
			site, your personal account information is encrypted when transmitted across the Internet, using 
			the highest degree of security applicable.
			<br>
			
<br>
			Boingo has instituted internal safeguards to reduce the likelihood of accidental disclosures and 
			unintended access of customer information (although it is impossible to eliminate this possibility 
			completely). All employees, contractors and other companies engaged by Boingo are contractually 
			required, through signed, internal non-disclosure agreements, to keep customer information 
			confidential and not to use it in any way other than what is necessary to perform their work for 
			Boingo. Violations of these policies can result in termination in the case of employees, the 
			severing of contractual obligations in the case of contractors and other companies, and in civil 
			and criminal penalties if warranted and applicable by law. 
			<br>
