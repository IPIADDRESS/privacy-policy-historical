    Boingo Wireless<sup>®</sup>, Inc. Privacy Policy
  </strong></p>
  <p class="description">
    The privacy and security of your personal information is a foremost consideration of Boingo Wireless, Inc. We want to make your experience using the Boingo<sup>®</sup> service as enjoyable and rewarding as possible while allowing you to feel secure that your privacy interests are being respected. 
  </p>
  
    <div class="section">
      <p><strong class="copyHeader">
        Collection of Personal Information
      </strong></p>
      
        <div class="subSection">
          <p><strong class="copyHeader">Required Information</strong></p>
          Boingo collects certain information that is necessary to fully service your Boingo account. As a customer, you will be asked to provide information that is needed in order to create your Boingo account and fulfill our service commitment to you such as your name, address, phone number, e-mails address and billing information. We treat this personal information that you provide to us as highly confidential. Boingo may use this personal information for editorial and feedback purposes, marketing and promotional purposes, for statistical analysis and for product development. Your personal information, however, will never be sold to any company nor will it be shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. In instances where Boingo and a partner jointly promote the Boingo service, Boingo may provide that partner certain information, such as name and e-mail address, for the sole purpose of allowing Boingo and the partner to evaluate the promotion. 
        </div>
        <div class="subSection">
          <p><strong class="copyHeader">Optional Information</strong></p>
          <p>Boingo collects certain optional information that you may provide through the registration process. This information is used to tailor our account services to most effectively serve you, and to better understand the aggregate profile of our customers. This information may also be used in developing new services.</p> 
<p>Like any business interested in attracting and offering the highest quality of service to customers, Boingo gathers voluntary demographic information about our customers. These questions seek to gain insight on such things as how an individual became aware of our service, their gender, occupation and travel preferences and practices. In addition, customer comments and inquiries are collected and stored for each customer that submits them. This information is collected and stored with the customer's individual Boingo account information. This information is kept completely private and confidential. </p>  
<p>Boingo occasionally conducts user surveys to better target our service offering to existing as well as new customers. We sometimes share aggregated demographic information in these surveys with business partners that offer complimentary offerings to the Boingo service. This information is summarized, and information about specific individuals is never shared with any third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.</p>  

<p>Boingo may offer incentive programs to customers, visitors to the Boingo Web site (www.boingo.com), the general public and individuals identified through direct mail lists. These offerings are promoted on the Web site, advertisements and press releases. At a minimum, required information includes name and e-mail address; in some cases, the customer must answer mandatory survey questions about other personal data or enter a program code. The information gathered in the entry form is used to verify the entrant's identity, to send the entrant an e-mail notification that their entry has been received, and to contact winners and/or prize recipients. Because the rules and terms of each program can vary, all information about each program is clearly posted during the event. All such programs are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and state laws.</p>

<a name="referral"></a>
<p>Boingo has and may institute referral programs or similar programs, such as the "Tell a Friend" program. Boingo's "Tell a Friend" program allows customers to receive credit for each individual (a "Referral") that, as a result of their recommendation, also becomes a customer. For a customer to receive a free month of service under this program, (1) the Referral must become a subscriber to Boingo Unlimited and remain a subscriber of either or Boingo Unlimited for more than 31 days; (2) the Referral cannot be an existing Boingo customer; and (3) the Referral cannot have been previously submitted to the "Tell a Friend" program by another person. Existing customers provide the e-mail address of the Referral, and Boingo may send an e-mail message to the Referral from the referring customer's e-mail address informing them of the Boingo service.

        <div class="subSection">
          <p><strong class="copyHeader">Tracking Information</strong></p>
          <p>Boingo may collect and/or track certain information that is derived from your usage of the Boingo service such as usage patterns, travel patterns and Web site page views and traffic patterns. Boingo may use this tracking information for statistical purposes to improve our products and services and to manage our networks and systems more efficiently. To keep track of traffic on their servers, Web sites often store a small data file on your hard disk when you visit them. This file is commonly referred to as a "cookie."  A cookie file can contain user specific information, such as User ID, or it can be used to maintain a connection with you during your visit (so that you can visit pages of a site without retyping the same information over and over). Boingo uses cookies to track customer traffic patterns, to maintain a connection during your visit with us, to track your preferences, and to diagnose problems on our server and administer our site. Cookies enable you to enter all parts of the Boingo Web site, and are used to save your User ID on the login page (we encrypt the User ID for added security). In addition, cookie files help us assist you with questions about site navigation, functionality or performance. Partners also may use their own "cookies."  We do not control the use of our partners' cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them. </p>
<p>Boingo also records the MAC (Media Access Controller) address from the network card in or used with your computer or other device to enable Boingo to accurately perform our billing functions. </p>

        </div>
      
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p><strong class="copyHeader">Use of Information</strong></p>
      
        Boingo will not divulge any of your personal information -- contact, financial, bill history -- to any other organization unless (1) you give Boingo explicit, and specific, prior permission, (2) the disclosure is required by law or by legal process authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction, (3) Boingo suspects fraud by a customer involving Boingo, in which case Boingo may investigate and report any evidence, including personally identifiable information, to law enforcement officials and to the courts in the course of seeking remedies at law and equity and/or (4) you make an inquiry, request or complaint that requires follow-up and we share your information with others to satisfy your inquiry.
      
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p><strong class="copyHeader">Tracking Information</strong></p>
      
       
<p>Boingo may contact customers or Web site visitors regarding account status and changes to this privacy policy and any other policies or agreements relevant to Web site visitors. Boingo may use your information to disclose summary information to strategic and business partners. This is obtained by combining data from many individuals with the name and other identifiers removed. Boingo also may create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns. This information may be used to negotiate with service providers who complement the Boingo service or assist us in our efforts to expand our customer base.</p> 
<p>Boingo opposes the e-mailing of any junk mail, and does not sell customer information to e-mail lists or telemarketers. If any of our partner sites engage in such practices, for any reason, Boingo will immediately investigate, and if appropriate, discontinue services with such parties. If you receive junk e-mail that mentions Boingo or its services, please send details to us at <noscript><font color="#d90606">(You will need JavaScript enabled to view Boingo email addresses.)</font></noscript><script language="JavaScript">printEmail('Information');</script> and we will investigate promptly.</p>  
      
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p><strong class="copyHeader">Correcting and Updating Your Information</strong></p>
      <p>As a Boingo customer, you are always fully in control of the information that we maintain to service you. You can change your personal information at any time and as often as necessary. You also can request that the data be deleted (requests for deletion of certain information may require closing the account). Information about a customer may be withheld or exempted from deletion if this is required by law, is part of a fraud investigation or is required for accounting and audit purposes.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p><strong class="copyHeader">Opt-out Policy</strong></p>
      <p>Boingo provides its customers the opportunity to opt-in to providing Boingo with personal information, as well a separate opportunity to opt-in to receiving communications from us and our partners. At any time, customers can contact Boingo to opt-out of any of our promotions, programs or contests. Alternatively, customers can opt not to provide certain personal information when enrolling for the Boingo service or when participating in some programs and surveys, although choosing not to provide certain information may hinder our ability to complete your registration process.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p><strong class="copyHeader">Commitment to the Privacy of Your Family</strong></p>
      <p>Protecting the safety of minor children when they use the Internet is very important to us. It is our policy to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and other applicable laws. We recommend that children receive permission from a parent before gaining access to the Boingo service or sending personal information to Boingo or anyone else online.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p><strong class="copyHeader">Security Measures</strong></p>
      <p>Your account information is kept confidential and secure via a unique User Identification number and password that is issued to you. Your User ID and password should be kept confidential because it is the key to accessing the information held by Boingo about you. If your computer or other device is accessible to or by others, please log out of the Boingo site before you leave it. Security is also provided through your web browser, which supports 40, 56 or a 128-bit version of encryption with the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) security protocol. When you visit the Boingo Web site, your personal account information is encrypted when transmitted across the Internet, using the highest degree of security applicable.</p>
<p>Boingo has instituted internal safeguards to reduce the likelihood of accidental disclosures and unintended access of customer information (although it is impossible to eliminate this possibility completely). All employees, contractors and other companies engaged by Boingo are contractually required, through signed, internal non-disclosure agreements, to keep customer information confidential and not to use it in any way other than what is necessary to perform their work for Boingo. Violations of these policies can result in termination in the case of employees, the severing of contractual obligations in the case of contractors and other companies, and in civil and criminal penalties if warranted and applicable by law. </p>
