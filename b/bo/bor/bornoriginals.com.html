<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Analytics and advertising</h2>
<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
<p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service. It is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
<p>Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies". These are text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>
<p>Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
<h4>IP anonymization</h4>
<p>We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this website. Your IP address will be shortened by Google within the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to transmission to the United States. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services regarding website activity and Internet usage for the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with any other data held by Google.</p>
<h4>Browser plugin</h4>
<p>You can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. However, we wish to point out that doing so may mean you will not be able to enjoy the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent the data generated by cookies about your use of the website (incl. your IP address) from being passed to Google, and the processing of these data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.</p>
<h4>Objecting to the collection of data</h4>
<p>You can prevent the collection of your data by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link: <a href="javascript:gaOptout()">disable Google Analytics</a>. An opt-out cookie will be set to prevent your data from being collected on future visits to this site: Disable Google Analytics.</p>
<p>For more information about how Google Analytics handles user data, see Google's privacy policy: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en.</p>
<p>Outsourced data processing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have entered into an agreement with Google for the outsourcing of our data processing and fully implement the strict requirements of the German data protection authorities when using Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Demographic data collection by Google Analytics</p>
<p>This website uses Google Analytics' demographic features. This allows reports to be generated containing statements about the age, gender, and interests of site visitors. This data comes from interest-based advertising from Google and third-party visitor data. This collected data cannot be attributed to any specific individual person. You can disable this feature at any time by adjusting the ads settings in your Google account or you can forbid the collection of your data by Google Analytics as described in the section "Refusal of data collection".</p>
<h3>Google Analytics Remarketing</h3>
<p>Our websites use the features of Google Analytics Remarketing combined with the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and DoubleClick. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
<p>This feature makes it possible to link target audiences for promotional marketing created with Google Analytics Remarketing to the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. This allows advertising to be displayed based on your personal interests, identified based on your previous usage and surfing behavior on one device (e.g. your mobile phone), on other devices (such as a tablet or computer).</p>
<p>Once you have given your consent, Google will associate your web and app browsing history with your Google Account for this purpose. That way, any device that signs in to your Google Account can use the same personalized promotional messaging.</p>
<p>To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users that are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.</p>
<p>You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google Account; follow this link: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.</p>
<p>The aggregation of the data collected in your Google Account data is based solely on your consent, which you may give or withdraw from Google per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. For data collection operations not merged into your Google Account (for example, because you do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merge), the collection of data is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing anonymous user behavior for promotional purposes.</p>

<h3>Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking</h3>
<p>This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States ("Google").</p>
<p>As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking. When you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser stores on your computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user. Should the user visit certain pages of the website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell that the user clicked on the ad and proceeded to that page.</p>
<p>Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be tracked using the website of an AdWords advertiser. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for the AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, advertisers do not obtain any information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can opt-out of this by easily disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie by changing your browser settings. In doing so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>
<p>Conversion cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
<p>For more information about Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking, see the Google Privacy Policy: https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/.</p>
<p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p>
<h3>Facebook Pixel</h3>
<p>Our website measures conversions using visitor action pixels from Facebook, Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook").</p>
<p>These allow the behavior of site visitors to be tracked after they click on a Facebook ad to reach the provider's website. This allows an analysis of the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes and their future optimization.</p>
<p>The data collected is anonymous to us as operators of this website and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users' identities. However, the data are stored and processed by Facebook, which may make a connection to your Facebook profile and which may use the data for its own advertising purposes, as stipulated in the Facebook privacy policy. This will allow Facebook to display ads both on Facebook and on third-party sites. We have no control over how this data is used.</p>
<p>Check out Facebook's privacy policy to learn more about protecting your privacy: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.</p>
<p>You can also deactivate the custom audiences remarketing feature in the Ads Settings section at https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen. You will first need to log into Facebook.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Facebook account, you can opt out of usage-based advertising from Facebook on the website of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance: http://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/praferenzmanagement/.</p>

<h3>Hotjar</h3>
<p>We use the following Hotjar Ltd services: heat maps, visitor records, funnel charts and form analysis, feedback polls and surveys, and recruiters. Heatmaps show anonymously which elements of a website users click. Visitor records show users who actually use the site and summarize where they move their mouse pointer and what they click. All personal information is anonymized. Funnel charts can be used to see where we have lost most of our users. Form analysis shows us exactly where within a form, for example in which field, users stop entering information. They help identify fields that confuse visitors or raise concerns. With the feedback we receive, we can capture live feedback from users to our site. Feedback polls and surveys allow us to create pop-up polls and surveys about different web pages. We can create a series of questions and give users multiple pre-formulated answers to choose from, or set up a free text field. Recruiters allow us to ask visitors for their help directly on our pages. We can invite them to participate in a live user test via screen sharing (e.g. via Skype) so we can actually see how they use our sites and what they think. The information generated by the tracking code and cookie about your website use is transferred to Hotjar and stored on servers in Ireland. Hotjar uses this information to evaluate how you use the website, to compile website activity reports for website operators and to show website operators how users use the website and what feedback they give. Hotjar uses a number of services hosted by third parties, such as Google Analytics and Optimizely. These services may collect information that is sent by your browser as part of a request on a website, such as cookies or your IP request. For more information about how Google Analytics and Optimizely collect and use your information, please see their privacy policies, which can be found here and here respectively. The cookies used by Hotjar have different durations: some are valid for 365 days, others last only until the end of the session. You can click here for the opt-out option if you choose not to use Hotjar's services (as described above): https://www.hotjar.com/opt-out. A cookie will also be placed if you shrink a test user recruitment widget. This is to ensure that the widget remains minimized while you are browsing our site.&nbsp;</p>
