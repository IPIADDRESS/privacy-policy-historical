<font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">
Experimental and Applied Sciences, Inc. (EAS) has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our commitment to the privacy and security of information concerning our customers and visitors to our Web site. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for BodyforLIFE.com™. Using our Web site affirms your consent to the collection and use of information pursuant to EAS' disclosures in this policy statement.<br><br>

<b>What information does BodyforLIFE.com collect about its visitors?</b><br><br>

We use aggregate Web site log information to measure popularity, traffic, effectiveness of various areas of this Web site, and the overall performance of this site. This log information is collected through the use of a cookie, but it is not personally identifying. If a visitor comes to our Web site from a banner ad, we use a cookie to monitor the advertisement tracking code that identifies from which banner ad the customer came. This information is used in determining the effectiveness of our Internet advertising campaigns.<br><br>

EAS offers a number of services to our Web site visitors. The type of service of which you want to take advantage will determine the type of information required. In some cases you can choose how much information to supply, but there may be circumstances where we require complete information in order to provide a service for you or fulfill your request. For example, if you want to register for an event, we will require your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address in order to process your request. If you decide to participate in a voluntary promotional survey, we may ask for information about such matters as your buying habits and preferences.<br><br>

Event questionnaires may also be available for completion online. You could be asked for your name, address, telephone number, and personal physical information such as your bodyfat percentage, height, weight, and fitness goals. Additional questions may include what type of supplements you've used in the past and whether or not you've previously competed in one of our Transformation Challenge events.<br><br>

<b>What does EAS do with the information collected from Web site visitors?</b><br><br>

EAS will use your personal information to fulfill your information or product requests. EAS may also share your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address with unaffiliated third parties that have goods or services that may interest you. If you would prefer we do not share your information with anyone, please notify us by sending an e-mail message to <a href="mailto:privacy@bodyforlife.com">privacy@bodyforlife.com</a>. We will honor your request with the exception of providing information to law enforcement authorities or other government entities if required to do so by law, or if EAS believes it to be appropriate to protect or defend the rights or property of EAS.<br><br>

Personal information provided through questionnaires or promotional surveys is used in the internal company administration of those events. EAS may also use this questionnaire or survey information in aggregate form to facilitate the development of products and services that allow us to better support our customers in meeting their fitness goals.<br><br>

<b>What is a cookie?</b><br><br>

Cookies can store information from a database, custom page settings, or just about anything that would make a site individualized and customizable.
