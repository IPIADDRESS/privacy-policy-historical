  <h3> PRIVACY POLICY - COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY</h3>
  <p>This site is owned and operated by Body Ecology, Inc. Your privacy on the Internet 
    is of the utmost importance to us. At Body Ecology, we want to make your experience 
    online satisfying and safe.</p>
  <p>Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you 
    should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding 
    the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses 
    what information we gather and how we use it.</p>
  <p><b>INFORMATION BODY ECOLOGY GATHERS AND TRACKS</b></p>
  <p>Body Ecology gathers two types of information about users:</p>
  <p>Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These 
    are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate 
    in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation 
    in polls and surveys:</p>
  <p><br>
    Information Body Ecology gathers through aggregated tracking information derived 
    mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows 
    us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers 
    and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because Body 
    Ecologyderives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing 
    such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free 
    to users. Under no circumstances does Body Ecology divulge any information 
    about an individual user to a third party. <br>
    Body Ecology Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:</p>
  <p><b>Optional Voluntary Information</b></p>
  <p>We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary 
    submission of personal information by users:</p>
  <p>1. Electronic newsletters policy (Dispatches)</p>
  <p>We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. Body Ecology gathers 
    the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves 
    from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter 
    that points users to the subscription management page.</p>
  <p>2. Message boards/forums policy</p>
  <p>Users of the site's Message Boards and Forums must register separately for 
    these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages, although 
    they needn't register to visit the site. During registration the user is required 
    to supply a username, password, and email address.</p>
  <p>3. "E-mail this to a friend" policy</p>
  <p>Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents 
    to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user 
    must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information 
    is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the 
    recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other 
    purpose.</p>
  <p>4. Polling</p>
  <p>We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions 
    with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. 
    Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable 
    to any particular user. Body Ecology may use a system to "tag" users 
    after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. 
    This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.</p>
  <p>5. Surveys</p>
  <p>Body Ecology may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content 
    to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information 
    in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share 
    any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.</p>
  <p><b>Children</b></p>
  <p>Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 
    (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information 
    from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.</p>
  <p><b>Usage tracking</b></p>
  <p>Body Ecology tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, 
    we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. Body 
    Ecology does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain 
    name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser 
    string (information contained in every user's browser).</p>
  <p>Body Ecology sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter 
    in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual 
    users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users 
    like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what 
    individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This 
    helps us continue to build a better service for you.</p>
  <p><b>Cookies</b></p>
  <p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files 
    of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information 
    although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information 
    that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information 
    a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read 
    data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Body 
    Ecology uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). 
    Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions 
    and click rates.</p>
  <p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set 
    your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning 
    message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use 
    this site. However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message 
    boards, forums, polling and surveys.</p>
  <p><b>USE OF INFORMATION</b></p>
  <p>Body Ecology uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance 
    their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or 
    personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based 
    on the interests of our users.</p>
  <p>As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order 
    to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, 
    surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers 
    on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send 
    out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested 
    in something we are doing. Body Ecology never shares newsletter mailing lists 
    with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.</p>
  <p>When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users 
    like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what 
    individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This 
    helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms 
    entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. 
    But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.</p>
  <p>Body Ecology creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns 
    for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise 
    more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are 
    pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual 
    users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked 
    their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except 
    to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal 
    safety of our users or the public.</p>
  <p><b>SHARING OF THE INFORMATION</b></p>
  <p>Body Ecology uses the above-described information to tailor our content to 
    suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's 
    demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. We will not share 
    information about individual users with any third party, except to comply 
    with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety 
    of our users or the public.</p>
  <p><b>SECURITY</b></p>
  <p>Body Ecology operates secure data networks protected by industry standard 
    firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies 
    are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals 
    have access to the information provided by our customers.</p>
  <p><b>OPT-OUT POLICY</b></p>
  <p>We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:</p>
  <p>Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters.</p>
  <p> Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely 
    alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information from 
    our users.</p>
  <p>
    <b>YOUR CONSENT</b></p>
  <p>By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information 
    by Body Ecology. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those 
    changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, 
    how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
