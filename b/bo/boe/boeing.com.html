<center> <p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BOEING.COM 
- GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY</font></b> </p><p align="left">Thank you for reviewing the 
Privacy Policy for Boeing.com, your web portal into The Boeing Company ("Boeing"). 
Boeing is sensitive to the issue of confidentiality in online dealings and is 
committed to protecting individual privacy. This Privacy Policy is intended to 
inform users about the general approach Boeing uses in collecting, using and disseminating 
user information via Boeing.com. </p><p align="left"><b>What data do we collect automatically 
and why?</b> When you visit Boeing.com and you have not otherwise identified yourself 
(e.g., via registration with a Boeing Site), our web server automatically recognizes 
your domain name, but not your e-mail address. We collect the domain name and 
monitor general site use and traffic patterns to improve our web site and the 
products and services we offer. Boeing uses web server logs to collect data for 
metric purposes. Examples of the types of data collected on the logs are IP addresses, 
referral pages, date and time of Site access, and Site visited. We may use collected 
data to customize the content and/or layout of our pages for each individual visitor. 
</p><p align="left"> <b>Do we use Cookies or Tracers?</b> Cookies are small data files 
placed on your hard drive by a website server when you visit. Boeing.com may use 
cookies for tracking purposes or to make the Site easier to use. Cookies are currently 
the only way to effectively identify a unique anonymous visitor and understand 
how they navigate our web site. An anonymous visitor to our site remains anonymous 
in all cases. We do not attempt to identify visitors if they do not voluntarily 
submit personal information to us. With most internet browsers, you can erase 
cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning 
before a cookie is stored. Cookies offer enhanced functionality to the user, but 
whether you allow a cookie to be placed on your computer is up to you! <br><br>In 
some instances, we use tracking scripts or "tracers" that recognize a unique identifier 
from a cookie placed on your hard drive by another website. These are used by 
Boeing solely to gauge the success of our own advertising. For instance, we may 
use a tracer to determine whether you visit our employment pages after visiting 
a resume or career site where Boeing placed a banner ad. We do not use tracers 
to gather information on your use of the internet unrelated to Boeing. Please 
note that Boeing does not use tracers to identify your personal information, and 
you remain anonymous unless and until you choose to register.<br><br></p><p align="left"><b>Do 
we collect personal information?</b> In some cases, Boeing requests personally 
identifiable information from you in order to satisfy the underlying transaction 
or purpose of your accessing the Site. Examples of personally identifiable information 
include names, e-mail addresses, mailing addresses, and the like. Please note 
that we do not consider aggregated information, from which personally identifiable 
information has been removed, to be private. </p><p align="left"><b>What happens if 
I register?</b> Registration is allowed or required on certain Boeing Sites. Please 
refer to the agreements and policies applicable to the Boeing Site for which you 
provide registration information in order to assure that you understand the applicable 
privacy practices. Boeing may collect registration data in order to monitor compliance 
with the terms of use governing the Site and to set up access permissions to certain 
Boeing Sites. </p><p align="left"><b>What security is provided?</b> We do not treat 
your general interaction with Boeing.com (e.g., submission of suggestions) as 
confidential. However, certain Boeing Sites do conduct transactions for which 
heightened security is appropriate. For instance, certain Boeing Sites encrypt 
your personal information (e.g., for transmission of credit card data), so that 
only appropriate personnel are able to decode your information. Note that most 
internet browsers also offer security alerts that permit you to determine whether 
your transmissions are protected. Please refer to the agreements and policies 
applicable to the Boeing Site for which you provide personal information in order 
to assure that you understand applicable security practices. </p><p align="left"><b>When 
would we disclose your information?</b> We do not rent, sell, or trade any personally 
identifiable information about you (e.g., e-mail addresses) to third parties. 
Certain Boeing Sites may disclose information to third parties assisting us in 
processing a transaction requested by you (e.g., credit card service providers). 
In order to cooperate with legitimate governmental requests, subpoenas, or court 
orders, to protect Boeing and/or Boeing's systems and customers, or to ensure 
the integrity and operation of Boeing and/or Boeing's business and systems, Boeing 
and/or Boeing may access and disclose any information it considers necessary or 
appropriate under the circumstances. </p><p align="left"><b>What about children's 
privacy?</b> Boeing asks children under 13 not to transmit any information to 
the Site. Boeing welcomes the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 
to use the Site and provide any information, service, or product gained from the 
Site to their child. The Kids page found on Boeing.com does not gather identifiable 
personal information and is operated as a static Site for informational purposes 
only. </p><p align="left"><b>What if data is transmitted internationally?</b> If you 
are one of our international guests, we realize that you may want to know whether 
your personal information will be transferred out of your country of origin. Please 
be aware that when you register or request a transaction on a Boeing Site, your 
personal data may be transferred to computers in the United States in order to 
process your request. </p><p align="left"><b>Does this apply to all of the Boeing 
Sites?</b> Through Boeing.com, you may link to many networked web pages and websites 
operated by Boeing and its subsidiaries and affiliates (together, the "Boeing 
Sites"). Not all of them have adopted this policy. Individual Boeing Sites may 
adopt different privacy policies that fit transactions taking place on that Boeing 
Site. If a Boeing Site has its own privacy policy, the provisions of that policy 
will control if it conflicts with this general policy. Also, some Boeing Sites 
are intended to facilitate interaction with other businesses, and may not adopt 
a privacy policy for individuals. Users of those Sites should check with their 
employer regarding the employer's arrangements with Boeing and applicable privacy 
practices. </p><p align="left"><b>What about external links?</b> For the convenience 
of our Site visitors, Boeing may provide links to third party web sites that are 
external to Boeing. These web sites are not operated or controlled by Boeing, 
and Boeing is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such 
external web sites. </p><p align="left"><b>How do we keep current?</b> From time to 
time, Boeing may revise this Privacy Policy at its discretion. We note the date 
of the policy below, so you know when it was last updated. Boeing advises you 
to check back periodically to review the Privacy Policy because users of the Site 
will be prospectively bound by the then-current version of this Privacy Policy.
