</p><h1>Boxee Privacy Policy</h1><p></p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><a name="_GoBack"></a>This
Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Boxee, Inc.
(“Boxee”, “we” or “us”) on the collection, use and
disclosure of information collected by Boxee on http://www.boxee.tv/
(together with any subdomains or related pages, the “Site”) or in
connection with Boxee’s media platform that permits end users to
manage and view digital content downloaded or streamed through the
internet (including all related services, features, content,
applications or widgets offered by Boxee, the “Boxee Platform”
and, collectively with the site, the “Service”).  In connection
with your use of the Service, we receive information about you from
various sources, including: (i) through your account as a user of the
Boxee Platform (your “Account”) and (ii) through your use of the
Site and the Service generally.  When you use the Service, you are
consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage,
transmission, disclosure and other uses of your information as
described in this Privacy Policy.  
</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>What does this
Privacy Policy Cover?  What is not covered by this Privacy Policy?</b></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">This
Privacy Policy covers the collection and treatment of information,
including personally identifiable information (“Personal
Information”), by Boxee through the Service.  This Privacy Policy
also covers our treatment of information that our business partners
share with us or that we share with our business partners.   
</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>This
Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that
we do not own or control, including, but not limited to, any third
party websites, content sources, services and applications (“Third
Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Service.
Please note that most applications accessed via the Boxee Platform
are provided by third parties and accordingly, the collection and
treatment of information within such applications is governed by the
privacy policies of such third parties.</b>  <b>While we attempt to
facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our
respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the
content or privacy policies of those third party services.  We
strongly encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of
all Third Party Services.</b></p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>What
Information Is Collected by Boxee?</b></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The
information we gather enables us to personalize your experience
within the Boxee Platform, and to continually improve and operate the
Service.  In connection with certain aspects of the Service, we may
request, collect and/or display certain information from our users.
We collect the following types of information from our users:</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>Account
</b><b>Information:</b><b>
</b>
</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">When
you create an Account or login, you will provide information that
could be Personal Information, such as your name, address, username,
password and email address.  You acknowledge that this information
may be personal to you, and by creating an account with Boxee and
providing Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us,
to identify you and therefore you may not be anonymous.  We may use
your contact information to provide information to you regarding your
Account, and we may also send you promotional emails relating to the
Boxee Platform that inform you of certain new developments and the
applications and services available to you.  You may unsubscribe from
promotional messages through your Account settings, however, we
reserve the right to contact you when we believe it is necessary to
provide the Service to you.  We may receive a confirmation when you
open an email from us.  We use this confirmation to improve our
customer service.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">If
you purchase content through the Boxee Platform, you may elect to
have Boxee store your credit card information for your ease of use in
making further purchases.  Unless you elect for Boxee to store credit
card information, Boxee uses, collects and stores your credit card
information only for the purpose completing each specific
transaction.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>Profile
Page:</b></p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">We
will display your Personal Information in your profile page and
elsewhere on the Sites according to the preferences you set in your
Account. Any information you choose to provide should reflect how
much you want other Boxee users to know about you. We recommend that
you guard your anonymity and sensitive information, and we encourage
users to think carefully about what information about themselves they
disclose in their profile pages. You can review and revise your
profile information at any time.</p>
<p style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>User
Activity and Sharing:</b></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">We
collect and store information regarding your use of the Boxee
Platform, including (i) the content viewed, (ii) the time and date of
each viewing, (iii) the application used in viewing the content and
(iv) IP addresses, including internal IP addresses, of devices
accessing the Boxee Platform.  We also retain your browsing history
on the Site for fourteen (14) days, including the identity and
address of the pages you view via the Site.  If you choose to link
your Account to Facebook, Twitter, or any other social media service,
we may collect and store information relating to any content that you
share through the Boxee Platform with friends as well as information
relating to your friends and any media files shared by your friends
on the social media service.  
</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The
Boxee Platform also includes a feature that allows you to search
Boxee’s system for metadata relating to your local files.  We do
not collect or retain any information relating to such searches,
however, if you view a local file for which a related metadata file
has been provided from the Service, we may collect and store
information on the time and date on which you viewed the local file.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">We
use all of this information to optimize your experience within the
Boxee Platform, and to improve and optimize the Boxee Platform
generally.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>Third
Party Services:</b></p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">If
you have accounts directly with third parties for certain Third Party
Services available on the Boxee Platform (e.g. Netflix, Pandora,
etc.), you may elect to have Boxee store your account information for
such Third Party Services (“Third Party Account Information”).
In such event, we use this information only for your ease of use in
connecting to the Third Party Services through the Boxee Platform.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>IP
Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:</b></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">We
automatically receive and record information from the Service or your
web browser when you interact with the Service, including your IP
address and cookie information.  This information is used to
facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the
Service as described in this policy.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Generally,
Boxee automatically collects usage information, such as the number
and frequency of users accessing the Service and various channels of
content.  We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a
statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you
personally.  This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties
authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the
Service so that we can analyze and improve the Service.  
</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>Information
Collected Using Cookies:</b></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Cookies
are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your
web browser or application when you access a website or service.
Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website
or service you visit.  We use cookies to enable our servers to
recognize your web browser or the Service and tell us how and when
you visit and use the Service through the web or through an
application.  
</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Cookies
also allow us to track when you have accessed content through the
Service.  Each access may be tracked using a unique identifier
assigned to you in one or more cookies stored by your web browser or
application and associated with Boxee.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Boxee
cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we
do not combine the general information collected through cookies with
Personal Information you have provided to us.  As noted, however, we
do use cookies to identify that your web browser or application has
accessed content through the Service and may associate that
information with your Account if you have one.  
</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">This
Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the
use of cookies by third parties.  We do not control when or how third
parties place cookies on your computer or device.  For example, Third
Party Services may set their own cookies.  
</p>
<p style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>Aggregate
Information:</b></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">We
may combine certain information that we collect from you with
information collected from other users in an aggregate,
non-personally identifiable format (“Aggregate Information”).
Some of this information is derived from Personal Information, such
as your location (which, in turn, can be derived from your IP address
or through location based services used by your device).  Aggregate
Information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to
you or your Account.  If you delete your Account, information
pertaining to your Account activity is retained as a part of the
Aggregate Information; however there will be no association between
this information and your Account.  We use Aggregate Information to
gain insight into our users’ use of the Service generally, and to
optimize and improve the Service.  We may also share Aggregate
Information with our third party partners, who use such information
for the purpose of optimizing and improving the Third Party Services.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0.02in; margin-bottom: 0.02in; page-break-after: avoid">
<span lang="en"><b>Our
Policy Toward Children:</b></span></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0.02in; margin-bottom: 0.02in">

<span lang="en">The
Service is available only to individuals who are at least 13 years
old.  We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children
under 13.  If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her
child has provided us with Personal Information without parental
consent, he or she should contact us at </span><a href="mailto:privacy@boxee.tv"><span lang="en">privacy@boxee.tv</span></a><span lang="en">.
 If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with
Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.</span></p>


<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>How and To Whom
Is My Information Shared?</b></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Except
for use of your Personal Information in connection with and to
optimize your experience with the Service, we use your Personal
Information for the purpose of providing the Service to you only.  We
do not and will not sell, rent, distribute or otherwise provide your
information to third parties, except as provided below.  We consider
your privacy to be of utmost importance.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>Third
Party Services:</b></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Please
remember that if you choose to connect to Third Party Services
through the Service (including through third party applications on
the Boxee Platform), any information you provide within such Third
Party Services is being provided directly to such third parties and
is governed by such third parties’ privacy policies.  We encourage
you to understand the privacy policies of such third parties prior to
providing Personal Information to any Third Party Services, and to
think carefully about what information you choose to share.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>IP
Address Information:</b></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">While
we collect and store IP address information, that information is not
made public.  We do at times, however, share this information with
our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we
conduct business.  We may share hashes of your IP address with other
third parties, but these hashes cannot feasibly be reversed into the
IP addresses themselves or linked to you individually.  
</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>Information
You Elect to Share:</b></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">As
mentioned above, you may elect to share certain content you access on
the Boxee Platform with your friends through Facebook, Twitter or
other social media services, and in doing so certain profile
information will be displayed to those with whom you share content.
In addition, we will display your Personal Information in your
profile page and elsewhere on the Sites according to the preferences
you set in your Account.  You can control the
information that is shared through your Account settings.
</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>Aggregate
Information:</b></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">We
share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and
other persons with whom we conduct business.  We share this type of
statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how
often people use Boxee and their services or websites, which
facilitates improving both their services and how we interface with
them.  In addition, these third parties may share with us
non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about
you that they have independently developed or acquired.</p>
<p style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>Information
Shared with Our Agents</b><b>: </b>
</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">We
employ and contract with people and other entities that perform
certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our
“Agents”).  We may need to share Personal Information with our
Agents in order to provide the Service to you.  Unless we tell you
differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal
Information or other information we share with them beyond what is
necessary to assist us in providing the Service to you.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>Information
Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers: </b>
</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">In
some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.  In these types of
transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred
business assets.  Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets
associated with Boxee, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that
we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be
one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer
of us may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in
this policy.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>Information
Disclosed for the Protection of Us and Others: </b>
</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">We
also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any
information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any
applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request,
(ii) enforce Boxee’s Terms of Use (available at
<a href="http://www.boxee.tv/tou">http://www.boxee.tv/tou</a> or a
successor URL), including investigation of potential violations
thereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security
or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v)
protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public.
This includes exchanging information with other companies and
organizations for fraud protection and spam prevention.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>Information
We Share With Your Consent: </b>

</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Except
as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal
Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to
prevent the sharing of this information.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>Is Information
About Me Secure? </b>
</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">We
protect your Personal Information, Account information and Third
Party Account Information using industry-standard security
techniques.  While we endeavor to protect such information to ensure
that it is kept private, we cannot guarantee the security of any
information.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software
failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user
information at any time.  Therefore, we do not guarantee or warrant
that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information
about you we store, Personal Information or otherwise.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">You
should do your part to prevent unauthorized access to your Account
and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password
appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by
signing off after you have finished accessing your Account.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>How
Can I Delete My Account? </b>
</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Should
you ever decide to delete your Account, you may do so by altering
your Account settings.  If you terminate and delete your Account, any
association between your Account and information stored by and in
connection with Boxee will no longer be accessible.  However, any
information collected by Boxee prior to deletion of your Account will
continue to be stored by Boxee in an aggregate, non-personally
identifiable manner.  
</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><b>What
Choices Do I Have Regarding My Information?</b></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">As
stated previously, you can opt not to disclose certain information to
us; however, you may be required to share certain information in
order to take advantage of some Boxee features.  If you do not wish
to disclose any information to us, you can delete your Account and
discontinue using the Service.  
</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid">
<b>What
Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?</b></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">We
may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time.  Use of information
we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time
such information is used.  If we make changes in the way we collect
or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on
or within the Service or sending you an email.  A user is bound by
any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses Boxee after
such changes have been first posted, so we encourage you to review
this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>What
If I Have Questions or Concerns? </b>
</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">If
you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using Boxee,
please send us a detailed message to:<span lang="en">

 We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.</p>
