<p align="justify"><b><u>Privacy Statement for <i>Box Office Mojo</i></u></b><br><i>Box Office Mojo</i> has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of our members and Web site visitors. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: <i>Box Office Mojo</i>. </p>

<p align="justify">We may collect your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number or other personal information from you, however, the information that we collect depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. You can visit many pages on our site without providing any information. Other pages may prompt you to provide information, such as when you register for access to portions of our site, sign up for an account, participate in polls, provide feedback, participate in discussion forums or request interactive features that are present on our site. <b>Do not provide false information to access any portion of our site</b>. </p>

<p align="justify">With regards to information that you choose to provide on our site, we encourage you to be careful and responsible. Should you choose to voluntarily disclose any personal information on our site be aware that such information may be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties.

<p align="justify">We also collect information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to you. We may log the name of your Internet Service Provider, IP address, or use "cookie" technology to assist us with enhancing your experience on our site, including but not limited to troubleshooting our Web site or server (which may require third party technical support), site administration, using cookies to store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or to control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but be aware that doing so may limit your ability to access certain portions of the site or may require you to re-enter your user name and password.

<p align="justify"><b><u>Children</u></b><br>We comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which requires the consent of a parent or guardian for the collection of personally identifiable information from children under 13.

<p align="justify"><b><u>Changes to This Policy</u></b><br>We reserve the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.
