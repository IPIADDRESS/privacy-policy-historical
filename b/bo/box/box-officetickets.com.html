<p><strong>With Whom the Information May Be Shared</strong><br>Information  we collect may be accessed by a variety of parties, depending upon the  project for which the information was originally collected, the terms of  that engagement, and the policies into or out of which the consumer has  opted. From time to time, we may send you offers from Box Office  Tickets, its affiliated properties, and our promotional partners based  on the information you have provided us. In addition, we may provide  information we collect about you with third party companies regarding  promotions, sweepstakes and other opportunities/offers. These third  parties are subject to stringent data security and confidentiality  requirements and, upon completion of their fulfillment services, all  information is returned to Box Office Tickets or is destroyed.While  we believe this disclosure of your information will result in  opportunities that may be of interest to you, you have the right to tell  us not to give your information to any third party. If you want Box  Office Tickets to keep all of your information we have collected  confidential and not share it with any third party, please submit a  written request to email address:&nbsp;<strong><em><a href="mailto:sales@eventticketsales.info">sales@eventticketsales.info</a>.</em></strong>Your  request must include your name, email address, and mailing address.
