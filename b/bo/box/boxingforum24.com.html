<div align="left">
  <p>Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At boxingforum24.com, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.</p>
  <p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click here</a> </p>
  <p><b>INFORMATION WE GATHER AND TRACK<br>
    </b><br>
  boxingforum24.com gathers two types of information about users:</p>
  <p>· Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys:</p>
  <p>· Information we gathes through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because boxingforum24.com derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users. Under no circumstances does boxingforum24.com divulge any information about an individual user to a third party.</p>
  <p>boxingforum24.com Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:</p>
  <p><b>Optional Voluntary Information</b><br>
      <br>
    We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:</p>
  <p>1. Electronic newsletters (Dispatches)<br>
    We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. boxingforum24.com gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration. </p>
  <p>2. Message boards/forums<br>
    Users of the site's Message Boards and Forums must register separately for these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages, although they needn't register to visit the site. During registration the user is required to supply a username, password, and email address.</p>
  <p>3. "E-mail this to a friend" Service<br>
    Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.</p>
  <p>4. Polling<br>
    We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. boxingforum24.com may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.</p>
  <p>5. Surveys<br>
    boxingforum24.com may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.<br>
  </p>
  <p><b>Children</b><br>
      <br>
    Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.<br>
  </p>
  <p><b>Usage tracking</b><br>
      <br>
    boxingforum24.com tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. boxingforum24.com does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).<br>
    boxingforum24.com sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.<br>
