<br><br>
<h4 id="web-beacons">WEB BEACONS</h4>
We may also use a technology called web beacons to collect general information about your use of our website and your use of special promotions or newsletters. The information we collect by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor the number of people who open our emails. Web beacons also help us to understand the behavior of our customers, members, and visitors.
<br><br>
<h4 id="google-analytics-privacy-notice">GOOGLE ANALYTICS PRIVACY NOTICE</h4>
Our website uses Google Analytics to collect information about the use of our website. Google Analytics collects information from users such as age, gender, interests, demographics, how often they visit our website, what pages they visit, and what other websites they have used before coming to our website. We use the information we get from Google Analytics to analyze traffic, remarket our products and services to users, improve our marketing, advertising, and to improve our website. We have enabled Google Analytics advertising features such as remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit our website, not your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected using Google Analytics with Personal Data. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our website, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google also uses specific identifiers to help collect information about the use of our website. For more information on how Google collects and processes your data, <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">visit this link</a>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<h4>Embedded content from other websites</h4>
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
<br><br>
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
<br><br>
<h4>YouTube</h4>
Our website uses plugins from YouTube, which is operated by Google. The operator of the pages is YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.
<br><br>
If you visit one of our pages featuring a YouTube plugin, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. Here the YouTube server is informed about which of our pages you have visited.
<br><br>
If you’re logged in to your YouTube account, YouTube allows you to associate your browsing behavior directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.
<br><br>
YouTube is used to help make our website appealing. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
<br><br>
Further information about handling user data, can be found in the data protection declaration of YouTube under
<a class="externalURL" href="https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy</a>.
<br><br>
<h4>Google Web Fonts</h4>
For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.
<br><br>
When you call up a page of our website that contains a social plugin, your browser makes a direct connection with Google servers. Google thus becomes aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
<br><br>
If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your computer.
<br><br>
Further information about handling user data,
can be found at
<a class="externalURL" href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">developers.google.com/fonts/faq</a>

<h4>Google reCAPTCHA</h4>
We use “Google reCAPTCHA” (hereinafter “reCAPTCHA”) on our websites. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”).
<br><br>
reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to Google.
<br><br>
The reCAPTCHA analyses take place completely in the background. Website visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place.
<br><br>
Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam.
<br><br>
More information about <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Google reCAPTCHA and Google’s privacy policy</a>
<h4>Google Maps</h4>
This site uses the Google Maps map service via an API. It is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
<br><br>
To use Google Maps, it is necessary to save your IP address. This information is generally transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The provider of this site has no influence on this data transfer.
<br><br>
The use of Google Maps is in the interest of making our website appealing and to facilitate the location of places specified by us on the website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
<br><br>
Further information about handling user data, can be found in the data protection declaration of Google at
<a class="externalURL" href="https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/</a>.
<br><br>
<h4 id="how-your-information-is-used">HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS USED</h4>
We use the information we receive from you to:
<ul>
<li>Personalize and customize our content</li>
<li>Make improvements to our website</li>
<li>Contact you with updates to our website</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="communications-and-emails">EMAIL NEWSLETTERS</h4>
If you would like to receive our newsletter, we require a valid email address as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and that you agree to receive this newsletter. No additional data is collected or is only collected on a voluntary basis. We only use this data to send the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.
<br><br>
We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. You can revoke consent to the storage of your data and email address as well as their use for sending the newsletter at any time, e.g. through the “unsubscribe” link in the newsletter. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.
<br><br>
The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your subscription when said data will be deleted. Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remain unaffected.
<br><br>
<h4>How long we retain your data</h4>
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
<br><br>
For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
<br><br>
<h4>What rights you have over your data</h4>
If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
<br><br>
<h4>Where we send your data</h4>
Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.
<br><br>
<h4 id="protecting-the-privacy-rights-of-third-parties">PROTECTING THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES</h4>
If any postings you make on our website contain information about third parties, you must make sure you have permission to include that information in your posting. While we are not legally liable for the actions of our users, we will remove any postings about which we are notified, if such postings violate the privacy rights of others.
<br><br>
<h4 id="do-not-track-settings">DO NOT TRACK SETTINGS</h4>
Some web browsers have settings that enable you to request that our website not track your movement within our website. Our website does not obey such settings when transmitted to and detected by our website. You can turn off tracking features and other security settings in your browser by referring to your browser’s user manual.
<br><br>
<h4 id="links-to-other-websites">LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h4>
Our website may contain links to other websites. These websites are not under our control and are not subject to our privacy notice. These websites will likely have their own privacy notices. We have no responsibility for these websites and we provide links to these websites solely for your convenience. You acknowledge that your use of and access to these websites are solely at your risk. It is your responsibility to check the privacy notices of these websites to see how they treat your Personal Data.
<br><br>
<h4 id="protecting-children-s-privacy">PROTECTING CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h4>
Even though our website is not designed for use by anyone under the age of 16, we realize that a child under the age of 16 may attempt to access our website. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 16. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child is using our website, please contact us. Before we remove any information, we may ask for proof of identification to prevent malicious removal of account information. If we discover that a child is accessing our website, we will delete his/her information within a reasonable period of time. You acknowledge that we do not verify the age of our users nor do we have any liability to do so.
<br><br>
<h4 id="transferring-personal-data-from-the-european-union">TRANSFERRING PERSONAL DATA FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION</h4>
Personal Data (PD) that we collect from you may be stored, processed, and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate, more specifically Germany. The European Union has not found the United States and some other countries to have an adequate level of protection of Personal Data under Article 45 of the GDPR. Our company relies on derogations for specific situations as defined in Article 49 of the GDPR. For European Union customers and users, with your consent, your Personal Data may be transferred outside the European Union to the United States and other countries. We will use your Personal Data to provide the goods, services, and/or information you request from us to perform a contract with you or to satisfy a legitimate interest of our company in a manner that does not outweigh your freedoms and rights. Wherever we transfer, process or store your Personal Data, we will take reasonable steps to protect it. We will use the information we collect from you in accordance with our privacy notice. By using our website, services, or products, you agree to the transfers of your Personal Data described within this section.
<br><br>
<h4>Additional information</h4>
We may be legally required to disclose your Personal Data if such disclosure is
<ul>
<li>required by subpoena, law, or other legal process;</li>

</ul>
