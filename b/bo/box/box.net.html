<p>We at Box.net believe strongly in the right to privacy of 
our customers. We have developed the following privacy policy to protect our 
customers and inform everyone how we will use personal information. This policy 
covers the site
<a href="http://www.box.net/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">
www.box.net</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Information Collected</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Box.net collects personal information during registration. We will typically ask for your name and a valid email
address. We may use this 
information to contact customers in order to discuss the services that we
provide. We may also email customers regarding updates to our services.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to required registration information, we may 
conduct surveys which ask customers to volunteer information to be used on an 
aggregate basic for market research and product development. This information 
will be used to better tailor our products and services to the needs of our
customers. You are not required to volunteer the information requested in these 
surveys. </p>
<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
<p>Cookies are small files that are sent from your web browser 
and stored on your computer's hard drive. These tell us whether you have used 
our site previously and allow us to remember some of your preferences. We use 
cookies solely in order to improve our service to you. We do not use cookies 
that will obtain other information about you.</p>
<p><b>Use and Sharing of Information</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Box.net reserves the right to share aggregated demographic 
information about our customers, sales, and traffic to our partners and
advertisers. We will not give, sell, rent, share, or trade any of your 
personally identifiable information, or the data that you store using our 
service to any third party, except as outlined in our Terms of Service and in 
this privacy policy. We reserve the right to disclose such information to a 
third party only if (a) we have your express written consent, (b) we reasonably 
believe we are compelled by applicable state and federal laws, or (c) we 
reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or 
serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of the information 
without delay. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Box.net uses a third party vendor to manage all credit card 
processing, and may partner with other parties to provide specific services. Upon registration with
Box.net, we will share names and other contact 
information as necessary for the applicable third parties to provide these
services. These parties are not permitted under their contract with us to 
store, retain, or use your information for purposes not directly involved with 
their service to Box.net. &nbsp;Specifically, our contracts with such third parties 
prohibit the third parties from using your personal information for purposes of 
marketing or promotions. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Security</b> </p>
<p>User data is protected with SSL encryption for transmission 
to Box.net. No customer information is stored on Box.net employees' personal
computers. Only employees who require your personally identifiable information 
to perform a specific task are granted access to such information. The servers 
on which all customer data and information is stored are kept in a secure
environment.</p>
<b>
<p>Updating Personal Information</p>
</b>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes in any 
way, we request that you provide us the means to correct or update this 
information as soon as possible. To do so, please email any and all changes to

<b>
<p>Choice/Opt-Out</p>

receiving communications from us at any time. To opt-out of such communications 
or to remove your information from our database, email
<a href="mailto:support@box.net" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">
support@box.net</a> with your specific request.</p>
<b>
<p>Loss of Privacy</p>
</b>
<p>To date, we have never had a situation in which to our 
knowledge any of our users' personal information has been compromised in any 
way, or in which any user's personal information has become public. Should any 
such situation arise, we commit to notify you as soon as we can and take all 
reasonable steps to correct or ameliorate the situation.</p>
<b>

</b>

provide personally identifiable information, or to place a purchase with Box.net.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To better protect your privacy, we request that you not 
share your password with anyone. Always logout and close your browser when you 
finish your session. Note that we will never ask you to disclose your password 
in an unsolicited phone call or email.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Changes</b></p><b>

will post notice of changes to this policy on our website for 30 days before 
such changes take effect, unless an emergency requires otherwise. We encourage
