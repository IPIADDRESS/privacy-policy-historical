        <h2>1. WHEN THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT APPLIES. If a Service you’re using links to this Privacy Statement, this Statement applies to you. </h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Statement applies to our sites, products, and services (collectively, “Services“) that link to this Statement. BoldLeads is the responsible entity for all Personal Information subject to this Statement.</p>
        <h2>
            2. WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION. We want to be clear about what information we collect and how we use it to deliver our Services to you, improve your financial life, operate our business, and help make our Services useful, more intelligent, and work
            better for you. Except as detailed below, we do not sell or share your Personal Information with third parties for their own commercial uses without your consent.
        </h2>
        <p>
            a) Types of Information We Collect. In connection with accessing our Services, we may collect information from you that can be used to identify you (“Personal Information“), such as your name, shipping/billing address, email address, phone number, username,

            get information from other companies or third parties, or when we may use service providers to supplement the Personal Information you give us to help us maintain the accuracy of your data and provide you with better service. Finally, we also
            collect content or other information that you may provide or create when you interact with our Services.

            with our Services, and other usage information obtained from cookies and other tracking technologies. For example, we collect IP addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information, such as using IP addresses to monitor the regions from
            which users navigate to our Services. We also collect IP addresses from users when they log into the Services as part of our log-in and security features. We may also, when you enable location services, collect Global Positioning System (“GPS”)
            location data and/or motion data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Services may change over time and we may introduce new features that may collect new or different types of information.
        </p>
        <p>
            b) How We Use Your Information. We may use your information, including your Personal Information, for the following purposes:

            Accounts between users or individuals, without your consent.
