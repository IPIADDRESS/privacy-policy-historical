            <p>
                <strong><span class="c-span__text-underline">When you enter or upload information to the Website.</span></strong>

                Please note that, when you share information in a forum, whether private or public, you are contributing to an online conversation or thread. In ProBoards' experience, threads are deprived of necessary context, and are sometimes rendered false or misleading, when select posts are altered or deleted after the fact. For this reason, except as required under California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 or similar law, ProBoards does not allow you to bulk delete your content from published posts. In addition, your ability to edit or delete your content may depend on forum-specific rules and settings designated by moderators or administrators, so you should think carefully about what you post before you do so.
