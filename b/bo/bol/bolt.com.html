<a name="2"><b>What information does Bolt collect?</b></a><br>

Bolt wants to be your favorite online destination. To encourage your participation, your Bolt experience is personalized so that you are offered the services, products and information most relevant to you. This requires the collection of information to help tell you apart from other Bolt members. The forms are specially designed so that you don’t have to disclose any more information than is necessary to participate in a given activity or use a given tool.
<br><br>
Bolt collects two kinds of information: anonymous and personally identifiable. Anonymous information is not associated with specific individuals. For instance, Bolt may know how many people read this Privacy Policy today, but they don’t necessarily know their names, addresses or birthdays. Personally identifiable information reveals who you are and/or how you can be contacted. It includes your name, address, phone number and email address.
<br><br>
Below is a summary of the different ways Bolt collects various kinds of information about members:
<br><br>
<b>Registration (mandatory to be a Bolt member)</b><br>
If you decide to join Bolt, registration is the only place where you will be required to submit information about yourself.  To become a Bolt member, you need to complete a form with your email address (which can be your new Bolt email address), gender, birthday, zip code, and country.  Bolt uses this information to provide you with more personalized service, and to learn more about its audience demographics.
<br><br>
Only when you choose to participate in optional Bolt programs or services will registration information be linked to information you submit for other purposes. For example, if you decide to be a Bolt Rep, you’ll be asked to provide Bolt with your full name, address, school and graduating class. Bolt keeps this information in its database with your member name and other registration data. If you decide that you no longer want Bolt to have a certain piece of information about you, email the <a href="mailto:policy@boltinc.com?subject=Policy Question">Policy Manager</a>.

<br><b>Your Profile (optional)</b><br>
Information from registration will automatically be placed in your Member Profile. In addition, you can choose to tell everyone your hobbies, interests, likes and dislikes. You can fill out as much or as little of your Profile as you want. The more you fill out, the more likely it is that you’ll be able to meet members based on things you have in common.

<br><b>Wireless (optional)</b><br>

In your account settings, you can register to receive Bolt text messages on your cell phone or pager. To do this, you must submit your device's area code and number as well as the confirmation number Bolt provides to you. The wireless information you submit is linked to your member name and stored in a database that only authorized Bolt technical staff can access. For your protection, the tech staff has devised a system of verification to ensure that nobody but you can register your device.
<br><b>Other places (optional)</b><br>
Bolt runs promotions, contests, submission opportunities, surveys and programs designed to improve your experience on Bolt. To participate in these programs you may have to give contact (name, address, email address) and/or demographic (i.e., age, gender) information. This only goes to the authorized Bolt employees who run the promotion, contest or program so that they can inform you if you win, ask you questions about your submission and deal with other relevant details. Bolt understands your decision to participate as permission to contact you, if necessary, and to store this additional information in its databases with your registration data.
<br>
<b>Public forums (privacy warning)</b><br>
Bolt understands your decision to post in public areas as permission to contact you through your Bolt account.
<br><br>
One last thing to keep in mind: Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on message boards, through email, Bolt Notes, Zap, Journals, or in chat, it can be collected and used by anyone, including law-enforcement agencies acting under subpoena power. If you post personal information in public places, others may send you unsolicited email messages. Always be smart about the information you provide online. And, be aware that if Bolt employees find personally identifiable information posted in public areas, they will delete it.

<a name="3"><b>Does Bolt supplement the information it collects?</b></a><br>

Bolt receives zip and postal code-based data about demographics and income levels from third parties such as Nielsen and the U.S. Census.  Bolt appends such third party data to each member’s record to understand demographics and income levels for a zip or postal code or set of zip/postal codes.
<br><br>

<a name="4"><b>What are cookies, and how does Bolt use them?</b></a><br>
Bolt collects anonymous information through cookies. A cookie is a small piece of data containing a unique identification number that is sent to your browser from a web server, and is stored on your computer's hard drive. The unique ID number identifies your browser to Bolt’s computers whenever you visit. Cookies do not enable anyone to access personally identifiable information that you have not already given us. Bolt primarily uses cookies to connect members with account information stored on Bolt's computers. This helps Bolt deliver better and more personalized service. Bolt also uses cookies to estimate Bolt’s audience size for advertisers; to track the number of entries in Bolt promotions, sweepstakes and contests; to identify the areas of the site you visit; to hold session information; and to track user preferences.
<br><br>
Cookies are part of the technology implemented by your browser. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to either notify you when you have received a cookie, or to refuse them all together.

<br><br>
Bolt uses both permanent and temporary cookies. Permanent cookies stay with your browser, whereas temporary cookies go away after you close your browser. Bolt uses permanent cookies in order to recognize you between visits. Bolt uses temporary cookies to store information about your current visit to the site. That information goes away when you close your browser or shut down your computer. If you choose to not accept cookies, you cannot participate as a registered, signed-in member.
<br><br>
You should be aware that Bolt’s advertisers sometimes use banner ads to give you their own cookies.  If you want to understand how and why an advertiser uses cookies, check the company’s site for their privacy statement.<br><br>

Third Party Advertising<br>
We use MaxWorldwide and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="new"> click here </a>.<br><br>

Third Party Cookies<br>
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.

<br><br>
We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that help us better manage the content of our html emails. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Bolt uses clear gifs in its html emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. The clear gifs are not used in conjunction with other user information that is stored by Bolt.

<a name="5"><b>How does Bolt use member information?</b></a><br>
Bolt's decisions regarding the use of information collected from Bolt members are based on two areas of interest: market research, and improving user experience by offering personalized service, content and advertising.
<br><br>
Ads are a standard part of user experience on the Internet, and Bolt believes that targeted advertising enhances this experience. Bolt uses information collected from Bolt members to place ads where they believe interested parties will see them. For example, let’s say an advertiser wants to get the word out about a new set of ski boots for guys and girls aged 15-18 who live in Colorado. Bolt analyzes data from registration and cookies to find out where members who fit the bill hang out on Bolt, and place the ad accordingly. Don't worry: Advertisers never see or have access to your personal information without you knowing.
<br><br>
In addition to banner ads, Bolt may advertise products, companies and events that we think might interest you through the email address you provide.
<br><br>
Bolt may analyze information provided directly by you, or obtained through cookies or third parties to direct services and content based on your interests. This is done in the aggregate (for example, let’s say half of Bolt’s members are females who visit the boards more than the chat rooms) and at the individual level (for example, BoltUser1234 mostly visits the Sports section). Again, this helps the staff produce and appropriately feature tools and content tailored to your interests.
<br><br>
Bolt collects market research data in order to generate sales to corporate clients. Market research data are always anonymous and are never used to sell anything to individual respondents based on their personal responses. Market research data, however, may be used at the aggregate level to:
<br>
1.  Improve the likelihood of a sale to a group of Bolt members<br>
2.  Increase the likelihood that a group’s experience on Bolt is relevant to its
     interests as a whole<br>

3.  Formulate group-level statistical models that are used to accomplish goal #2 (above).
<br><br>
Bolt’s market research data is collected in two ways:
<br>
1. Among individuals who opt-in to take surveys during the registration process
      or while on Bolt (those who sign up are contacted and take surveys through
      email).<br>
2. Through surveys that we publicly post on Bolt (it is never mandatory to
      answer these surveys).
<br><br>
Bolt uses data at the individual level to sell products and services to Bolt members who express an interest in these products and services, through a poll for example, or to members who can be presumed to have an interest based on results from a statistical analysis.

<br><br>

<a name="6"><b>What information does Bolt log?</b></a><br>
When you surf the Internet, your browser automatically transmits information to the web sites you visit, including Bolt. Such information includes referral data (URL of the web page you were on before coming to Bolt), IP address and your browser version. Bolt collects this information to help improve services and moderate the site. All the information that is automatically submitted by your browser is considered anonymous.

<br><br>
Bolt also logs information you submit through registration, forms for optional programs, surveys and other entries, cookie data and communications transmitted through Bolt applications. Only authorized Bolt staff have access to your information in its entirety. Other employees may have access to bits and pieces of this information if it pertains to their job duties.
<br><br>
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's email address. Bolt will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Bolt does not store this information. It is used for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.
<br><br>
<a name="7"><b>What is Bolt’s information retention policy?</b></a><br>
To preserve the integrity of our databases, standard procedure calls for us to retain information submitted by members for an indefinite length of time. Bolt understands your submissions as consent to store all your information in one place for this indefinite length of time, if we so wish. If required by law, as is the case to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will nullify (scramble so that it is unrecognizable) member information. We will also respond to written member requests to nullify account information. If you wish to make such a request, which requires that we verify your identity, or if you have any questions regarding this policy, contact Bolt’s <a href="mailto:policy@boltinc.com?subject=Policy Question">Policy Manager</a>.
<br>
<a href="#top"><font face="arial" size="1">back to top</font></a>
<br><br>

<a name="8"><b>How does Bolt secure collected information?</b></a><br>

Your Bolt Profile is password-protected so that only you and authorized Bolt employees have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone. If anyone ever asks you for information claiming they are Bolt staff, check their Member Profile -- if it doesn’t say they are staff, they’re not. Also, if you share a computer, you should sign out of your Bolt account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will protect your information on public terminals.
<br><br>
Bolt makes every effort to ensure that your information is secure on its system. Only certain authorized Bolt employees can access this information if it’s relevant to their job duties. Bolt has staff dedicated to maintaining this Privacy Policy and other privacy initiatives, periodically reviewing web security and making sure that every Bolt employee is aware of our security practices. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, Bolt cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
<br><br>

<a name="9"><b>With whom does Bolt share information?</b></a><br>
When you submit information to Bolt, it is generally collected, processed and maintained solely by us. Sometimes we may allow partner companies to collect information about members from us or directly from you via their web site. When Bolt is the source, it is usually so that we can provide a service with a partner. We choose to work with upstanding companies that will treat your information responsibly. But, since we don't own these companies, we can't speak for them on privacy issues. Before telling them about yourself, check out their privacy statements. If you are not satisfied with their information practices, you can choose to not use their service.
<br><br>
Below is a summary of the situations in which Bolt might share information:
 <br><br>
<b>Co-Branding</b><br>
Some of our services, such as Bolt email, are offered in conjunction with partner companies. In order to provide these services, Bolt may choose to share some of you user data (e.g., user name and email address).
<br>
<b>Content Partners</b><br>

Some Bolt content is “sponsored by” or “presented by” other companies. Bolt typically shares market research data (how the sponsorship performed, names of contest winners, etc.) collected on the site or via email surveys with these partners. This information is aggregate and not linked to specific users.
<br>
<b>Partner Sponsorships</b><br>
Partners may sponsor promotions, contests and sweepstakes that require you to reveal details such as your name, address or phone number. Always check their privacy policy before revealing information about yourself. If you don’t want these sponsors to have your personal information, you can choose to not participate.
<br>
<b>Third Party Service Providers</b><br>
In order to provide secure online payment options for Bolt Plus subscribers, Bolt has partnered with a company called IBill. All payment information -- such as credit card or checking account details -- is collected by IBill on Bolt's behalf, and is therefore subject to <a href="http://www.ibill.com/about/privacy.cfm">IBill's privacy policy</a>.
<br><br>
When visitors come to Bolt, they may receive cookies from Bolt’s sponsors; this information is not shared with Bolt. This privacy statement does not address the information practices of our advertisers. You should read the privacy statements of all third-party sites, as their privacy policies may differ from Bolt’s.
<br><br>
Finally, Bolt reserves the right to disclose user information from both private and public areas of the site if required by law or if given reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that someone is causing injury to or interference with the rights of Bolt members or the general public, or with Bolt’s rights of property.
<br>
<b>Ad Serving</b><br>

Bolt uses Doubleclick as its third party ad server, to serve ads on the site. For more information about DoubleClick's privacy policy, <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;">click here</a>. <br>

<a href="#top"><font face="arial" size="1">back to top</font></a>
<br><br>

<a name="10"><b>What is Bolt’s opt-in/out policy? </b></a><br>
During registration you choose whether to receive correspondence from either Bolt or its partners and whether you want to participate in a variety of Bolt programs. This information lives on your Profile where you can, at any point, easily edit it to indicate that you have changed your mind. After logging on, click on "settings" button located below your member name on the top of the left-hand navigation bar. Then click on “email,” and make your selections under “Bolt emails” and “Special offers.” If you purchase anything through Bolt, we may occasionally contact you with information about special events, sales, and activities.  You always have the option to ask Bolt not to contact you with this information again.  As for promotions, contests, submission opportunities and programs, you will not be included unless you opt-in.
<br><br>
If you receive unsolicited email from a Bolt domain, please contact Bolt's <a href="mailto:policy@boltinc.com?subject=Policy Question">Policy Manager</a>.
<br><br>

<a name="11"><b>How can Bolt members edit their information?</b></a><br>
Bolt believes strongly in giving you the ability to access and edit your personal information.  You can always update the personal information in your Profile by clicking on the "profile" button located below your member name on the top of the left-hand navigation bar.  To change your personal account settings (e.g., your email address and password), click the "settings" button also located below your member name.  You can edit your Profile or account settings at any time -- all you need is your member name and password.
<br><br>
So that we can protect the integrity of sensitive data, there are certain pieces of information, such as your birthday, that you cannot alter yourself. For example, since children under 15 are not allowed to register as Bolt members, we need to take reasonable measures to preserve the accuracy of our members’ ages. Go to Bolt’s <a href="/apps/help/default.asp?story=/apps/help/index.asp" target="story_content">Help Center</a> to find out how to change information you cannot access through your Profile.
<br><br>
Our databases automatically update any personal information you edit in your Profile, or that you request we edit. Information transmitted through boards, miniboards, Bolt Notes, polls, Tagbooks or Journals remain in our databases. Keep this in mind if you decide to communicate personal information through any of these applications.
<br>
<a href="#top"><font face="arial" size="1">back to top</font></a>
<br><br>

<a name="12"><b>What action has Bolt taken to protect children’s privacy?</b></a><br>

Bolt is intended for people 13 or over. Our registration process is intentionally designed to identify children under 13 years of age. We have also made an effort to specifically limit Bolt’s appeal to people of age 13 and older. Bolt will not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. If it comes to our attention that a member has revealed on Bolt that they are under 13, a member of Bolt’s Community staff will immediately delete the account.
<br><br>
<b>Note to parents:</b><br>
If your child is under 13 and has become a Bolt member using a false age, please notify the <a href="mailto:policy@boltinc.com?subject=Policy Question">Policy Manager</a> who will immediately close the account and nullify all personally identifiable information collected from them. If your child is under the age of 18 and you would like to know more about our site, information practices, stored information on your child, or how to close your child’s account, contact Bolt’s Policy Manager.
<br>
<a href="#top"><font face="arial" size="1">back to top</font></a>
<br><br>

<a name="13"><b>Notification of Changes:</b></a><br>
Bolt’s security and privacy policy are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. This policy might change as Bolt updates and expands its services.  Bolt will contact you via email and post notification if there are any material changes in its privacy practices. Bolt also encourages you to also check the privacy policy out periodically.
<br><br>

<a name="14"><b>How can I reach Bolt staff?</b></a><br>
If you have technical problems, questions or other issues related to your use of Bolt, please check out the <a href="/apps/help/default.asp?story=/apps/help/index.asp" target="story_content">Help Center</a>.
<br><br>
Bolt’s <a href="mailto:policy@boltinc.com?subject=Policy Question">Policy Manager</a> will respond to all requests sent through mail or email from members and parents interested in knowing more about what personal information is stored on the Bolt database, or if they want their personal information nullified, or have additional questions regarding privacy.
