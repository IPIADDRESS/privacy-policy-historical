<h4>4.1 Information We Share</h4>

<p>We may share your information as described in this Privacy Policy (e.g., with Bolt Merchants; our Third-Party service providers; to comply with legal obligations; to protect and defend our rights and property) or with your permission.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Bolt Merchants</strong>. We may share any information we receive from you with the Bolt Merchant from whom you purchase or seek to purchase products or services in order to facilitate and support the transaction you have requested. In addition, the Bolt Merchant may have access to your information on its Merchant Dashboard or through our API so it can properly provide its own products or services to you.</li>
	<li><strong>We Use Vendors and Service Providers</strong>. We may share any information we receive with vendors and service providers. The types of service providers to whom we entrust Personal Information include service providers for: (i) provision of IT and related services; (ii) provision of information and services you have requested; (iii) payment processing; (iv) customer service activities; and (v) in connection with the provision of the Site and Services. Bolt has executed appropriate contracts with the service providers that prohibit them from using or sharing Personal Information except as necessary to perform the contracted services on our behalf or to comply with applicable legal requirements. </li>
	<li><strong>Business Partners</strong>. Bolt may share Personal Information with our business partners, and affiliates for our and our affiliates’ internal business purposes or to provide you with a Service that you have requested. Bolt may also provide Personal Information to business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. In such cases, our business partner’s name will appear, along with Bolt. Bolt requires our affiliates and business partners to agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality and security of Personal Information they maintain on our behalf and not to use it for any purpose other than the purpose for which Bolt provided them.</li>
	<li><strong>Marketing – Interest-Based Advertising and Third Party Marketing</strong>. Through our Services, Bolt may allow Third-Party advertising partners to set tracking tools (e.g., cookies) to collect information regarding your activities (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such de-identified information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) as well as selected Personal Information we have collected with Third-Party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non Bolt related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising. We may allow access to other data collected by the Site to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not share your Personal Information with Third-Party advertising partners, you may opt out of such sharing at no cost by following the instructions in Section 5 below.</li>
	<li><strong>Disclosures to Protect Us or Others (e.g., as Required by Law and Similar Disclosures)</strong>. We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information, other account information, and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (i) comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (ii) respond to your requests; (iii) protect yours’, ours’ or others’ rights, property, or safety; (iv) to enforce Bolt policies or contracts; (v) to collect amounts owed to Bolt; (vi) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (vii) if we, in good faith, believe that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes – e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Services. In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers</strong>. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract. In such event, Bolt will endeavor to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such Personal Information was collected.</li>
</ul>
<h4>4.2 International Data Transfers</h4>
<p>You agree that all Personal Information collected via or by Bolt may be transferred, Processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including but not limited to, the United States, the European Union, in the cloud, on our servers, on the servers of our affiliates or the servers of our service providers. Your Personal Information may be accessible to law enforcement or other authorities pursuant to a lawful request. By providing information to Bolt, you explicitly consent to the storage of your Personal Information in these locations.</p>

<h3>5. Opt-Out (Right to Object to Processing)</h3>
<h4>5.1 General</h4>
<p>You have the right to object to and opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information. Where you have consented to Bolt’s Processing of your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt out of further Processing by contacting <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cebdbbbebea1bcba8eaca1a2bae0ada1a3"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="592a2c2929362b2d193b36352d773a3634">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>. Even if you opt out, we may still collect and use non-Personal Information regarding your activities on our Sites and/or information from the advertisements on Third-Party websites for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.</p>
<h4>5.2 Email and Telephone Communications</h4>
<p>If you receive an unwanted email from us, you can use the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the email to opt out of receiving future emails. We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. Note that you will continue to receive transaction-related emails regarding Services you have requested. We may also send you certain non-promotional communications regarding Bolt and our Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications (e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms or this Privacy Policy).</p>
<p>We maintain telephone “do-not-call” and “do-not-mail” lists as mandated by law. We process requests to be placed on do-not-mail, do-not-phone and do-not-contact lists within 60 days after receipt, or such shorter time as may be required by law. </p>
<h4>5.3 "Do Not Track"</h4>
<p>Do Not Track (“<strong>DNT</strong>”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. </p>
<h4>5.4 Cookies And Interest-Based Advertising</h4>
<p>As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.</p>
<p>The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>, or <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a> and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>. You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-opt-out/fllaojicojecljbmefodhfapmkghcbnh?hl=en">here</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.</p>

<h3>6. Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction</h3>
<p>You may inquire as to whether Bolt is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may send an e-mail to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#55262025253a272115373a39217b363a38"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="06757376766974724664696a722865696b">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> or use any of the methods set out in this Privacy Policy to request access to, receive (port), seek rectification, or request erasure of Personal Information held about you by Bolt. Please include your full name, email address associated with your Account, and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.</p>
<p>Although Bolt makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Bolt is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Bolt determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Bolt will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.</p>

<h3>8. Security of Your Information</h3>
<p>We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us.
