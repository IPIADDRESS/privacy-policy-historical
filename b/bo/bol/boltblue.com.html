                    <span class="font1Normal">                 
			  We seek to comply worldwide with the Data Protection Act 
                      of 1998 (the "Act") and take all reasonable care to prevent 
                      any unauthorised access to your personal data. The main 
                      principles of the Act are that processing of personal data 
                      must be fair and reasonable and personal data should be 
                      secure, accurate and up-to-date. Generally speaking, each 
                      time we want to collect personal data we must first tell 
                      you the purposes for which we will use the data and then 
                      ask for your consent. We can only use your data for the 
                      purposes to which you consent. We must also tell you if 
                      we will transfer your data to anyone else. The Act allows 
                      you to write and ask to see and correct data held about 
                      you, though we may charge an administrative fee.</span>
                    <p class="font1Normal">We require those to whom we transfer 
                      personal data to keep your information confidential and 
                      to use it only for the express purpose for which it was 
                      provided. The persons to whom we may provide your personal 
                      information include: those who provide us with products 
                      and services that support the products and services we offer, 
                      credit reference agencies who may share your information 
                      with other organisations and who may keep a record of the 
                      searches we make in your name, telephone and similar directory 
                      services or directory inquiry services, selected persons 
                      whom we believe provide products or services that may be 
                      of interest to you, persons involved in the prevention or 
                      detection of fraud or crime or the apprehension or prosecution 
                      of offenders and persons to whom we may be required to pass 
                      your information by law or governmental or regulatory authority. 
                      We seek to impose restrictions on contracting parties with 
                      the aim of protecting your personal data.</p>
                    <p class="font1Normal">Because Boltblue's services operate

                      work to protect personal information transferred to countries 
                      that do not have adequate data protection laws, including 
                      outside the European Union.</p>
