<p><strong>What is a Privacy Policy ?</strong><br><br>
A privacy policy is a disclaimer placed on a website informing users about how the website deals with a user's personal information. The privacy policy generally contains information regarding whether or how their information is shared with parent companies, subsidiaries, or third parties. Often this also explains how or if the website uses cookies and web bugs.<br><br>
Some websites also define their privacy policies using P3P or Internet Content Rating Association (ICRA), allowing browsers to automatically assess the level of privacy offered by the site. Sometimes it's not good to give your personal information and that's why you should read the privacy policy.<br><br>
We respect your privacy and want to assure you that sharing your personal information is safe and secure at BollywoodSARGAM.com
</p>

<p><strong>What is Internet Privacy and the controversaies related to it ?</strong><br><br>
Internet privacy consists of privacy over the media of the Internet: the ability to control what information one reveals about oneself over the Internet, and to control who can access that information. Many people use the term to mean universal Internet privacy: every user of the Internet possessing Internet privacy.
<br><br>
Internet privacy forms a subset of computer privacy. Experts in the field of Internet privacy have a consensus that Internet privacy does not really exist. Privacy advocates believe that it should exist.
</p>

<p><strong>What are levels of Privacy ?</strong><br><br>
People with only a casual interest in Internet privacy need not achieve total anonymity. Regular Internet users with an eye to privacy may succeed in achieving a desirable level of privacy through careful disclosure of personal information and by avoiding spyware. The revelation of IP addresses, non-personally-identifiable profiling, and so on might become acceptable trade-offs for the convenience that such users would otherwise lose in using the workarounds needed to suppress such details rigorously. On the other hand, some people desire much stronger privacy. In that case, they may use Internet anonymity to ensure privacy use of the Internet without giving any third parties the ability to link the Internet activities to personally-identifiable information of the Internet user.
</p>

<p><strong>What are Privacy research center and their information?</strong><br><br>
EPIC is a public interest research center in Washington, D.C. It was established in 1994 to focus public attention on emerging civil liberties issues and to protect privacy, the First Amendment, and constitutional values.
<br><br>
EPIC publishes an award-winning e-mail and online newsletter on civil liberties in the information age the EPIC Alert. We also publish reports and even books about privacy, open government, free speech, and other important topics related to civil liberties.<br>
<a href="http://www.epic.org/" target="_blank">Visit EPIC website</a>
</p>

<p><strong>What is American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU Foundation?</strong><br><br>
The tremendous explosion in surveillance-enabling technologies, combined with the ongoing weakening in legal restraints that protect our privacy have us drifting toward a surveillance society. The ACLU's Technology and Liberty Project fights this trend and works to preserve the American tradition that the government not track individuals or violate privacy unless it has evidence of wrongdoing.<br>

<p><strong>What is Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF?</strong><br><br>

<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices.
