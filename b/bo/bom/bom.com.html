<p>Arena Solutions has created this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on the Arena web site (the “Site”) is of utmost importance to us. This Privacy Policy describes our information-gathering and dissemination practices. By using the Site or providing any personal information when using the Site, you are agreeing to the collection and use of information in the manner described below.</p>
<p><strong>Information Gathered</strong></p>
<p><strong>Registration and Billing Information:</strong> We require users of the Site to provide contact information such as their name, e-mail address and company name and, when applicable, billing information such as billing address and credit card number. When one registers for services on the Site (“Services”) or requests more information about the Services, we may also ask for additional personal information such as title, department name or fax number, or additional company information such as annual revenues, number of employees or industry.</p>
<p>Users can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked.</p>
<p><strong>Log Data:</strong> Arena also collects certain information from visitors to and users of the Site, such as Internet addresses, browser types and referring domains. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems and administer the Site in order to constantly improve the quality of the Service. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage-and-volume statistical information from visitors and users, and provide such information to third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer’s hard drive. Arena uses cookies to tell us whether users and visitors have previously visited the Site. We associate cookie and/or log information with personal information when troubleshooting our systems. Arena also uses a persistent cookie to help save and retrieve usernames of users accessing <br>
the Site and to save a user’s preferences from one session to the next. Arena issues a session cookie only to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a specific session. The session cookie does not include the username or password of the user. If the cookie is rejected, access to and usage of the Services may be denied or otherwise limited. Some of <br>
our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Arena Solutions www.arenasolutions.com and app.bom.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by <br>
any advertisers.</p>
<p><strong>Invite a Supplier:</strong> If a user elects to invite its suppliers to review and provide input on the data it has entered as part of the Service, then the user will need to provide the name and e-mail address of each such supplier. Arena will automatically send the suppliers a one-time e-mail inviting them to review and provide input on the requesting user’s data. Arena stores this information for the purpose of sending this one-time e-mail and to facilitate access by the supplier to the user’s data. The supplier may opt out of receiving future e-mails from Arena by contacting us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@arenasolutions.com?subject=Unsubscribe">unsubscribe@arenasolutions.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Information Use</strong><br>
Arena Solutions uses the information that we collect to set up Services for users and to improve the Site. We may also use the information to contact users to further discuss their interest in the Site and the Services, or to send users information regarding Arena or its partners, such as promotions and events. We may also e-mail to users information regarding updates to the Services or the Site. To opt out of receiving such information, users can send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@arenasolutions.com?subject=Unsubscribe">privacy@arenasolutions.com</a>.</p>
<p>All financial and billing information collected through the Site is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective users and to bill for Services. This billing information is not used by Arena Solutions for marketing or promotional purposes. Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on the Site, but they are not permitted to collect any information; nor does Arena share any user information with these parties. To facilitate mailings to our customers, Arena may provide the necessary mailing information to bonded third-party contractors who perform the mailing on our behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Hosted Data</strong><br>
Users of the Service will be using the Site to host data. Data may at times be viewed or accessed by Arena only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue or suspected violation of the Terms of Use for the Site, or as may be required by law. Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Arena will not review, share, distribute, print or reference any data posted to the Site by users.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing of Information</strong><br>
Arena may share aggregated demographic information with partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify an individual person.</p>
<p>Arena Solutions may use a credit card processing company to bill users for Services. This company will not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any purpose other than as needed to perform such billing.</p>
<p>Arena may partner with other parties to provide specific services. If a user registers for these services, we will share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.</p>
<p>From time to time we may provide information about users to Arena’s subsidiaries and joint ventures in order to provide those users the Service. Each of these entities will comply with the policies described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, if the stock or assets of Arena Solutions, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures or any combination of such are acquired by another entity, some or all of Arena users’ personal information and hosted data may be provided to such successor. In such a case, the successor will handle the personal information and hosted data in the same manner as provided in this Privacy Policy. Please see our Notice of Changes section below.</p>
<p>Other than as expressly described in this Privacy Policy, Arena will not share, sell or rent a user’s personally identifiable information or hosted data with anyone outside of Arena, without such user’s prior permission or unless ordered by a court of law.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong><br>
The Site contains links to other sites. Arena is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage Arena users to be aware when they leave the Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Site.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
Arena Solutions takes every precaution to protect our users’ information and data against loss, misuse and alteration. As a web-native application, our success will be predicated on the security of that information and data. We use standard industry practices as outlined in our security statement to help prevent unauthorized use of, access to or alteration of user information and hosted data. These practices include the appropriate use of firewalls, SSL encryption, system redundancies, and co-location at a 24/7 secured, controlled environment.</p>
<p>Arena personnel with access to information gathered from users have been advised of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of such information and of using it only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong><br>
Whenever users submit requests for more information or Services from us, they may opt out of entering certain fields. However, such decision may affect the ability to use portions of the Site and Services. Users who no longer wish to receive our promotional emails, may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each communication or by contacting us at 650.513.3500 or 4100 East Third Avenue, Suite 300 Foster City, CA 94404 or emailing us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@arenasolutions.com?subject=Unsubscribe">unsubscribe@arenasolutions.com</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Updating Contact Information</strong><br>
We encourage our users to update and edit their contact information and keep it current. Users can easily correct or update their contact information at any time through the Service or by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@arenasolutions.com">privacy@arenasolutions.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Notice of Changes</strong><br>
Arena Solutions may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If Arena is going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>
