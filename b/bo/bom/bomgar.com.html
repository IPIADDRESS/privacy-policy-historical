          <p class="body">What information are we collecting and  how are we collecting it?</p>
          <p class="body">When you order products or services,  participate in surveys, or apply for a job at Bomgar, we will ask you to  provide personal information to complete these transactions. The types of  personal information you provide to us on these pages may include contact  information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address;  and other unique information such as user IDs and passwords, billing and transaction  information, credit card information, product and service preferences, contact  preferences, educational and employment background, and job interest data. In  addition to the information you provide to us, Bomgar may also collect  information during your visit to the Bomgar Network through our automatic data  collection tools (“Data Collection Tools”), which include cookies, Web beacons,  embedded Web links, and other commonly used information-gathering tools. These  Data Collection Tools collect certain standard information that your browser  sends to our website such as your browser type and language, access times, and  the address of the website from which you arrived at the Bomgar Network. These  Data Collection Tools may also collect information about your Internet Protocol  (IP) address, clickstream behavior and product information. When a visitor  requests a page from any web site within the Bomgar Network, our web servers  automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain  name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address  from which you have accessed our site. Bomgar also collects information from  credible third party commercially available sources. This information may  include your name, address, email address and demographic data which may be may  be used along with the information Bomgar collects when you visit the Bomgar  Network. </p>
          <p class="body">We use Google Analytics, a third-party  tracking service, which uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable  information about our visitors to our site in the aggregate to capture usage  and volume statistics. Some of our business partners (e.g., Google Analytics)  use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.  This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Bomgar only and does not  cover the use of cookies by any third-party.</p>
          <p class="body">How do we use your information?</p>
          <p class="body">Bomgar collects information to better  understand your needs and interests to help deliver a consistent and  personalized experience on the Bomgar Network. As a condition to being allowed  to download a trial or evaluation software from the Bomgar Network, you consent  to being contacted by Bomgar or its representatives to provide you with  information about our other products and/or services that we think will be of  interest to you. We will give you the opportunity to choose your privacy  preferences regarding the communications we send (see below – How do I Select  Privacy Preferences). Credit card information is used only for payment processing  and fraud prevention. Credit card information and other sensitive personal  information required to process a credit decision is not used for any other  purpose by our financial services providers or Bomgar and will not be kept  longer than necessary for providing the services, unless you ask us to retain  your credit card information for future purchases.</p>
          <p class="body">What are cookies and how do we use  them? </p>
          <p class="body">From time to time, the Bomgar Network  may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of  data that is sent to your Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your  computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off of your computer hard disk  or read cookie files created by other Web sites. We use cookies to identify  which areas of the Bomgar Network you have visited or customized, so the next  time you visit us, those pages may be readily accessible. You can choose  whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your Internet browser.  You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show  you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies,  your experience at our site and other web sites may be diminished and some  features may not work as intended. </p>
          <p class="body">What are web beacons and how do we use  them?</p>
          <p class="body">Some parts of the Bomgar Network may  use Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information  about your website usage and your interaction with email. A Web beacon is an  electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF. Web beacons can  recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the  time and date of a page viewed, and a description of the page where the Web  beacon is placed. You may be able to disable Web beacons in email messages by  not downloading images contained in the message you receive (this feature  varies depending on the email software used on your personal computer).  However, doing this may not always disable a Web beacon or other automatic data  collection tools in the email message due to specific email software  capabilities. If you choose to receive marketing emails or newsletters from  Bomgar may automatically collect personal information about you. For example,  through Web beacons and personalized URLs embedded in these emails or newsletters,  Bomgar can track whether you’ve opened those messages and whether you’ve  clicked on links contained within those messages. For more information on  embedded Web links, see below.</p>
          <p class="body">What are embedded web links and how do  we use them? </p>
          <p class="body">Some emails from Bomgar may use links  designed to lead you to a relevant area on the Web. The redirection system  allows Bomgar to change the destination URL of these links, if necessary, and  to determine the effectiveness of our marketing initiatives. In emails, such  web links may also allow Bomgar to determine whether you have clicked a link in  an email, and this information about the interaction may be connected to your  personal identity. If you do not want Bomgar to collect information about the  links that you click, you can: (1) change your choice about how you receive  communications from Bomgar (i.e. choose a text-based version of the message  where available); or (2) choose not to click links in an email that Bomgar  sends. </p>
          <p class="body">Will we disclose the information we  collect to outside third parties? </p>
          <p class="body">Bomgar will not sell, rent or lease  your personal information to others except as described in this Privacy Policy.  Bomgar shares personal information in the following ways: </p>
          <p class="body">(1) Bomgar retains service providers  and suppliers to deliver complete products, services and customer solutions and  to assist Bomgar with marketing and communication initiatives. These providers  and suppliers include, for example, credit card processors, providers of  customer support and live-help, email service providers, automated data  processors, and shipping agents. Suppliers and service providers are required  to keep confidential the information received on behalf of Bomgar and may not  use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing  for Bomgar. <br>
              (2) Except as described in this Privacy  Policy, Bomgar will not share the personal information you provide to Bomgar  with non-Bomgar third parties without your permission, unless to: (i) comply  with any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, or court order, (ii) respond to  authorized information requests of police and governmental authorities; (iii)  protect the personal safety of Bomgar employees and third parties on Bomgar  property; (iv) help prevent fraud or to enforce or protect the rights and  properties of Bomgar; or as a part of a sale, merger or other reorganization of  the Company; (v) or to any other third party without your prior consent to do  so.</p>
          <p class="body">How do I select privacy preferences?</p>
          <p class="body">You may opt out of receiving  communications from Bomgar by using one of the following methods: </p>
          <p class="body">(1) Select the email "opt  out" or "unsubscribe" link, or follow the opt-out instructions  included in each email communication.<br>
              (2) Return to the Bomgar Web page(s) where you originally registered your  preferences and follow the opt-out instructions. <br>
          (3) Write to Bomgar. Be sure to provide your name, email and postal address,  and specific relevant information about the </p>
          <p class="body">Bomgar communications that you no  longer wish to receive.<br>
            Please note that when you opt out of  receiving certain communications, it may affect the services you have chosen to  receive from Bomgar where accepting the communications is a condition of  receiving the services.</p>
          <p class="body">How do we keep your personal  information secure?</p>
          <p class="body">To prevent unauthorized access or  disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the  information, Bomgar utilizes appropriate physical, technical and administrative  procedures to safeguard the information we collect. Bomgar uses Secure Sockets  Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive information  such as credit card information.
