<h2 align="center">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>At BoardingArea we are just as concerned about privacy as you are.</p>

<p>It is our goal to protect your privacy when you visit or participate in any of our blogs and to make your online experience safe and enjoyable. Because we collect certain types of information about you when you visit our blogs, we have written this Privacy Policy to share our practices and use of that information.</p>

<h4>Types of Information We Collect:</h4>
<p><b>- Anonymous Information</b><br>
We collect anonymous information from our visitors that cannot be associated with a specific individual. For example, we know how many people visit BoardingArea, but we don't know their names or any other personal information about them. We collect this type of anonymous data in order to track overall Web site traffic and the specific pages that people visit most often. This anonymous tracking information is used to build a better service and enhance the content in our most popular blogs. Some of this anonymous tracking information is shared with third parties such as advertisers, but again, it remains anonymous.</p>

<p><b>- Comment Information</b><br>
We store the comments you leave on a blog when responding to a bloggers post. This information is yours, and is never used by BoardingArea for purposes other than what you intended.</p>



<p><b>- Personal Information</b><br>
We collect personal information when you voluntarily register to host a blog in our free hosting section, called Prior To Boarding. Registration is required to access some of the features of this service. The only personal information collected upon signing up for a hosted blog is a working email address.</p>

<p><b>- The Way We Use Information</b><br>
We use your email address to send a confirmation email when you sign up for a hosted blog and to allow you to reset your password if you lose or forget your old one. We will also send you a notice to let you know if your blog has been accepted or declined. And finally, our administrators might send you an email if circumstances warrant it. No other use is now or ever will be made of this email address. We will not send you any other email unless you contact us first and specifically request information, technical help, or administrative assistance. We do not sell this address, or link it to any other personal information.</p>

<p><b>- Our Commitment To Data Security</b><br>
To prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>

<p>Occasionally BoardingArea or its sponsors may need to place a "cookie" on your computer. A cookie serves only to preserve a history of your previous visits to BoardingArea, such as your name, email, and URL when leaving comments. Cookies do not usually create any problems for you or your computer and are generally silent bystanders. They are primarily used to create a unique user experience based on your previous activity on BoardingArea. These cookies are not used to "track" you online, as has become a popular misconception. The cookie on your computer is only readable by BoardingArea, and you are free to delete it at any time. You can elect to refuse cookies and/or delete cookies. If you choose to do so, any information that was collected on past visits to BoardingArea, such as login information, will not be stored. The choice is always yours, and we in no way discourage you from taking your privacy into your own hands.</p>

<h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>
<p>BoardingArea contains links to other blogs that are not hosted by BoardingArea. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of such other blogs.</p>

<h4>Surveys or Contests</h4>
<p>From time to time we sponsor surveys and contests. If you participate, we will request certain Personal Information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you will have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Contest information typically includes information such as name and mailing address. We only use this information internally to determine eligibility, notify contest winners, and to measure the success of our efforts.</p>

<h4>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h4>
<p>While we don't anticipate any changes in our privacy policy, there is always a possibility of change. If there is any substantial change to our policy, we will post those changes on pages we deem appropriate so that you are aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>

<h4>Contacting BoardingArea</h4>
<p>If you have additional questions, please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@boardingarea.com">privacy@boardingarea.com</a>, or write to us at:</p>
