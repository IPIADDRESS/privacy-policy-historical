            <h3>California Do Not Track Notice</h3>

            <p>Certain websites and other technology can track their users over time to, for instance, provide targeted
                advertising. Do Not Track ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">DNT</span>") mechanisms allow Internet
                users to control, and where desired prevent, the tracking of their online activities across such websites and
                technology. Currently, various Internet browsers offer a DNT option that sends signals to websites visited by
                the browser about the users DNT preference - you can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's
                preferences. Specifically as DNT relates to your use of our Services, we currently do not have the capability to
                recognize or respond to web browser Do Not Track signals and other similar mechanisms.

            <h3>Canada's Anti-Spam Law</h3>

            <p>Commercial electronic messages that are sent from or accessed in Canada, including emails and text messages
                ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">CEMs</span>"), are governed by Canada's Anti-Spam Law and its
                relevant rules and regulations ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">CASL</span>"). CASL requires that any
                CEMs sent to Canadian recipients in connection with our Services comply with certain consent and informational
                requirements (generally speaking, CASL prohibits sending CEMs to Canadian recipients without the prior consent
                of the recipient). Consent may either be implied (which is temporary) or express (which is permanent, unless and
                until withdrawn). Examples of implied consent to receive CEMs include (i) your having purchased something from
                us within the past two years, (ii) your download of software included within our Services or (iii) your giving
                us your business card at a trade show. You provide express consent when you affirmatively elect to receive CEMs
                in response to a clear solicitation to do so (for instance, filling out a form on one of our websites where the
                form clearly states that you will receive CEMs from Dominion Marine Media). When applicable, Dominion Marine
                Media will ask for your express consent to receive CEMs, and will respect your decision. Under any
                circumstances, however, you have the right to withdraw your consent -- whether express or implied -- by
                completing our <b><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dominionenterprises.com/privacy/de-email-opt-out-form/" target="_blank">Email Opt Out Form</a></b> or by contacting us via the contact information
