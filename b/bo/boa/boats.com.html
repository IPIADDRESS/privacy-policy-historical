It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits to a website. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.<br><br>You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google Ad Preferences page</a>, and if you want to you can <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">permanently using a browser plugin</a>.<br><br><h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3><br>To enhance your experience with our Services, many of our Web pages use "cookies". Cookies are text files we place in your computer's or mobile device's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or reveal other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one or more of our websites. However, once you choose to furnish us with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.<br><br>We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our Services. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at one or more of our websites (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our websites), save your password in password-protected areas and enable you to use shopping carts on our websites. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs or services.<br><br>"Web beacons" or clear .gifs are small pieces of code placed on a Web page to monitor behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a Web page. For example, Web beacons or similar technology can be used to count the users who visit a website or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We may use Web beacons or similar technology on our Services from time to time for this and other purposes.<br><h3>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Services, Ad Servers and Sponsors</h3><br>Our Services may contain links to other websites or services whose information practices may be different than ours. For example, while using one or more of our websites, you may link to a third party's website via a window opened within (or on top of) our website. Some of our Services may allow users to interface with third party websites or services, such as Facebook and Twitter. You will remain logged into those third party websites or services until you actively log off. By interfacing with those third party websites or services, you are allowing our Services to access your information that is or becomes available via such third party websites or services, and you are agreeing to those third party's applicable terms and conditions. Once you log onto any such third party websites or services, the content you post there may also post to our Services. Our Privacy Policy and procedures may or may not be consistent with the policies and procedures of such third party websites or services, and when you visit such websites or services our Privacy Policy does not apply to personally identifiable information and other data collected by the third party. You should consult, read and understand the privacy notices of such third parties before choosing to provide personally identifiable information on any such websites or services.<br><br>Our Services may also use a third party ad server to present the advertisements that you may see on our Services. These third party ad servers may use cookies, Web beacons, clear .gifs or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness. The use of these technologies by these third party ad servers is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Policy.<br><br><h3>California Do Not Track Notice</h3><br>Certain websites and other technology can track their users over time to, for instance, provide targeted advertising. Do Not Track ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">DNT</span>") mechanisms allow Internet users to control, and where desired prevent, the tracking of their online activities across such websites and technology. Currently, various Internet browsers offer a DNT option that sends signals to websites visited by the browser about the users DNT preference - you can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's preferences. Specifically as DNT relates to your use of our Services, we currently do not have the capability to recognize or respond to web browser Do Not Track signals and other similar mechanisms.<br><h3>Canada's Anti-Spam Law</h3><br>Commercial electronic messages that are sent from or accessed in Canada, including emails and text messages ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">CEMs</span>"), are governed by Canada's Anti-Spam Law and its relevant rules and regulations ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">CASL</span>"). CASL requires that any CEMs sent to Canadian recipients in connection with our Services comply with certain consent and informational requirements (generally speaking, CASL prohibits sending CEMs to Canadian recipients without the prior consent of the recipient). Consent may either be implied (which is temporary) or express (which is permanent, unless and until withdrawn). Examples of implied consent to receive CEMs include (i) your having purchased something from us within the past two years, (ii) your download of software included within our Services or (iii) your giving us your business card at a trade show. You provide express consent when you affirmatively elect to receive CEMs in response to a clear solicitation to do so (for instance, filling out a form on one of our websites where the form clearly states that you will receive CEMs from Dominion Marine Media). When applicable, Dominion Marine Media will ask for your express consent to receive CEMs, and will respect your decision. Under any circumstances, however, you have the right to withdraw your consent -- whether express or implied -- by completing our <strong><a href="http://www.dominionenterprises.com/privacy/de-email-opt-out-form/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Email Opt Out Form</a></strong> or by contacting us via the contact information provided below.<br><br><h3>Our Commitment to Security</h3><br>We have in place what we believe to be reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access of, maintain data security for and correctly use the personally identifiable information you have provided or that we otherwise collect through our Services. <strong>HOWEVER, WHILE SUCH EFFORTS ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES, WE CANNOT AND DO NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THE ABSOLUTE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.</strong><br><ul><br>	<li style="list-style: disc outside;">We work to protect the security of your personally identifiable information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
