<h1>Terms of Use &amp; Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Terms of Use</h2>
<p>The use of this site constitutes acceptance of the BoaterExam.com Terms of Use policies.</p>
<h3>Return policy</h3>
    <p>Once a customer has registered on BoaterExam.com, if they decide that they 
		no longer wish to take their exam online, they may transfer their credit 
		to another person of their choice. They must advise BoaterExam.com of 
		the change by e-mail or telephone within 90 days of the registration date. 
		There will be no refunds, unless the customer was charged more than once 
		due to technical problems, during the registration process.</p>
	<p>If you do not receive your card within 90 days of passing your exam, please 
		contact <a href="mailto:info@boaterexam.com">info@boaterexam.com</a>, 
		waiting beyond the 90 days will result in a $15 fee to have another card 
		issued. If there is an error on the card, such as your name or date of 
		birth, you also have 90 days to report it. </p>
	<h3>Expiry of Account</h3>
<p>The customer has one year from the date of the registration to use his or her ID to take 
	the online exam. Waiting longer than one year could result in the account expiring and loss 
	of funds.</p>
<h3>Fraudulent Activity</h3>
<p>In the case where a customer uses a stolen credit card or cheque, or does not have permission 
	for it's use, the customer may not receive his/her Operator Card and could face criminal 
	charges.</p>
    <p>In the case where BoaterExam.com is able to reasonably confirm that an Exam 
		Supervisor was not present during an exam, that a fraudulent name was 
		used for the Supervisor, or that cheating took place, the customer will 
		not receive a refund and will not receive his/her Operator's Card.</p>
