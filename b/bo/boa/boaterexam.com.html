                    Our Privacy Commitment</h3>
                    <p>This version in effect since May 16th, 2007.</p>
                <p>
                    At BOATERexam.com™ we know how important it is to protect your personal information.
                    Whether you are shopping with us online or in person we want to make every customer
                    experience safe and secure. In keeping with that goal, we have developed this Privacy
                    Policy to outline our guidelines for the collection and use of personal information.</p>

                <h3>
                    Who is BOATERexam.com™?</h3>

                <p>
                    BOATERexam.com™ is the operating name of Boater Exam America, Inc., a leading provider of safe boater education across North America.
                    This privacy policy applies to Boater Exam America, Inc. and all of its named operations and divisions.</p>

                <h3>
                    What Information does BOATERexam.com™ Collect and How is it Used?</h3>

                <p>
                    At BOATERexam.com™, we collect two types of information: personal information and
                    non-personal information.</p>

                <p>
                    With your consent we may use your personal information for a number of different
                    purposes, for example to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>fulfill requests for products, services or information; </li>
                    <li>provide customer services; </li>
                    <li>administer contests or promotions; </li>
                    <li>offer new products and services; </li>
                    <li>measure and improve the effectiveness of our Web Sites or our marketing endeavors;
                        and </li>
                    <li>tailor our online or on-site offerings to your preferences. </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We may also collect and summarize customer information in a format that no longer
                    identifies the individual for statistical purposes.</p>

                <p>
                    Personal information typically includes your name, address, phone number, and e-mail
                    address. You can always choose not to provide us with any of your personal information.
                    However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product,
                    service, or information that you requested.</p>

                <p>
                    Non-personal information does not identify you as an individual. For example, we
                    may ask you for your postal code to assist us with planning our advertising and
                    promotional efforts.</p>

                <p><strong>
                    Your Implied Consent</strong></p>

                <p>
                    In some cases, your consent is implied if we ask you to provide personal information
                    with a stated purpose. For example, we can only deliver the product you have purchased
                    if you provide us with your address and phone number.</p>

                <p><strong>
                    Your Express Consent</strong></p>

                <p>
                    In other cases, we will ask you to give your express consent to use your personal
                    information to advise you of products or services that may be of interest. You always
                    have the opportunity to "opt out" of having your information used for this purpose.</p>

                <p><strong>
                    Withdrawing Your Consent</strong></p>

                <p>
                    If you have "opted in" or subscribed to one of our newsletters or mailing lists,
                    we will always provide you the opportunity to "opt out" or unsubscribe. For example,
                    each e-mail we send you will tell you how to decline further e-mail.</p>

                    Information BOATERexam.com™ Collects from You</h3>

                <p>

                    delivery of products, mailing of your Boater Education Card, and rebate requests.

                <p>
                    While using our Web Sites, you may be asked to voluntarily provide certain personal
                    information (such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number,

                    and to apply for access to certain special features and functions of the Web Sites.

                    With any of the services on our Web Sites, we may also use your personal information
                    to contact and correspond with you and to respond to your inquiries. With your consent,

                    that no longer identifies the contest entrants for analysis, but will not share

                    Information BOATERexam.com™ collects Automatically</h3>

                <p>
                    Like many other Web sites, we automatically collect certain non-personal information
                    regarding Web site users that does not identify you. Examples include the Internet
                    Protocol (IP) address of your computer, the IP address of your Internet Service
                    Provider, the date and time you access the Web Site, the Internet address of the
                    Web site from which you linked directly to the Web Site, the operating system you
                    are using, the sections of the Web Site you visit, the Web Site pages read and images
                    viewed, and the content you download from the Web Site.</p>

                <p>
                    This non-personal information is used for Web Site and system administration purposes

                    Cookies</strong></p>

                <p>
                    The Web Site uses "cookies", a technology that installs a small amount of information
                    on a Web Site user's computer to permit the Web Site to recognize future visits
                    using that computer. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the Web Site. For
                    example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a
                    previous user of the Web Site (so you do not have to enter your billing information
                    every time), to offer personalized Web page content and information for your use,
                    to track your activity at the Web Site, to respond to your needs, and to otherwise
                    facilitate your Web Site experience. You may choose to decline cookies if your browser
                    permits, but doing so may affect your use of the Web Site and your ability to access
                    certain features of the Web Site or engage in transactions through the Web Site.</p>

                <p>The Web Site uses third party display advertising networks to collect visitor data 
                and then serve targeted display ads back to these visitors when browsing other web sites.  
                Our partners use technology such as cookies and web beacons to collect this data.

                <p><strong>
                    Tracking Information</strong></p>

                <p>
                    We may use non-personal information to compile tracking information reports regarding
                    Web Site user demographics, Web Site traffic patterns, and Web Site purchases, and
                    then provide those reports to advertisers and others. None of the tracking information
                    in the reports can be connected to the identities or other personal information
                    of individual users. We may also link tracking information with personal information
                    voluntarily provided by Web Site users. Once such a link is made, all of the linked
                    information is treated as personal information and will be used and disclosed only
                    in accordance with this Policy.</p>

                <p>
                    You can check your information to verify, update, or correct it, and to have any
                    obsolete information removed. </p>

                    Subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law, and provided we can authenticate
                    your identity, you will be given reasonable access to your personal information,
