<h2>
Our Privacy Commitment</h2>
<p>This version in effect since May 16th, 2007.</p>
<p>
At BOATERexam.com<sup>®</sup> we know how important it is to protect your personal information.
Whether you are shopping with us online or in person we want to make every customer
experience safe and secure. In keeping with that goal, we have developed this Privacy
Policy to outline our guidelines for the collection and use of personal information.</p>
<h3>
Who is BOATERexam.com<sup>®</sup>?</h3>
<p>
BOATERexam.com<sup>®</sup> is the operating name of Boater Exam America, Inc., a leading provider of safe boater education across North America.
This privacy policy applies to Boater Exam America, Inc. and all of its named operations and divisions.</p>
<h3>
What Information does BOATERexam.com<sup>®</sup> Collect and How is it Used?</h3>
<p>
At BOATERexam.com<sup>®</sup>, we collect two types of information: personal information and
non-personal information.</p>
<p>
With your consent we may use your personal information for a number of different
purposes, for example to:</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>fulfill requests for products, services or information; </li>
<li>provide customer services; </li>
<li>administer contests or promotions; </li>
<li>offer new products and services; </li>
<li>measure and improve the effectiveness of our Web Sites or our marketing endeavors; and </li>
<li>tailor our online or on-site offerings to your preferences. </li>
</ul>
<p>
We may also collect and summarize customer information in a format that no longer
identifies the individual for statistical purposes.</p>
<p>
Personal information typically includes your name, address, phone number, and e-mail
address. You can always choose not to provide us with any of your personal information.
However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product,
service, or information that you requested.</p>
<p>
Non-personal information does not identify you as an individual. For example, we
may ask you for your postal code to assist us with planning our advertising and
promotional efforts.</p>
<p><strong>
Your Implied Consent</strong></p>
<p>
In some cases, your consent is implied if we ask you to provide personal information
with a stated purpose. For example, we can only deliver the product you have purchased
if you provide us with your address and phone number.</p>
<p><strong>
Your Express Consent</strong></p>
<p>
In other cases, we will ask you to give your express consent to use your personal
information to advise you of products or services that may be of interest. You always
have the opportunity to "opt out" of having your information used for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>
Withdrawing Your Consent</strong></p>
<p>
If you have "opted in" or subscribed to one of our newsletters or mailing lists,
we will always provide you the opportunity to "opt out" or unsubscribe. For example,
each e-mail we send you will tell you how to decline further e-mail.</p>
<h3>
Information BOATERexam.com<sup>®</sup> Collects from You</h3>
<p>
Listed here are some examples of the ways that we collect information about you
and how we use it.</p>
<p><strong>
On-Site Purchases</strong></p>
<p>
When you purchase a BOATERexam.com<sup>®</sup> product or service, you may need to provide
us with contact and payment information (such as credit card information) so that
we can process your request. Examples where we need contact information include
delivery of products, mailing of your Boater Education Card, and rebate requests.
If we collect this information, we may also ask for your consent to use this information
to send you promotional information on products and services.</p>
<p><strong>Our Web Sites</strong></p>
<p>
While using our Web Sites, you may be asked to voluntarily provide certain personal
information (such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number,
or credit card information). We use this information to complete your transaction
and to apply for access to certain special features and functions of the Web Sites.
If you choose not to provide requested personal information, you will not be able
to use certain features of the Web Sites and you will not be able to engage in transactions
through the Web Sites.</p>
<p>
With any of the services on our Web Sites, we may also use your personal information
to contact and correspond with you and to respond to your inquiries. With your consent,
we may send to you, from time to time, email or other communications regarding goods
or services we believe will interest you.</p>
<p>
All references to our Web Site in this Policy means www.BOATERexam.com<sup>®</sup>/usa/</p>
<p><strong>
Sign-Up for Newsletters or Updates</strong></p>
<p>
BOATERexam.com<sup>®</sup> also offers an e-newsletter. You can choose to subscribe by visiting
our Web Sites or when visiting us at a special event. To enroll, we will collect your contact
information (such as name and e-mail address). This information will only be used
to send you the newsletter.
</p>
<p><strong>
Participate in a Contest, Promotion, or Survey</strong></p>
<p>
From time to time, we may run contests, promotions, or surveys. If you participate,
you may be asked for contact information as well as additional optional survey information
(for example, product preferences). Information from contest entries will be used
to contact you if you win. We may also summarize survey information in a manner
that no longer identifies the contest entrants for analysis, but will not share
personal information from entries. All contests are subject to rules that will be
available with each particular contest.</p>
<h3>
Information BOATERexam.com<sup>®</sup> collects Automatically</h3>
<p>
Like many other Web sites, we automatically collect certain non-personal information
regarding Web site users that does not identify you. Examples include the Internet
Protocol (IP) address of your computer, the IP address of your Internet Service
Provider, the date and time you access the Web Site, the Internet address of the
Web site from which you linked directly to the Web Site, the operating system you
are using, the sections of the Web Site you visit, the Web Site pages read and images
viewed, and the content you download from the Web Site.</p>
<p>
This non-personal information is used for Web Site and system administration purposes
and to improve the Web Site.</p>
<p><strong>
Cookies</strong></p>
<p>
The Web Site uses "cookies", a technology that installs a small amount of information
on a Web Site user's computer to permit the Web Site to recognize future visits
using that computer. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the Web Site. For
example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a
previous user of the Web Site (so you do not have to enter your billing information
every time), to offer personalized Web page content and information for your use,
to track your activity at the Web Site, to respond to your needs, and to otherwise
 facilitate your Web Site experience. You may choose to decline cookies if your browser
permits, but doing so may affect your use of the Web Site and your ability to access
certain features of the Web Site or engage in transactions through the Web Site.</p>
<p>The Web Site uses third party display advertising networks to collect visitor data
and then serve targeted display ads back to these visitors when browsing other web sites.
Our partners use technology such as cookies and web beacons to collect this data.
For more information or to opt-out of this type of advertising,
please visit <a href="http://www.adroll.com/about/privacy">www.adroll.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>
Tracking Information</strong></p>
<p>
We may use non-personal information to compile tracking information reports regarding
Web Site user demographics, Web Site traffic patterns, and Web Site purchases, and
then provide those reports to advertisers and others. None of the tracking information
in the reports can be connected to the identities or other personal information
of individual users. We may also link tracking information with personal information
voluntarily provided by Web Site users. Once such a link is made, all of the linked
information is treated as personal information and will be used and disclosed only
in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<h3>
Links to Other Web Sites</h3>
<p>
Our Web Site may contain links to other Web sites or Internet resources. When you
click on one of those links you are contacting another Web site or Internet resource.
BOATERexam.com<sup>®</sup> has no responsibility or liability for or control over those other
Web sites or Internet resources or their collection, use and disclosure of your
personal information.</p>
<p>
We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those other sites to learn how
they collect and use information about you.</p>
<h3>

your information with third parties acting on our behalf or as permitted or required

our requirements for continued retention of your information, for example, for billing,
audit, or warranty purposes, we will make every reasonable effort to honour your
