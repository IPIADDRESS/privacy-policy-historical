            <p>The <i>Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998</i>, 
              (<i>the Act</i>) provides the people of NSW with enforceable rights 
              in relation to the ways in which public sector agencies collect, 
              store, use and disclose personal information. The Office of the 
              Board of Studies is committed to complying with <i>the Act. </i>Accordingly, 
              all personal information collected now or in the future will be 
              administered in accordance with <i>the Act</i>.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this management plan is to </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Identify personal information collected by the Office of the

            <h3>2.2&nbsp; Information Protection Principles (IPPs)</h3>
            <p>The Information Protection Principles are 12 general principles 
              that are set out in sections 8 and 9 of <i>the Act.</i> They set 
              the privacy standards which the Office of the Board of Studies and 
              all other public sector agencies are expected to follow when dealing 
              with personal information.</p>
            <p>The information protection principles establish standards for collecting 
              and dealing with personal information so as to minimise the risk 
              of misuse of that information. The principles also allow individuals 
              to exercise a reasonable degree of control over what happens to 
              their own personal information.</p>
            <p>The Information Protection Principles and their intent are as follows</p>
            <b> 
            <p>Principle 1 (s. 8)&nbsp; Collection of personal information for 
              lawful purposes</p>
            </b> 
            <p>This principle makes it clear that all personal information must 
              be collected for purposes which are not only lawful, but which also 
              directly relate to a function or activity of the Office.</p>
            <b> 
            <p>Principle 2 (s. 9) Collection of personal information directly 
              from the individual</p>
            </b> 
            <p>This principle is designed to limit the collection of personal 
              information where the individual concerned is not aware that this 
              is occurring.</p>
            <b> 
            <p>Principle 3 (s. 10) Requirements when collecting personal information</p>
            </b> 
            <p>This principle aims to ensure that when people are asked to provide 
              their personal information to a public sector agency they are given 
              enough information in order to exercise any rights that they may 
              have under <i>the Act</i>.</p>
            <b> 
            <p>Principle 4 (s. 11) Other requirements relating to collection of 
              personal information</p>
            </b> 
            <p>The Office must take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal 
              information collected from an individual is accurate and that the 
              way it is collected does not unreasonably intrude on the personal 
              affairs of the individual to whom it relates. </p>
            <b> 
            <p>Principle 5 (s. 12) Retention and security of personal information</p>
            </b> 
            <p>This principle sets out standards for the storage of personal information 
              once it has been collected, including the need to comply with the 
              provisions of the <i>State Records Act 1998</i>, and in particular 
              the disposal of records. The Office’s legal or administrative 
              accountability when deciding whether to dispose of personal information 
              must also be considered.</p>
            <p>The level of security that may be appropriate very much depends 
              on the nature of the personal information and the medium in which 
              it is stored.</p>
            <p>Section 12 places an obligation on agencies which transfer personal 
              information to outside parties to ensure that this information is 
              not used or disclosed inappropriately. This section will generally 
              apply where an agency transfers personal information to an outside 
              person or organisation for the performance of a service to the agency.</p>
            <p>The idea behind this principle is that a person who has dealings 
              with an agency should not lose their protection under <i>the Act</i> 
              simply because their personal information is held by an organisation 
              acting in a contractual or agency capacity to the public sector 
              agency.</p>
            <b> 
            <p>Principle 6 (s. 13) Information about personal information held 
              by agencies</p>
            </b> 
            <p>This principle is designed to alert people to the fact that an 
              agency holds personal information. It also allows people to find 
              out if any of the personal information held by the agency relates 
              to them. It is an important principle in that people can properly 
              exercise their rights under <i>the Act</i> only when they know which 
              agencies hold their personal information.</p>
            <b> 
            <p>Principle 7 (s. 14) Access to personal information held by agencies</p>
            </b> 
            <p>This principle allows people a right of access to their personal 
              information which may be held by public sector agencies. While the 
              section appears to be quite straightforward it is complicated by 
              its interaction with the <i>Freedom of Information Act</i>. Section 
              20(5) states that those provisions of the <i>Freedom of Information 
              Act 1989</i> which impose conditions or limitations on the provision 
              of information are imported into the <i>Privacy and Personal Information 
              Protection Act.</i></p>
            <b> 
            <p>Principle 8 (s. 15) Alteration of personal information</p>
            </b> 
            <p>Section 15 builds upon section 14 and provides a right to either 
              amend or to attach a statement to personal information which a person 
              believes to be incorrect or inappropriate.</p>
            <p>Generally agencies cannot delete information contained within their 
              records systems due to the operation of the <i>State Records Act 
              1998</i>. Section 15 of the <i>Privacy and Personal Information 
              Protection Act</i> allows an agency to delete information from their 
              records system in some cases.</p>
            <p>Section 15 is in part designed to give the subject of the data 
              some control over personal information that may be held about them. 
              In this regard s. 15(2) offers a person the right to have their 
              say on the face of the record. </p>
            <b> 
            <p>Principle 9 (s. 16) Agency must check accuracy of personal information 
              before use</p>
            </b> 
            <p>Section 16 places an obligation on agencies to try to ensure that 
              all personal information used by them is relevant and accurate.</p>
            <b> </b> 
            <p>Where an agency relies on information collected by other agencies 
              to make decisions, s. 16 would require that adequate standards for 
              data exchange be introduced to ensure that the information means 
              the same thing in both agencies.</p>
            <b> 
            <p>Principle 10 (s. 17) Limits on use of personal information</p>
            </b> 
            <p>This principle places limits on the uses an agency can make of 
              any personal information that it collects or holds. It generally 
              restricts use to the purpose for which the information was collected 
              unless consent is obtained for other uses.</p>
            <p>Agencies that breach the information protection principles are 
              subject to internal review under <i>the Act</i>. Thus, if an agency 
              plans to use personal information for a purpose not directly related 
              to the purpose for collection it will not only need to obtain consent 
              from the person to whom the information relates, it will also need 
              evidence of that consent to protect itself from future action.</p>
            <b> 
            <p>Principle 11 (s. 18) Limits on disclosure of personal information</p>
            </b> 
            <p>This principle makes a general rule that personal information should 
              be disclosed only for purposes directly related to the purposes 
              for which the information was collected. This general rule then 
              has a number of exceptions contained within the principle.</p>
            <p>A directly related purpose is a purpose that is very closely related 
              to the purpose for collection. This would be the type of situation 
              that people would quite reasonably expect to occur with their personal 
              information.</p>
            <b> 
            <p>Principle 12 (s. 19) Special restrictions on disclosure of personal 
              information</p>
            </b> 
            <p>There are two distinct parts to s. 19. The first part deals with 
              a number of categories of sensitive information, which are subject 
              to more stringent disclosure requirements than those that apply 
              to other kinds of personal information under s. 18.</p>
            <p>The first part combines a recognition that these kinds of information 
              cover areas of personal life which are not usually appropriate matters 
              of official interest together with a concern that their disclosure 
              could result in uses which are prejudicial to the individuals concerned.</p>
            <p>The second part of s. 19 places restrictions on disclosure of personal 
              information to persons or bodies outside New South Wales.</p>

            <h3>2.3&nbsp; Privacy Codes of Practice</h3>
            </b> 
            <p>If a public sector agency believes that the information protection 
              principles are unworkable in a particular circumstance, it can either 
              make a Privacy Code of Practice or seek an exemption from, or modification 
              to, the principle from the Privacy Commissioner.</p>
            <p>Privacy Codes of Practice allow an agency to modify one or more 
              of the information protection principles. Codes of Practice can 
              be made in relation to one of three things:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>A particular type of personal information (s. 29(5)(a))</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A particular organisation or type of organisation (s. 29(5)(b))</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>For a type of activity (s. 29(5)(c))</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>A Privacy Code of Practice can change or delete any of the information 
              protection principles but it cannot change or delete any of the 
              exceptions to the principles, nor can it increase the level of privacy 
              protection above that of the information protection principles.</p>
            <h3>2.4&nbsp; Other legal requirements affecting privacy</h3>
            <p>In developing the Office’s response to its obligations under 
              the <i>Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998</i>

              the Board of Studies</h3>
            <p>In order to carry out its functions as described in section 3 of 
              this document, the Office collects the following classes of information:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> <b>Personnel records (Office staff). </b><br>
                Personnel records are maintained by the Human Resources Unit in 
                both paper file and electronic format. The information recorded 
                in these files includes: name, address and next of kin details, 
                bank account details, tax file number, EEO information (provision 
                of which is voluntary). All personal information is collected 
                from employees, or, where provided by another organisation, for 
                entitlement purposes, has been authorised by the officer. Officers 
                can access their personnel information upon request to the Human 
                Resources Unit.            </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li> 
                <p><b>Personnel records (casual staff)</b><br>
                  including seasonal clerical staff, examination markers, presiding 
                  officers and supervisors and committee members, name and address 
                  details, bank account details and tax file numbers. The applicants 
                  provide all information. Applications for membership on committees 
                  or as examiners/markers require the endorsement of the School 
                  Principal/Director. Applicants are aware of this requirement, 
                  and that the Office will not accept the application without 
                  such endorsement. The original application form is retained, 
                as is an electronic record. </p>
              </li>
              <li> 
                <p><b>Student records</b><br>
                  60% of student records are submitted on-line by schools, negating 
                  the need to retain paper records within the Office for those 
                  students. Schools submitting information on-line, retain the 
                  paper records. All data is held on the Office’s exam system 
                  in electronic form. Information held includes name, home address 
                  (for HSC candidates only), date of birth, school attended, and 
                  ethnicity and disability data. During the life of a record, 
                  assessment data and examination mark data are added to the record. 
                  Additional information provided to the Office in terms of Special 
                  Provisions (collected from the student and where applicable 
                  treating doctors, with the knowledge of the student) and Illness/Misadventure 
                  appeals are also held where an application for these provisions 
                is made. </p>
              </li>
              <li> 
                <p>Students undertaking practical examinations and /or languages 
                  are also required to provide a passport sized photograph for 
                  identification purposes. These photo ID’s are provided 
                  to the practical examiner, and to the presiding officer for 
                  languages examinations. At the completion of the examinations, 
                  the photographs are destroyed by either the school principal, 
                  or this Office if they are returned.</p>
