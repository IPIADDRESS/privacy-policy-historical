<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

At botid.org, we are committed to protecting online user privacy. This "Privacy Policy" discloses the privacy practices governing our knowing collection, use, and disclosure of information. In order to ensure your privacy, information we collect is used only in the manner and for the purposes described below.
<br><br>
Anonymous User Information: botid.org collects some anonymous information each time you visit botid.org so we can improve the overall quality of your online experience. We collect your IP address, referral data, and browser and platform type. You do not have to register with botid.org before we can collect this anonymous information. We do not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, e-mail address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. botid.org does not require you to share information that identifies you personally, such as your name or email address, in order for you to use the botid.org search. botid.org assigns an anonymous ID number to your requests and links the following additional data to that number: the date and time you visited botid.org, your search terms, and the links upon which you choose to click. Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files to collect and store this anonymous user information. We analyze this information to examine trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. botid.org may present links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed. We use this information to understand and improve the quality of the botid.org search. 
<br><br>
Cookies: We use a feature of Internet web browsers called a "cookie," which is a small file that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. This enables us to store user preferences and track user trends and search patterns. We use cookies to improve the quality of the botid.org services and to better understand how users interact with us. We do not and cannot use Cookies to retrieve individual personally identifiable information about you from your computer unless you knowingly and willingly provided such information. The cookie technology we use cannot obtain information from your hard drive or pass on a computer virus. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some botid.org features or services may not function properly without cookies.
