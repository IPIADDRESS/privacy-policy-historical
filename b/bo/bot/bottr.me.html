    </ul>

    <p class="mainTermsHead"><strong>2. Why we collect your information?</strong></p>

    <p class="mainTermsHead"><strong>3. With whom we share your information?</strong></p>

    <p>
        We neither rent nor sell your Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. However, we do share your Personal Information with third parties as described below:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Third-party vendors:</strong> We employ third party vendors to provide Services on our behalf for varied purposes like business analytics, customer service, marketing, distribution etc. We may authorize such vendors to collect information on our behalf in order to operate features of our application or to deliver services tailored to your needs. We assure that such information used by third party vendors is only to perform their functions and they are not permitted to share or use that information for any other purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Companies within our corporate family:</strong> We may be required to provide information about you to our parent or subsidiary company or corporate affiliates. To the extent our parent company or subsidiaries or corporate affiliates have information about you, they will follow the best practices as described in this Privacy Policy when using it.</li>

If you choose to access these optional services provided by our Business Partners, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with those Partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party Business Partners.</li>
        <li><strong>User Profiles and Submissions:</strong> Certain user profile information, including without limitation a user’s name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for Company’s services. Your account privacy settings allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by others. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments.

In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</li>
        <li><strong>Government Bodies:</strong> We may disclose your Personal Information and Usage Information as and when required in response to a sub-poena, court order, government demand or to comply with any legal requirements for protecting our interest. We will contact you by e-mail when we have to adhere to such legal request. All communications sent by us at such email address shall be deemed to have been communicated to you.</li>

    <p>
        Our Services are directed to serve a very general audience. We reserve a right of use of our Services to persons above 13 years of age.
