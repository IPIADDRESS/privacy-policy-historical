<div class="text">
<div class="bose-richText  ">
<p>We may use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics, Crashlytics, Mixpanel, Flurry, Brightcove and Bazaarvoice) on our Services to collect and analyse usage information through cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; and provide certain features to you. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by <a class="bose-link" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">clicking here</a>. We may also use Adobe Analytics to analyse and optimise the performance of our websites, advertising and content.

<h3 class="bose-title -left   -none">
2. Online advertising
</h3>
</div>
<div class="text">
<div class="bose-richText  ">
<p>The Services may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as on other websites that you visit and other applications that you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="text">
<div class="bose-richText  ">
<p>Third parties, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services, may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone or other device to collect information about you as discussed above. We also allow other third parties (e.g. ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access the Services. We sometimes provide our customer information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may "match" this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="text">
<div class="bose-richText  ">
<p>We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on the device that you use to access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the <a class="bose-link" href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, the <a class="bose-link" href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, or <a class="bose-link" href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">Your Online Choices</a> to opt out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programmes. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customise Google display network ads, visit the <a class="bose-link" href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Google Ads Settings page</a>. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programmes.

</div>
</div>
<div class="text">

3. Mobile advertising
</h3>
</div>
<div class="text">
<div class="bose-richText  ">
<p>When using mobile applications from Bose or others, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. We may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalised in-application advertisements; thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements.</p>

HOW WE SHARE AND DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION
</h2>
</div>
<div class="text">
<div class="bose-richText  ">
<p>Bose will share your information in the following ways:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="text">
<div class="bose-richText  ">
<ul><li><strong><em>Affiliates and subsidiaries.</em></strong> We may share information that we collect within the Bose family of companies (e.g. Bose's manufacturing, distribution and product development companies) to deliver products and services to you, ensure a consistent level of service across our products and Services, and enhance our products, services and your customer experience.</li><li><strong><em>Service providers.</em></strong> We provide access to or share your information with select third parties who perform services on our behalf. They have access to perform these services but are prohibited from using your information for other purposes. They provide a variety of services to us, including billing, sales, marketing, product content and features (e.g. voice activation/recognition services), advertising, analytics, research, customer service, delivery and fulfilment, data storage, security, fraud prevention, payment processing and legal services. Such parties currently include crash and bug analytics providers like Crashlytics, and service providers like Segment that enable us to connect your Bose products to your device and provide us with analytics for internal purposes.</li><li><strong><em>Music streaming services.</em></strong> When you initiate a connection with a third-party streaming service through the Services, we will share information about you that is required to enable delivery of the third-party content (e.g. your streaming service log-in credentials).</li><li><strong><em>Protection of Bose and others.</em></strong> By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that we may access, retain and disclose the information that we collect and maintain about you if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, retention or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process (e.g. a subpoena or court order); (b) enforce our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy or other contracts with you, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; and/or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Bose, its agents and affiliates, its users and/or the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection, spam/malware prevention, and similar purposes.</li><li><strong><em>Business transfers.</em></strong> As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies. In such transactions, (including in contemplation of such transactions) user information may be among the transferred assets. If a portion or all of Bose's assets are sold or transferred to a third party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets. If such transfer is subject to additional mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, Bose will comply with such restrictions.</li><li><strong><em>Bose Learning Hub.</em></strong> If you use the Bose Learning Hub in connection with your employment, we may share information about the training modules and other activities in which you participate and complete through the Learning Hub and based on our applicable agreement with your employer.</li><li><strong><em>Bose Ventures.</em></strong> If you submit information to Bose Ventures in connection with seeking potential funding for your business concept, we may share information with other investors, funds and angel groups in our sole and absolute discretion in connection with facilitating a possible investment in your business.</li><li><strong><em>Public forums.</em></strong> Certain features of our Services make it possible for you to share comments publicly with other users. Any information that you submit through such features is not confidential, and may use it for any purpose (including in testimonials or other Bose marketing materials). For example, if you submit a product review on one of our sites, we may display your review (along with the name provided, if any) on other Bose websites and on third-party websites. Moreover, some of the Services may allow you to share information publicly with other users so that they may benefit from it (e.g. sharing the sound frequency of a music venue). Any information you post openly in these ways will be available to the public at large and potentially accessible through third-party search engines. Accordingly, please take care when using these features.</li><li><strong><em>Aggregate/anonymous information.</em></strong> From time to time, Bose may share aggregate/anonymous information about the use of the Services, such as by publishing a report on usage trends. The sharing of such data is unrestricted.</li></ul>
