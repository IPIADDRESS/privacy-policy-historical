This collected data is not being linked to any other device-related information. We use the identification numbers only to provide you with customized commercials and to evaluate your usage. If you activate the option “no Ad-Tracking” in the iOS settings in “privacy” – “advertising”, or in Android choose the option “opt out of interest-based ads” under “Google Settings” under “ Ads”, we can only conduct the following measures: measurement of your interaction with banners by counting the number of displays of a banner without being clicked on (“frequency capping”), click rate, detection of unique usage (“unique user”) and security measures, anit-fraud and elimination of errors. You can delete the IDFA or the Advertising ID in your device settings at any time (“set back Ad-ID”), then a new identification number will be created, which is not being linked to the previously collected data. We point out that it is possible that you might not be able to use all the functions of our App if you restrict the use of the aforementioned identification number. </span>
