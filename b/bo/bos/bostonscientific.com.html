    <h1>Web Site Privacy Policy for the United States </h1>
  

 <!-- display the main part of the section data -->
  
    <p>This Privacy Policy (Policy) sets forth the Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC, we, or us) policies regarding the collection and use of information relating to the BSC web site located at www.bostonscientific.com (Site). When we refer to BSC, we or us, we mean Boston Scientific Corporation, including our affiliates and subsidiaries.
Certain areas of the Site contain information intended only for licensed medical professionals. Accordingly, BSC reserves the right to limit certain areas of the Site to those persons who register and meet the qualifications imposed by us. This Policy addresses our privacy practices relating to general and registered use of our Site by visitors located within the United States. 
</p><p>
</p><h2>Information We Collect and How We Use It </h2>
<p>Personally identifiable information (Personal Information) is information that can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, email address, telephone number or similar information. BSC only collects Personal Information that you choose to share with us, such as when (1) contacting us via the Site (by clicking on the "Contact" button at the top of each web page), (2) submitting your resume online in response to a job posting, (3) registering online for an event or course or, (4) upon registration for access to those areas of our Site intended only for licensed medical professionals. </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><i>Registered Users </i></p>
          <p>If you are a licensed medical professional, to register, you must provide us with certain Personal Information, including your name, profession, email address, postal mail address, title and clinical affiliation. We will use this Personal Information to review and verify your registration information. We may use your Personal Information to send periodic marketing or promotional notices to you or notify you of any changes to this Policy. You can always opt-out of receiving these communications from us by following the "opt-out" procedures described below. </p>
          <p><i>Resume Submission</i></p>
          <p>If your Personal Information is submitted through the Site when applying for a position with BSC, your Personal Information will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating you for the position. We may retain your Personal Information for a period of time, but only for the purpose of considering your application for current or future positions at BSC. This information may be shared within BSC as well as with third party service providers contracted by us to collect and maintain candidate submissions for job postings. </p>
          <p><i>Contacting BSC </i></p>
          <p>If you contact BSC via the Site, we will only use your Personal Information contained in your email to respond to your specific inquiry or comments in the email. We may retain your email for a period of time, but will not use any of your Personal Information for any purpose other than responding to your email. </p>
          <p><i>General Information and Accuracy </i></p>
          <p>Any information you provide to BSC must be true, accurate, current, non-misleading, and consistent and relevant for the purpose for which you are providing the information. If you are a registered user, you must have the authority to provide the information submitted to and through the Site, and understand and agree that we may from time to time verify such authority. </p>
          <p><i>Usage Data </i></p>
          <p>The Site automatically tracks certain information about your behavior while visiting the Site. The information gathered includes only the URL from which you accessed this Site, and which URL you visit next. We collect and store this aggregate information in order to measure the Site's performance and improve the Site's design and functionality. We may also share this aggregate information with third parties to illustrate how the Site is used and for other marketing purposes. If you are a registered user, we may use your Usage Data with or without your Personal Information, in order to measure the Site's performance and improve the Site's design and functionality. We may also share this aggregate information with third parties to illustrate how the Site is used and for other marketing purposes.We may use your Personal Information to improve our marketing efforts, statistically evaluate site usage, improve our Site or customize our Site's content, layout and services. See also "Cookies", below. </p>
          <p><i>Cookies and Clear Gifs </i></p>
          <p>BSC uses both "session" and "persistent" cookies on this Site. A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser and stored in your computer's hard drive. The purpose of a cookie is to remember certain user inputs on the Site. Personalization features also use cookies to identify groups of users and deliver appropriate Site content and services, as well as feedback related to marketing and email campaigns. </p>
          <p>Session cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. They store information on your computer for a number of reasons, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (i.e., username and password), helping to determine what areas of the Site you find most valuable, and customizing the Site based on your preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent cookies placed on your computer by this Site may hold Personal Information, but only if you are a registered user or have otherwise consented to the provision of Personal Information in accordance with the terms of this Policy. Otherwise, the Site's server only knows that an unidentified visitor with your cookies has returned to the Site. In addition to customization, persistent cookies will be used to provide you with better service on the Site, to compile and analyze statistics and trends, and to otherwise administer and improve the Site for your use. Subject to applicable law and in accordance with the terms of this Policy, information gathered through the use of persistent cookies on the Site may also be shared with, or sold to, third parties.
          </p>
          <p>The Site may also use clear gifs (also known as web beacons) in combination with cookies, in order to help Site operators understand how visitors interact with the Site. A clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel by 1 pixel in size) that is placed on the Site, which allows the Site to measure the actions of a visitor who opens the page that contains the clear gif. BSC uses clear gifs to measure traffic and related behavior, and to improve your experience when visiting the Site. We also use clear gifs to manage the content available on the Site.
          </p>
          <p>BSC contracts with a number of third party service providers who use cookie technology to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information, and monitor responses to email and advertising campaigns on behalf of BSC. The information obtained from cookies is used by BSC, and in certain cases by its third party service providers, to administer the Site, improve the quality of your experience when visiting, and monitor the efficacy of BSC's marketing activities. Data collected by any such third party from this Site is owned and used by BSC, but is accessible by such third party administrators. To read the privacy policies of BSC's third party providers, please visit <a href="http://www.omniture.com/privacy/policy">http://www.omniture.com/privacy/policy </a> and <a href="http://www.avenuea-razorfish.com/">http://www.avenuea-razorfish.com/ </a>.
          </p>
          <p>Cookies do not damage your computer, and as deployed by BSC, cannot be used to discover your identity. You can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is being sent to your computer. This will notify you whether or not you are required to accept the cookie in order to view certain Site content, and allows you to decide if you want to accept the cookie or not. You can also set your browser to accept all cookies or to refuse cookies altogether. If you do prevent your computer from accepting cookies, you will still be able to fully access the Site, although you may lose some additional functionality and convenience provided through the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please search for "cookie" in the Help portion of your web browser.</p></blockquote>

In some cases, these Other Sites are made available via "framing technology", and may appear to be part of this Site. However, prior to accessing Other Sites or non-BSC content via the BSC Site, a dialogue box will inform you that you are about to leave the Site, and will prompt you for your consent to proceed Although some of the entities controlling these framed sites are under contract with BSC, we urge you to familiarize yourself with the individual privacy and other terms for each linked or framed site prior to submitting your Personal Information.
