<p><i>Usage Data </i><br>
The Site automatically tracks certain information about your behavior while visiting the Site. The information gathered includes the URL from which you accessed this Site, and which URL you visit next. We collect and store this aggregate information in order to measure the Site's performance and improve the Site's design and functionality. We may also share this aggregate information with third parties to illustrate how the Site is used and for other marketing purposes.
</p><p>If you are a registered user, we may use your Usage Data with or without your personal data, in order to measure the Site's performance and improve the Site's design and functionality. We may share aggregate Usage Data with third parties to illustrate how the Site is used and for other marketing purposes. See also "Cookies", below.</p> 
<p><i>Cookies </i><br>
BSC uses both "session" and "persistent" cookies on this Site. A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser and stored in your computer's hard drive. The purpose of a cookie is to remember certain user inputs on the Site. Personalization features also use cookies to identify groups of users and deliver appropriate Site content and services, as well as feedback related to marketing and email campaigns. </p>
<p>Session cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. They store information on your computer for a number of reasons, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (i.e., username and password), helping to determine what areas of the Site you find most valuable, and customizing the Site based on your preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent cookies placed on your computer by this Site may hold personal data, but only if you are a registered user or have otherwise consented to the provision of personal data in accordance with the terms of this Policy. Personal data would be used for things like simplifying the login process or serving personalized content on the site. Otherwise, the Site's server only knows that an unidentified visitor with your cookies has returned to the Site. In addition to customization, persistent cookies will be used to provide you with better service on the Site, to compile and analyze statistics and trends, and to otherwise administer and improve the Site for your use. Subject to applicable law and in accordance with the terms of this Policy, information gathered through the use of persistent cookies on the Site may also be shared with third parties who assist us with the management or optimization of our Sites and the delivery of enhanced user experience.</p>
         <p>Cookies do not damage your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is being sent to your computer. This will notify you whether or not you are required to accept the cookie in order to view certain Site content, and allows you to decide if you want to accept the cookie or not. You can also set your browser to accept all cookies or to refuse cookies altogether. If you do prevent your computer from accepting cookies, you will still be able to fully access the Site, although you may lose some additional functionality and convenience provided through the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please search for "cookie" in the Help portion of your web browser.</p>
<p><i>3rd Party Tracking</i><br>
The use of cookies by our third parties is covered by our privacy policy.  We may not always have access or control over these cookies, however the third parties act on our behalf.  Our third parties use session ID cookies to track certain information about your behavior while visiting the Site, to facilitate surveys, and to identify groups of users and deliver appropriate Site content and services, as well as feedback related to marketing and email campaigns. Our third parties employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage Usage Data. We do not tie the information gathered to your personal data.
</p>
<p><i>Social Media Widgets</i><br>
Our Site may include widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. This feature may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.  Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with this feature are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 
</p>
<p><i>Clear Gifs</i><br>
The Site may also use clear gifs (also known as web beacons) in combination with cookies, in order to help Site operators understand how visitors interact with the Site. A clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel by 1 pixel in size) that is placed on the Site, which allows the Site to measure the actions of a visitor who opens the page that contains the clear gif. BSC uses clear gifs to measure traffic and related behavior, and to improve your experience when visiting the Site. We also use clear gifs to manage the content available on the Site. Clear gifs are not tied to personal data.</p>

<ul><li>To unaffiliated third parties that are under contract to perform services for or on behalf of BSC. Examples of such services are third parties 1) maintain our computer databases;  and 2) perform marketing activities; </li>
<li>To other persons as permitted by applicable law or regulation; and </li>
<li>To law enforcement personnel and agencies, or as part of a legal process, in order to protect our property or in furtherance of an investigation regarding a breach of the Site rules and policies, unauthorized access to or use of the Site or any other illegal activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any access to such information will be limited to the purpose for which such information was provided to our affiliate, subsidiary or third party. Our affiliates, subsidiaries and third parties may be located throughout the world. Accordingly, information may be sent worldwide to countries which provide varying levels of privacy protection.

<h3>Other Web Sites</h3>
This Policy applies only to BSC Sites that link to this privacy policy. This Site includes links to both our affiliated sites and to non-BSC web sites, including access to content, products and services of such affiliated and non-affiliated sites (Other Sites). In some cases, these Other Sites are made available via "framing technology", and may appear to be part of this Site. However, prior to accessing Other Sites or non-BSC content via the BSC Site, a dialogue box will inform you that you are about to leave the Site, and will prompt you for your consent to proceed. Although some of the entities controlling these framed sites are under contract with BSC, we urge you to familiarize yourself with the individual privacy and other terms for each linked or framed site prior to providing your personal data. All BSC Sites that are governed by this privacy policy will have a link to this document.
<h3>Security</h3>
BSC takes seriously the security of the information it collects. BSC has therefore implemented technology and security policies and procedures intended to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorized disclosure or access to, such information, reasonably appropriate to the nature of the data concerned.
<p>
When you enter sensitive information (such as personal health information), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to us through our Sites, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@bostonscientific.com?Subject=Security%20Question">webmaster@bostonscientific.com</a>.
