<p><em>Usage Data </em><br>The Site automatically tracks certain information about your behavior while visiting the Site. The information gathered includes the URL from which you accessed this Site, and which URL you visit next. We collect and store this aggregate information in order to measure the Site's performance and improve the Site's design and functionality. We may also share this aggregate information with third parties to illustrate how the Site is used and for other marketing purposes.</p>
<p>If you are a registered user, we may use your Usage Data with or without your personal data, in order to measure the Site's performance and improve the Site's design and functionality. We may share aggregate Usage Data with third parties to illustrate how the Site is used and for other marketing purposes. See also "Cookies", below.</p>
<p><em>Cookies </em><br>BSC uses both "session" and "persistent" cookies on this Site. A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser and stored in your computer's hard drive. The purpose of a cookie is to remember certain user inputs on the Site. Personalization features also use cookies to identify groups of users and deliver appropriate Site content and services, as well as feedback related to marketing and email campaigns.</p>
<p>Session cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. They store information on your computer for a number of reasons, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (i.e., username and password), helping to determine what areas of the Site you find most valuable, and customizing the Site based on your preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent cookies placed on your computer by this Site may hold personal data, but only if you are a registered user or have otherwise consented to the provision of personal data in accordance with the terms of this Policy. Personal data would be used for things like simplifying the login process or serving personalized content on the site. Otherwise, the Site's server only knows that an unidentified visitor with your cookies has returned to the Site. In addition to customization, persistent cookies will be used to provide you with better service on the Site, to compile and analyze statistics and trends, and to otherwise administer and improve the Site for your use. Subject to applicable law and in accordance with the terms of this Policy, information gathered through the use of persistent cookies on the Site may also be shared with third parties who assist us with the management or optimization of our Sites and the delivery of enhanced user experience.</p>
<p>Cookies do not damage your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is being sent to your computer. This will notify you whether or not you are required to accept the cookie in order to view certain Site content, and allows you to decide if you want to accept the cookie or not. You can also set your browser to accept all cookies or to refuse cookies altogether. If you do prevent your computer from accepting cookies, you will still be able to fully access the Site, although you may lose some additional functionality and convenience provided through the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please search for "cookie" in the Help portion of your web browser.</p>
<p><em>3rd Party Tracking</em><br>The use of cookies by our third parties is covered by our privacy policy. We may not always have access or control over these cookies, however the third parties act on our behalf. Our third parties use session ID cookies to track certain information about your behavior while visiting the Site, to facilitate surveys, and to identify groups of users and deliver appropriate Site content and services, as well as feedback related to marketing and email campaigns. Our third parties employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage Usage Data. We do not tie the information gathered to your personal data.</p>
<p><em>Social Media Widgets</em><br>Our Site may include widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. This feature may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with this feature are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
<p><em>Clear Gifs</em><br>The Site may also use clear gifs (also known as web beacons) in combination with cookies, in order to help Site operators understand how visitors interact with the Site. A clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel by 1 pixel in size) that is placed on the Site, which allows the Site to measure the actions of a visitor who opens the page that contains the clear gif. BSC uses clear gifs to measure traffic and related behavior, and to improve your experience when visiting the Site. We also use clear gifs to manage the content available on the Site. Clear gifs are not tied to personal data.</p>
<p><em>Flash LSOs</em><br>We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control, or display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit. Third parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.</p>
<p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, go to <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/">www.macromedia.com</a></p>
<p><em>Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting</em><br>We partner with a third party ad networks to either display advertising on our Web siteSite or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt out by clicking <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/">here</a>.
