</p><p>

</p><p>

Third party sites that are linked to Boston.com, such as Yahoo Personals and NewsBank, are governed by their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of websites to which Boston.com, Boston Globe Services or BostonWorks may link.
</p><p>
<strong><a name="gather">What information do we gather/track about you?</a></strong>
</p><p> 
<strong>Registration for our websites:</strong> There is a free registration process required to access the full range of information and services offered across our different websites (Boston.com, Boston Globe Services and BostonWorks.com). 
</p><p>
Boston.com requires that you supply a unique e-mail address and demographic information (zip code, age, sex; household income, job industry, and job title) in order to register. You must also agree to the terms of our <a href="http://www.boston.com/help/memberagreement/">Member Agreement</a>. 
</p><p>
Boston Globe Services requires that you supply your name, e-mail address, subscriber account number and/or a credit card number, and your phone number in order to transact with The Boston Globe (examples include managing your subscription or place an ad). 
</p><p>
BostonWorks.com has optional registration; all of the content on the site is available for all users regardless of membership status. Optional registration is required for users who would like to set up job alerts and post and send resumes and/or cover letters. Information required to register includes your e-mail address and first and last name. Additional information (such as city, state, education and job title) may be supplied in conjunction with posting a resume and/or creating a job application.
</p><p>
Boston Globe newspaper subscriber information: We generally obtain your name, address, telephone number, credit card number or other billing information in order to process your subscription request. As a subscriber, we request that you also provide us with your e-mail address.
</p><p>
<strong>Premium Products and Services:</strong>  While the majority of our websites are offered free of charge, we do charge fees for select premium products and services. These products include access to Boston Globe archives (1979-present) on Boston.com and recent home sales reports in the Boston.com real estate section. To enable the purchase of recent home reports, Boston.com collects and stores billing and credit card information. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction and otherwise agree to keep the information confidential. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments. 
</p><p>
The Boston Globe archives (1979-present) is hosted by NewsBank (a third party vendor), and all purchases are processed by NewsBank on behalf of Boston.com. NewsBank collects and stores billing and credit card information solely to process these purchases. NewsBank has agreed that this information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction and otherwise agree to keep the information confidential. 
</p><p>
We also collect and store billing and credit card information where required for certain purchase transactions (such as paying for a newspaper subscription). This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction and agree to otherwise keep the information confidential. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.
</p><p>
You must supply personal information, including billing address, phone number and credit card information in order to make a purchase at the online Boston Globe Store or if you are posting a job on BostonWorks. This information is only used to complete the transaction or purchase, and is not shared with other companies or with third parties. 
</p><p>

<strong>Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers:</strong> On occasion, the New England Media Group also collects personal information from registered members or subscribers in connection with optional sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information is to be shared with a third party other than the New England Media Group we will notify you at the time of collection.   If you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer.
</p><p>
<strong>Special Events and Promotions:</strong> We often receive information regarding customers who may also attend Special Events and Promotions. Such information will be used as indicated at the time of collection. 
</p><p>
<strong>Reader Surveys and Market Research:</strong> Reader surveys and market research are valuable tools that help us better respond to consumer needs and opinions and help shape our product offerings.  
</p><p>
<strong>Online Customer Panels:</strong> We offer readers and customers the opportunity to participate in online research panels. These customers agree to participate in periodic surveys about their usage of products produced by The New England Media Group, their household/personal characteristics and their purchase behavior. Panel members are primarily contacted via e-mail, but may occasionally be contacted by telephone or postal mail. All survey data is reported/used in aggregate form only, and no personally identifiable information is released. As a panel member, we require that you supply us with your e-mail address only; name, home address and telephone number are optional.
</p><p>
<strong>Online surveys:</strong> Our websites may collect additional personal information from members in connection with optional reader surveys and market research activities. Information that you provide in answer to optional reader survey or market research questions may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection. 
</p><p>
<strong>Cookies:</strong> Our websites employ cookies to recognize you and your access privileges on Boston.com, Boston Globe Services and Bostonworks.com, as well as to track site usage. For detailed information about our use of cookies see our <a href="http://www.boston.com/help/cookie_faq/">Frequently Asked Questions about Cookies</a>.
</p><p>
Boston.com and BostonWorks.com use a commercial advertising server (currently 24/7 Real Media) to display ads on our site. In addition, advertisers may elect to use third-party advertising companies to serve ads onto our websites. In the course of serving these advertisements, the third party advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain. 
</p><p>
We also reserve the right to place a New York Times Company cookie on your computer with a unique anonymous number to ensure that your browser does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads in a series, and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a particular ad or visited a particular Web page.
</p><p>
<strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs):</strong> Third party advertisers may also use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs/action tags) to help better manage advertising on our site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. Clear gifs may ping or alert the advertiser's server about the online movements of Web users. For instance, advertisers may place a clear gif allowing them to recognize an existing cookie on your browser if from the same service. The main difference between cookies and clear gifs is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Please keep in mind that we do not have access to any information collected by these clear gifs nor additional information they may be tied to by the advertiser. 
</p><p>
Please click here to see a list of these commercial and advertising agencies and their privacy policies.  If you would like more information about your option not to accept cookies or clear gifs placed by these companies, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">here</a>.
</p><p>

<strong>Usage Data:</strong>  Our websites have currently contracted with Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our visitors. We use this information to track the site's traffic, usability, performance, and effectiveness. All data collected by Omniture on behalf of our websites is owned and used by the New England Media Group.  We reserve the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding our online visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers. Please note that this is not personal information, only general summaries of the activities of our visitors and customers in aggregate.  Omniture uses cookies to help track visitor behavior and sets cookies on behalf of our websites, which will be listed under the domain 2O7. For more information about Omniture's privacy policy, including how to opt out, go to  <a href="http://www.omniture.com/policy.html">www.omniture.com/policy.html</a>
</p><p>
Our websites are currently contracted with Tacoda Systems, a third party, to track and analyze anonymous usage and browsing patterns from our visitors and customers. All data collected by Tacoda on behalf of our websites is owned and used by the New England Media Group alone. We use this information to help provide our advertisers with more targeted advertising opportunities, which means that users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. For more information about Tacoda’s privacy policy, including how to opt out, go to <a href="http://www.tacoda.com/privacy_policy.htm">www.tacoda.com/privacy_policy.htm</a>
</p><p>
We reserve the right to change the vendors who provide it with usage data.
</p><p>
<strong>IP Addresses:</strong> Our websites log IP addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We use IP address logs in an aggregate fashion to track access to our site (by domain type, for example), but we do not use IP address logs to track your session or your behavior on our site. 
</p><p>
<strong>Log Files:</strong> Log data is only used in aggregate to analyze usage of our websites. 
</p><p>
<strong><a name="do">What do we do with the information we track?</a></strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Site Login:</strong> Your e-mail address acts as your member login, and together with the password that you create during the registration process your e-mail address allows you to access many of the features and services on available on our websites.
</p><p>
Boston.com, BostonWorks.com and the Boston Globe Services website will share your e-mail address and password with each other in order to allow you to use the same login and password on each of the three sites. This means that you will be able to move back and forth on our websites without having to create a new membership account or remember a separate password for each site. 
</p><p>
<strong>Statistical Analysis and Banner Advertising:</strong> Our websites may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. We also use demographic and preference information to allow advertising on our websites to be targeted, in aggregate, to the users for whom they are most pertinent. This means that users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. In both statistical analyses and banner advertisement targeting, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form. 
</p><p>
<strong>E-Mail Newsletters:</strong> During the registration process, you will have the opportunity to choose to receive periodic e-mails. You may also sign up to receive e-mails at any time by accessing your profile in the Member Center section. We send both editorial e-mail newsletters (news headlines, breaking news alerts, etc.) and e-mail about services offered by The New England Media Group and its partners and advertisers. 
</p><p>
<strong>Programs From Our Partners:</strong> During the registration process, new users who select to register for certain featured offers from our partners will begin receiving e-mail from these companies. You will only receive e-mail messages from these companies if you elect this opt-in service. If you elect to opt-out of an e-mail from a partner, you must do so through that partner directly. The New England Media Group may use this information as set forth in this privacy policy.
