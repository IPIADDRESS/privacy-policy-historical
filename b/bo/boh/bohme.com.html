<p>Other information you provide is not required by us but may assist with responding to your request more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Collect Personal Information?</strong><br> Bohme offers various products and services to our Customers and also strives to meet the needs of our Customers.&nbsp; We use your Personal Information for internal purposes such as tracking your order, analyzing your preferences, and noting trends and statistics.</p>
<p>To do this effectively, we need to collect certain Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>The Personal Information We Collect From You</strong><br> All Personal Information we collect from you requires your consent, for example, opening an account, purchase and delivery of products, special offers, etc.&nbsp; We may request your consent from time to time to take part in improved product performance or for marketing purposes that we think will be useful to you.&nbsp; However, unless you are informed otherwise, the Personal Information we hold is for establishing and managing our business and customer relationship with you.&nbsp; Sensitive information is subject to greater restrictions and governed by law.</p>
<p>By communicating with Bohme, including by email and by completing online forms, you are giving your consent to the collection of what Personal Information you provide.</p>
<p>You have the right to anonymity and do not have to supply us with information.&nbsp; However, if you choose not to provide the information and we need to fulfill your request for a specific product, we may be unable to provide you with that requested product.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping a Record of Personal Information</strong><br> Depending on the product you have acquired, it may be necessary to keep a record of the transaction for business purposes or to enable us to respond to your concerns.</p>
<p>We may hold Personal Information for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal accounting and administration;</li>
<li>To supply you with information about your account including regular statements;</li>
<li>To respond to inquiries;</li>
<li>Enhancing customer service, product options and to improve product performance;</li>
<li>Promotions, competition entry forms, redemption vouchers, and special offers where you voluntarily supplied your personal details;</li>
<li>To administer sales records;</li>
<li>To provide information about us, our products, services and special offers; and</li>
<li>To analyze our website usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Occasionally we require organizations outside Bohme to provide a service for purposes, which are necessary for us to conduct our business, functions and activities (for example advertising names of competition winners and delivering products).&nbsp; We take all steps to ensure these organizations both inside and outside of the United States deal with Personal Information according to this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Our Disclosure of Your Information/Security</strong><br> Although Bohme uses industry standard practices to protect your Personal Information, due to technical limitations, WE DO NOT REPRESENT, WARRANT AND/OR GUARANTEE THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WILL REMAIN SECURE.&nbsp; Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information or private communications will always remain private.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, as a matter of policy, we NEVER sell or rent any Personal Information about you to any third party.</p>
<p>The following describes some of the ways that your Personal Information may be disclosed and you expressly agree that your Personal Information may be disclosed by Bohme in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advertisers</strong>.&nbsp; We may internally gather data across all of our Website's visitors and keep a record of your usage habits.&nbsp; As a result, we may disclose some limited, non specific Personal Information to third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.&nbsp; However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally.&nbsp; Certain information, such as your name, email address, address and telephone number are NEVER disclosed to advertisers.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal Requests</strong>.&nbsp; Bohme may lawfully disclose your Personal Information for law enforcement or regulatory purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How We Manage Your Personal Information</strong><br> You may have contact with us personally, by telephone, mail, over the Internet or other electronic medium.&nbsp; We take all reasonable steps to keep your Personal Information secure in a combination of secure computer storage, hard copy files and other records.&nbsp; We take steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.&nbsp; You have the right to access the Personal Information you have provided to us.&nbsp; If you require details of your Personal Information held by us, we will need to verify your identity before meeting your request, which we will process in a reasonable time.&nbsp; If you find that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or out of date then we will promptly correct it upon receipt of the changes from you.</p>
