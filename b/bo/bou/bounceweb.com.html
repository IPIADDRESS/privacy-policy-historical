    <td colspan="2">Bounceweb.com is committed to serving its customers <br>
      One of the ways in which Bounceweb.com assures its customers with quality service is through safeguarding the privacy of each individual that visits our website or becomes one of our customers. This policy sets for the manner in which Bounceweb.com gathers, processes, stores and organizes the information provided by our users as they visit our website. Being in an evolving technological environment, we must all understand that with technology there is change and as such Bounceweb.com will use its best efforts to afford its customers and users the newest developments in privacy protection. Like all of our standards, this policy too may change from time to time so we ask that you review these policies each time you visit our website.
        <p>No matter what type of information that is provided through the Bounceweb.com website, Bounceweb.com will protect the confidentiality of its customer's information, account information and personal information to the fullest extent possible.

            <br>
            Personally Identifiable Information<br>
            This type of information which normally consists of names, addresses, email addresses, credit card numbers, orders or request for services, will only be used in order to complete your request and provide you with the services. Unless otherwise instructed by you, Bounceweb.com may often use this information for promotional purposes, advising you of new services and products, and improving upon the services we provide to our customers. All of your credit card and purchasing information is highly secured through commercially acceptable web based security and encryption protocols. However, please note that certain personal and voluntary information which you provide on other websites, such as feedback or opinions, may be deemed non-confidential and un-protected by Bounceweb.com from disclosure.<br>
            <br>
            General Information<br>
            This refers to the generic information gathered and stored by Bounceweb.com automatically while users are browsing through our website. This information is not personal in nature.

            <br>
            Children's Policy <br>
            Children under the age of 18 are prohibited from using our services without the consent of a parent or guardian. However, it must be noted that Bounceweb.com has no way of knowing if a visitor or customer is actually under the age of 18. Therefore, it's entirely possible that we may collect, use and disclose information about users under the age of 18. We encourage parents to monitor their child's use of the Internet and advise those users under the age of 18 to obtain parental or guardian consent before disclosing any information.<br>
            <br>

In addition, Bounceweb.com will not disclose or monitor any content (personal or private electronic communications transmitted to Bounceweb.com) unless it is (i) necessary to provide service to the customer; (ii) to protect the interest of Bounceweb.com; (iii) required to cooperate with orders, warrants, subpoenas, or other legal process that Bounceweb.com determines in its sole discretion to be valid and enforceable and (iv) necessary to provide to law enforcement agency when the contents are inadvertently obtained by Bounceweb.com and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime. </p>
