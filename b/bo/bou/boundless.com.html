<h1>BOUNDLESS LEARNING, INC.</h1>
<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>Effective Date:  June 26, 2013.</p>
<p>Welcome to Boundless!</p>
<p>We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices and policies of Boundless Learning, Inc. (“Boundless”, “we”, “us” or “our”) for boundless.com and its sub-domains (the “Website”) and all related tools and services, including any downloadable applications, we make available to you from time to time (the “Services”).  The Services include a platform to help students learn by connecting them with high quality, educational content, as well as tools that enable them to collaborate with other students or educators through social media features.  This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by or in connection with the Services.  This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Boundless does not administer, or to individuals that Boundless does not employ.  We may update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new Privacy Policy to our Website.  Your access and use of the Services is subject to this Privacy Policy and to our separate Terms of Service at  <a href="http://www.boundless.com/terms">www.boundless.com/terms</a>. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning assigned to them in the Terms of Service.</p>
<h2>Notice of Information We Collect And How We Use It.</h2>
<p>Our primary purpose in collecting Personal Information (as defined below) is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience using our Services.  This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our Services to make your experience safer and easier.  "Personal Information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, or e-mail address, etc.) or other information about that individual that is directly linked to Personal Information.  Personal Information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of our Services.  We collect and store information, including Personal Information, that you provide to us when registering or when using the Services.  Some such information is required in order for you to register as a user of our Services.  You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but by doing so, you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features and functionality.  We use Personal Information to deliver the Services to you, to improve the delivery of our Services, including advertising, and to develop analytics and aggregated data that allow us and our partners to improve our Services and correspond with you.</p>
<p>We also collect and store non-personally identifiable information that is automatically generated when you use the Services.  We use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community.  By using our Services, you indicate your consent for Boundless and our affiliates to send cookies to your computer in order to uniquely identify your browser and improve the quality of our services; you may turn off cookies in your browser though, in doing so, some or all of our Services may not work.    A “cookie” is a piece of alphanumeric data stored on a visitor’s hard drive that enables us to improve your access to our Website and identify repeat visitors to our Services.  We use the non-personally identifiable information, such as your browser version, IP address, referring domains, pages visited, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, the nature of your use of the Website and cookie information, to improve our Website delivery, including advertising, and to develop analytics and aggregated data that allow us and our partners to utilize our Service and reach out to you via our Services or otherwise.  If you wish to restrict or block the cookies which are set by Boundless, or by any other website, you can do this through your browser settings. The Help function within your browser should tell you how to do so.  For information on how to delete cookies on the browser of your mobile phone as applicable you will need to refer to your handset manual.</p>
<p>In general, our collection and use of information is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boundless collects Personal Information you knowingly choose to submit to us during registration, such as your name, and email address,  which we use for the following general purposes: identification and authentication of a user, improvement to the Services, contact, research, and reporting of aggregated, anonymous data.</li>
<li>Boundless automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookies, and the pages you request.  IP addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. Your IP address is stored by Boundless when you register with Boundless. IP addresses may be used for various research purposes, and/or delivering unique functionality to our service.</li>
<li>Boundless may make discussion boards, forums and chat rooms (Public Areas) available to you on our Services.  You participate in these Public Areas with the acknowledgement that any information you share will be available to other users, including any Personal Information that you share in Public Areas, subject to the level of Public Areas which you indicate when you provide the applicable Personal Information, if any such level restriction are then offered by Boundless.  We may allow users to post content on the Services.  If we make such a feature available, you post content at your own risk.  We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you choose to share your information.  Even after removal, copies of such content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your content.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Log Files</h2>
<p>Like many websites, we may automatically gather certain information about our Website traffic and store it in log files.  This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Website, to track users’ movements around the Website and to gather demographic information about our user base.</p>
<p>We may link this automatically collected data to Personal Information.  IP addresses may be tied to Personal Information to troubleshoot access issues and ban users by IP from certain communities upon appropriate request.</p>
<p>We may use a third-party tracking service that uses log files and cookies, see “Notice of Information We Collect and How We Collect It” above, to track non- Personal Information about visitors to the Website in the aggregate.  This service captures usage and volume statistics as well as geographical location data to compile usage reports and maps for optimization and troubleshooting purposes.</p>
<h2>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h2>
<p>We employ, and our third party advertising partners may employ, a software technology called clear gifs, also referred to as web beacons or web bugs, that help manage content on the Site by tracking what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”</p>
<h2>Information We Collect To Respond To Your Choices and Requests</h2>
<div class="indented">

<p>In order to use many of our Services, you must first complete the registration form and provide an email address and password (“Login Credentials”). During registration, you are required to complete the registration form and create a user name and password and are required to give truthful contact information (such as name and email address) in accordance with our Terms of Service.   We use this information to contact you about the Services in which you have expressed interest.</p>
<p>Boundless may enable you to connect to your Boundless account with your Facebook account or other third-party social networking site account information (“Third Party Social Networking Account”).  By connecting to our Services with a Third Party Social Networking Account, you authorize Boundless and the third party social network service provider to share certain information about you with each other. We may receive and store information about you, but not limited to, your user ID associated with your Third Party Social Networking Account, and other information that you have permitted the third-party social network service provider to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that third party service.  Your use of any third-party social network service provider is subject to its terms of service and privacy policy. You should always review, and if necessary adjust, your privacy settings on social network service providers and other third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Service.</p>
<p>We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our Services.  For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.</p>
<h3>Profiles</h3>
<p>Upon registering on our Website, a user profile may automatically be created for you.  Your profile name will be your first name and last initial unless otherwise set forth on the Website from time to time. You may select a profile photo to display with your profile information. Any information you choose to display on your profile may be viewed by other users when you post in Public Areas.</p>
<h3>Subscriptions; Orders</h3>
<p>If you purchase or subscribe to a fee-based Service or other products or services from us, we request certain Personal Information from you on our transaction form.  We may require you to provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as a credit card number, expiration date, account number if paying through a third party payment processing service).  We may use an outside credit card processing company to bill or process payments for goods or services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use Personal Information for any other purposes.</p>
<p>We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.</p>
<h3>Surveys or Contests</h3>
<p>We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our Services.  If you participate, we will request certain Personal Information from you.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and mailing address) and demographic information.</p>
<p>We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic, or to personalize our Services (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys).</p>
<p>We may cooperate with third parties to offer you surveys, contests, products and services through our Services.  When you participate in such surveys or contests, or purchase related products and services, you authorize us to share information about you, including Personal Information, with such third parties.  If you have any questions or concerns regarding how such third parties use your information, please consult the applicable third party’s privacy policy.  You agree that we will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage incurred in connection with our cooperation with such third parties, their activities on our Services, and the sharing of your information with such third parties.</p>
<h3>Tell-A-Friend</h3>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service (if available) to tell a friend about our Services, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit our Website. Boundless uses this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.  Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@boundless.com">support@boundless.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<h3>Posting in Public Areas</h3>
<p>If you choose to post messages in our Public Areas or leave feedback for other users, we will collect the information you post through our Services. When you submit a message through the Services, certain information about your profile may also be associated with such message.  We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law.  We reserve the right to terminate the accounts of visitors who use these Services in a manner inconsistent with the Terms of Service.</p>
<p>When we use the phrase "public information", we mean the information you choose to disclose to other users of the Website, as well as information that is publicly available.  By posting information in a Public Area, you are choosing to make your information public.  However, some Public Areas may be restricted to a particular groups of users based on categories such as users’ class, school, or other custom created group (each a “Restricted Public Area”) to the extent indicated on the Website from time to time, such that information posted or shared in Restricted Public Areas will only be viewable by other users who have access to such Restricted Public Area.  Please note that, once you share information in a Public Area, or even a Restricted Public Area, other users may copy and share such information, through the Website or otherwise, with third parties or use such information for other purposes.</p>
<p>Choosing to make your information public also means that this information:</p>
<ul>
<li>can be associated with you (i.e., your name, profile picture, profile, username, etc.)</li>
<li>when others share information about you, they can also choose to make it public.</li>
</ul>
<p>The types of information listed below are by default publicly available, and are treated just like information you decided to make public.</p>
<ul>
<li>Name: This helps other users find you. By making your profile private, users may still search for and find your limited profile, such as your name as may be set forth by Boundless on the Website from time to time.</li>
<li>Avatar or Profile Picture: Boundless may allow you to have an avatar or profile picture to help other users recognize you. If you are uncomfortable making your avatar or profile picture public, you can always delete it by hovering over profile picture and clicking "Change Picture."  A default profile picture may be assigned to your profile until you select one.</li>
<li>Custom Created Groups:  Boundless may allow you to share information with a limited group of other users as set forth on the Website from time to time.  Limited groups may include groupings based on a class or school or other group set forth on the Website from time to time (“User Groups”).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Social Notebook; User Notes</h3>
<p>Part of the Services include a Social Notebook feature that permits users to take notes online and highlight text (collectively “User Notes”) while reading online and share such User Notes with other users.  By submitting such User Notes on our Website you deem such User Notes as Contributions for public display on our Services, unless, you opt-out through your account settings by making your User Notes “private.” If made public, your User Notes may be displayed in our Public Areas.  Otherwise, if your settings are private for User Notes, Boundless may use your User Notes on an aggregate basis by removing any Personal Information.  You may not be able to view other users User Notes on the Website, if you make your own User Notes private.</p>
<p>If you choose to create User Notes or post Contributions in our Public Areas or leave feedback for other users, we will collect the information you post through our Services. When you submit a message through the Services, certain information about your profile may also be associated with such message.  We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law.</p>
<h3>Dashboard Metrics; Social Activity Feed</h3>
<p>Based on your privacy settings, we may make certain information about your use of the Services available for others to view on the Website from time to time, including, without limitation, which texts you have viewed or what Contributions you have made as well as your other uses of our Services as we describe on the Website from time to time.  You may opt-out of this feature through your account settings by making your use of the Services “private.”</p>
<h3>Communications with Class Instructor</h3>
<p>The Services may permit Instructors to interact with users of a particular Class and may use Boundless as a forum to assist students with their studies outside of the classroom.  An Instructor may view Restricted Public Areas for a particular class, as well as any other information that a user makes available to that Instructor.  Boundless may provide an option on the Website for a user to select for certain information to share only with an Instructor of a Class.  Boundless may add a feature to the Services for Instructors to assign study questions to certain users of a Class.  Instructors may be permitted to receive a summary of certain metrics as described on the Website from time to time regarding how certain users within a Class are using the Services.
