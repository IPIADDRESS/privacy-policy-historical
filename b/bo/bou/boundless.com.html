<h1>BOUNDLESS LEARNING, INC.</h1>
<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>Effective Date: March 11, 2016.</p>
<p>Welcome to Boundless!</p>
<p>We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly.

(“Boundless”, “we”, “us” or “our”) for use of boundless.com and its sub-domains (the “Website”) and for access to and use of any downloadable Boundless software or content through your use of an application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of e-learning courses or training programs (an “LMS”) operated by your college, university or other educational institution (a “School”) and all related tools and services we make available to you from time to time (the “Services”).  This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by us in connection with the Services.  Your access and use of the Services is subject to this Privacy Policy and to our separate Terms of Service.  Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings assigned to them in the Terms of Service.</p>
<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of entities that Boundless does not administer or control, including but not limited to your School, or to individuals that Boundless does not employ. The use of any information provided by you to your School through the LMS is governed by the privacy policy applicable to such School and your use of the LMS.  Please check with your School prior to your use of the Services through the LMS to be sure you understand their privacy policies.</p>
<p>Our Services are not directed to people who are under 13 years of age. If you become aware that your child or a minor for whom you are the guardian has provided us with information without your consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@boundless.com?subject=General Query">support@boundless.com</a>. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with information, we take steps to remove that information and terminate the applicable account.</p>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new Privacy Policy to our Website for users of the Public Areas of our Website and by requiring your acceptance of the revised Terms of Service when you access private portions of the Website or when you use the LMS to access the Services and shall be effective from the time of your next use of the Services after such posting or acceptance.</p>

<div class="indented">
<h3>(i) PERSONAL INFORMATION.</h3>
<p>We collect and store information that you knowingly provide to us when you register or use the Services that specifically identifies you or can be used to identify you, such as your name, your mailing address and your e-mail address (“Personal Information”) and other information about you that is directly linked to your Personal Information.</p>

IP addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. We also  employ, and our third party advertising partners may employ, a software technology called clear gifs, also referred to as web beacons or web bugs, that help manage content on the Site by tracking what content is effective.
