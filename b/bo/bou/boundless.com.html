<h1>BOUNDLESS LEARNING, INC.</h1>

<p>Effective Date: March 11, 2016.</p>

<p>We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly.

(“Boundless”, “we”, “us” or “our”) for use of boundless.com and its sub-domains (the “Website”) and for access to and use of any downloadable Boundless software or content through your use of an application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of e-learning courses or training programs (an “LMS”) operated by your college, university or other educational institution (a “School”) and all related tools and services we make available to you from time to time (the “Services”).  This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by us in connection with the Services.  Your access and use of the Services is subject to this Privacy Policy and to our separate Terms of Service.  Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings assigned to them in the Terms of Service.</p>
<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of entities that Boundless does not administer or control, including but not limited to your School, or to individuals that Boundless does not employ. The use of any information provided by you to your School through the LMS is governed by the privacy policy applicable to such School and your use of the LMS.  Please check with your School prior to your use of the Services through the LMS to be sure you understand their privacy policies.</p>

If you become aware that your child or a minor for whom you are the guardian has provided us with information without your consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@boundless.com?subject=General Query">support@boundless.com</a>. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with information, we take steps to remove that information and terminate the applicable account.</p>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new Privacy Policy to our Website for users of the Public Areas of our Website and by requiring your acceptance of the revised Terms of Service when you access private portions of the Website or when you use the LMS to access the Services and shall be effective from the time of your next use of the Services after such posting or acceptance.</p>
