<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Boundless Learning, Inc. knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we
appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy
for boundless.com and its sub-domains (the “Site”).
</p>
<p>
If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, you should contact Boundless Learning by
emailing
<a href="mailto:privacy@boundless.com">privacy@boundless.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
This privacy policy covers only information that is collected through the Site and does not cover
information that may be collected through software downloaded from the Site.
</p>
<h2>Notice of Information We Collect And How We Use It</h2>
<p>
Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient,
and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your
needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal
information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.
</p>
<p>
In general, you can browse basic information on the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any
personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are no longer
anonymous to us.
</p>
<h2>Information We Collect About Anonymous Visitors</h2>
<p>
We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Site. We use this information
to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect
and serve you and our community.
</p>
<div>
<h3>Log Files</h3>
<p>
Like many Web sites, we automatically gather certain information about our Site traffic and store it in
log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service
provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this
information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track
users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base.
</p>
<p>
We link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to
personally identifiable information to improve the functionality of the service.
</p>
<p>
We use a third-party tracking service that uses log files and cookies to track non-personally identifiable
information about visitors to the Site in the aggregate. This service captures usage and volume statistics
to measure usage and conversion data.
</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use
cookies on this site. As noted above, we link the information we store in cookies to any personally
identifiable information you submit while on our site. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by
the Site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
</p>
<p>We use both session ID and persistent cookies.</p>
<p>
A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. We use session cookies to make it easier for you
to navigate our site.
</p>
<p>
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent
cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.
</p>
<p>
We set a persistent cookie to store your password, so you don’t have to enter it more than once.
Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience
on our site.
</p>
<p>
Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our Site. We have no access to or control
over these cookies. See “Third Party Advertisers.”
</p>
<h3>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h3>
<p>
We employ and our third party advertising partner may employ a software technology called clear gifs, also
referred to as web beacons or web bugs, that help manage content on the Site by tracking what content is
effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are
used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s
computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period
at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally
identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened. This allows
us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”
</p>
</div>
<h2>Information We Collect To Respond To Your Choices and Requests</h2>
<div>
<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>
In order to use some features of this Site, you must first complete the registration form and create a
user name and password. During registration you are required to give truthful contact information (such as
name and email address) in accordance with our terms of use root-domain/terms. We use this information to
contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.
</p>
<p>
You have the option to provide demographic information (such as income level and preferred language of
communication) to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more
personalized experience on our site.
</p>
<h3>Orders</h3>
<p>
If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from
you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address)
and financial information (such as a credit card number and expiration date).
</p>
<p>
We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an
order, we will use this information to contact you.
</p>
<h3>Surveys or Contests</h3>
<p>
We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate,
we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. The requested information typically
includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information.
</p>
<p>
We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic, or to
personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys) and to send participants
an email newsletter.
</p>
<p>
We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company is not
prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
</p>
<h3>Tell-A-Friend</h3>
<p>
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your
friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or
her to visit the site. Boundless Learning stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this
one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.
</p>
<p>Your friend may contact us at root-domain to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<h3>Chat Rooms</h3>
<p>
If you choose to post messages in our chat rooms or other public message areas or leave feedback for other
users, we will collect the information you post. We retain this information as necessary to resolve
disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law.
</p>
<p>
If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send
us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a
file specific to you. We reserve the right to terminate the accounts of visitors who use these services in
a manner in consistent with the terms of use at root-domain/terms.
</p>
<h3>Communication from Us or the Site</h3>
<div>
<h4>Special Offers and Updates</h4>
<p>
We may occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, and promotions. You can
sign up for these emails from us on our registration page.
</p>
<p>
Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications.
Please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section.
</p>
<h4>Newsletters</h4>
<p>
If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the
newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the
“Choice and Opt-out” section.
</p>
<h4>Service-Related Announcements</h4>
<p>
We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.
For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.
</p>
<p>
Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not
wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.
</p>
</div>
<h3>Customer Service</h3>
<p>
Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to
verify your username and password. We will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide
the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone,
in accordance with your wishes.
</p>
<h3>Profile</h3>
<p>
We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third party sources to
create a “profile” of your preferences. We tie your personally identifiable information, and your
purchasing history, to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing
offers and to improve the content of the site for you.
</p>
<p>We share your profile to third parties in aggregate form only.</p>
<h3>Enhancement of Profile Information</h3>
<p>
We purchase marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database, to better target
our advertising and to provide pertinent offers in which we think you would be interested. To enrich our
Profiles of individual customers, we tie this information to the personally identifiable information they
have provided to us.
</p>
</div>
<h2>Conditions Under Which We Share Information</h2>
<div>
<h3>Aggregate Information (Non-Personally Identifiable)</h3>
<p>
We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers.
This information does not identify individual users.
</p>
<p>We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.</p>
<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>Except as discussed below, we do not share Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties.</p>
</div>
<h2>Agents</h2>
<p>
We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for
goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information
for any other purposes.
</p>
<h2>Third Party Advertisers</h2>
<p>
The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by our advertising partner. We share Web site
usage information about users with our advertising partner for the purpose of targeting our Internet
banner advertisements on this site.
</p>
<p>
Our advertising partner may use cookies and clear GIFs on the Site, which allow it to recognize a user’s
cookie when a user visits the Site. The information that our advertising partner collects and shares
through this technology is not personally identifiable.
</p>
<p>
For more information about our third-party advertiser, or to learn more about the choices available to you
regarding this anonymous information, please contact
<a href="mailto:privacy@boundless.com?subject=Third-Party advetiser">privacy@boundless.com</a>.
</p>
<h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we
believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights; to comply with a judicial proceeding, court
order, or legal process served on us or the Site; or in connection with an actual or proposed corporate
transaction or insolvency proceeding involving all or part of the business or asset to which the
information pertains.
</p>
<h2>Choice/Opt-out</h2>
<p>
We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for
certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do
not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our
order form.
</p>
<p>
If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of
receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing
us at
<a href="mailto:support@boundless.com">support@boundless.com</a>.
</p>
<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>
The Site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by boundless Learning. Please be
aware that we are not responsible for the privacy policies of such other sites.
</p>
<p>
We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Site and to read the privacy policies of each and every
Web site that collects personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>This privacy policy applies only to information collected by the Site.</p>
<h2>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
<p>
If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may
correct, update, delete or deactivate it emailing our Customer Support at
<a href="mailto:support@boundless.com">support@boundless.com</a>,
or by
contacting us by postal mail at the contact information listed below.
</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such
as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that
information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
</p>
<p>
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both
during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable
means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at
<a href="mailto:support@boundless.com">support@boundless.com</a>.
</p>
<h2>Changes in this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post changes to this privacy policy and other places we
deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
</p>
<p>
We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make
changes that materially affect our uses or disclosures of personally identifiable information that we have
previously collected, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
