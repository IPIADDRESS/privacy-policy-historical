      <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

      <p>Boundless Learning, Inc. knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we
      appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy
      for boundless.com and its sub-domains (the “Site”).</p>

      <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, you should contact Boundless Learning by
      emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@boundless.com">privacy@boundless.com</a>.</p>

      <p>This privacy policy covers only information that is collected through the Site and does not cover
      information that may be collected through software downloaded from the Site.</p>

      <h2 id="Notice_of_Information_We_Collect_And_How_We_Use_It">Notice of Information We Collect And How We Use It</h2>

      <p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient,
      and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your
      needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal
      information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.</p>

      <p>In general, you can browse basic information on the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any
      personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are no longer
      anonymous to us.</p>

      <h2 id="Information_We_Collect_About_Anonymous_Visitors">Information We Collect About Anonymous Visitors</h2>

      <p>We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Site. We use this information
      to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect
      and serve you and our community.</p>

      <h3 id="Log_Files">Log Files</h3>

      <p>Like many Web sites, we automatically gather certain information about our Site traffic and store it in
      log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service
      provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this
      information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track
      users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base.</p>

      <p>We link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to
      personally identifiable information to improve the functionality of the service.</p>

      <p>We use a third-party tracking service that uses log files and cookies to track non-personally identifiable
      information about visitors to the Site in the aggregate. This service captures usage and volume statistics
      to measure usage and conversion data.</p>

      <h3 id="Cookies">Cookies</h3>

      <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use
      cookies on this site. As noted above, we link the information we store in cookies to any personally
      identifiable information you submit while on our site. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by
      the Site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

      <p>We use both session ID and persistent cookies.</p>

      <p>A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. We use session cookies to make it easier for you
      to navigate our site.</p>

      <p>A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent
      cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.</p>

      <p>We set a persistent cookie to store your password, so you don’t have to enter it more than once.
      Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience
      on our site.</p>

      <p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our Site. We have no access to or control
      over these cookies. See “Third Party Advertisers.”</p>

      <h3 id="Clear_Gifs__Web_Beacons_Web_Bugs_">Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h3>

      <p>We employ and our third party advertising partner may employ a software technology called clear gifs, also
      referred to as web beacons or web bugs, that help manage content on the Site by tracking what content is
      effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are
      used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s
      computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period
      at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally
      identifiable information.</p>

      <p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened. This allows
      us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
      If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”</p>

      you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address)
      and financial information (such as a credit card number and expiration date).</p>

      <p>We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic, or to
      personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys) and to send participants
      an email newsletter.</p>

      <p>We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company is not

      one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.</p>

      <p>Your friend may contact us at root-domain to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

      disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law.</p>

      <p>If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send
      us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a

      <h2 id="Legal_Disclaimer">Legal Disclaimer</h2>

      <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we
      believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights; to comply with a judicial proceeding, court
      order, or legal process served on us or the Site; or in connection with an actual or proposed corporate
      transaction or insolvency proceeding involving all or part of the business or asset to which the
      information pertains.</p>

      <h2 id="Choice_Opt-out">Choice/Opt-out</h2>

      <p>We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for
      certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do
      not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our
      order form.</p>

      <p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of
      receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing
      us at <a href="mailto:support@boundless.com">support@boundless.com</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="Links_to_Other_Sites">Links to Other Sites</h2>

      <p>The Site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by boundless Learning. Please be
      aware that we are not responsible for the privacy policies of such other sites.</p>

      <p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Site and to read the privacy policies of each and every
      Web site that collects personally identifiable information.</p>

      <p>This privacy policy applies only to information collected by the Site.</p>

      <h2 id="Access_to_Personally_Identifiable_Information">Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h2>

      <p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may
      correct, update, delete or deactivate it emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:support@boundless.com">support@boundless.com</a>, or by

      <h2 id="Security">Security</h2>

      <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such
      as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that
      information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

      <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both
      during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
      electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable
      means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

      <p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at <a href="mailto:support@boundless.com">support@boundless.com</a>.</p>

      deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
      circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>

      <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make
      changes that materially affect our uses or disclosures of personally identifiable information that we have
      previously collected, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>
