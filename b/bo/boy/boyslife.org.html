<p><i>Boys' Life</i> magazine is committed to respecting and protecting the 
personal privacy of its members and those who visit its Web site.  It is 
our policy to acquire personal information from users only by overt and 
voluntary means, only when it is in the interest of the user to provide it, 
and to utilize this information only for the purpose it was provided.</p>
<p>The information that follows explains the kinds of information this
Web site collects, how it is used, the conditions under which it is made 
available to third parties, how information is maintained, and our compliance 
with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.</p>

<h2>What information does this site collect?</h2>
<p>This site collects anonymous data that is not indicative of and cannot be 
traced to an individual without the cooperation of their Internet Service 
Provider.  This data includes information about the user's remote IP address, 
referral data (which page "linked" to the present request), and the browser 
software's user-agent string.   This information is accepted passively from 
the HTTP headers that are sent from the user when requesting any file from 
the server.  Other anonymous data entered by the user may be collected in a 
common repository, including terms entered into the search engine, ZIP codes 
entered into the council locator, etc.</p>  
<p>Personally identifiable data is collected only by means of form interfaces 
on the site, into which the user must voluntarily enter the information 
requested.  This information is requested only when it is necessary to 
accomplish the overt purpose indicated by the interface containing the form 
that requests it.  Such form interfaces require only the information reasonably 
necessary to accomplish the overt purpose indicated on the interface.</p>
<p>No attempt is made to covertly or "quietly" collect personally identifiable 
information, nor are cookies or any other tracking technology used for the 
purpose of coordinating information that a user may opt to enter in various 
interfaces on the site.</p>

<h2>What organization is collecting the information?</h2>
<p>Information entered by site visitors is retrieved directly by the Boy Scouts 
of America, National Council: 1325 West Walnut Hill Lane, Post Office Box 152079, 
Irving, TX, 75015-2079 - telephone (972) 580-2000.</p>

<h2>How does the BSA use the information it collects?</h2>
<p>The anonymous information collected is used to monitor the usage of this Web 
site and the interests of those who use it.  Data such as the volume of traffic 
to the server, the number of visitors a certain section of the site receives 
each month, or the most popular search terms are analyzed to derive general 
statistics about the site's reach and the audience's usage patterns.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information is used only for the express purpose for 
which it was submitted.  For example, if a user enters their contact information 
in the "change of address" form, the information will be used only to change their 
address or to correspond with them regarding the change of address.</p>

<h2>With whom does the BSA share the information that is collected?</h2>
<p>The BSA does not share personally identifiable information about web site 
visitors with anyone.</p>
<p>Reports, statistics, and other analyses of aggregate anonymous information 
may be shared within the organization or provided to third parties at the sole 
discretion of the Boy Scouts of America.  This information does not include any
personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Exception: the Boy Scouts of America reserves the right to use all information 
at its disposal and to share this information with ISPs and other third parties 
as necessary to investigate any incident of misuse or abuse of its site, server, 
or information systems.</p> 

<h2>How does the BSA maintain the information it collects?</h2>
<p>In most cases, personally identifiable information is not maintained.  Once it 
has been used for its intended purpose, it is deleted.  Because of the brevity of 
this interval, no mechanism is provided to enable users to alter or delete 
information they have submitted.</p>

<h2>How does this Web site with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998?</h2>
<p>Any interface that requests personally identifiable information is accompanied 
by a notice that submissions cannot be accepted from users under 13 years of age,
and an address is provided so that those users may correspond with us via postal 
mail.  Additionally, all forms requesting personally identifiable information also
require the user to enter their age or date of birth. No information will be stored 
or transmitted unless the response indicates that the user is 13 years of age or 
older.</p>
<p>Providing personal information via the Internet is <i>never</i> a prerequisite 
for accessing any of the content or resources on this Web site.  Specifically, 
refusal to provide personal information via a Web interface will never result in
a user being denied access to any on-line content or resource he would be able to access were the 
information submitted.</p>

<h2>Policy Modifications and Deviations</h2>
<p>We may modify this privacy policy and will post those changes here.  If the 
privacy policy changes in the future, we will not any personal information you 
have submitted to us under the current Privacy Policy in a manner that is 
materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent.</p>
<p>It may be necessary to deviate from this general policy in unique instances and 
for specific purposes.  In such instances, a link will be provided to a description 
of the deviation.  This link will be placed where it can be reasonably expected to 
be noticed prior to submitting any information for which this privacy policy is 
modified or exempted in any way.</p>
