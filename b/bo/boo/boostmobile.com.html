We collect a variety of personal information about our customers.</p> <p>There are several ways in which <em>Boost Mobile</em> collects personal and other information about you. You should refer to the rest of this Policy to see how we use, disclose, and protect that information.</p> <p><u>Information You Provide:</u> We collect information you give us when you purchase a <em>Boost Mobile</em> phone or device, or when you use <em>Boost Mobile</em> services. For example, you may provide us a billing address and credit information, including your social security number, when signing up for service or perhaps purchasing a product through our online store B-Shop.</p> <p>The information you provide us during a visit to boostmobile.com helps us to improve the quality and utility of our site. It generally falls into two categories: (1) information you supply when you purchase phones, accessories or other goods, activate <em>Boost Mobile</em> service, enter contests or sweepstakes, register a <em>Boost Mobile</em> account, or sign up for a product or service jointly offered by <em>Boost Mobile</em> and another company, and (2) tracking information gathered as you navigate through the boostmobile.com site. Third-party providers, whose sites are featured on and accessed via our site, may gather information as well.</p> <p>When you purchase <em>Boost Mobile</em> phones, accessories, or services, we request the following types of information on our order form:</p> <ul> <li>Name</li> <li>Shipping and/or billing address</li> <li>Credit card number or account number </li> <li>Phone number</li> <li>Mobile Phone number</li> <li>Email address</li> <li>Date of birth</li> <li>Account passcode</li> </ul> <p>We need this information to process your order. If we have trouble processing your order, the contact information you provide is used to get in touch with you. We also use this contact information to provide you with updates regarding your current phone or service and to provide you with information about <em>Boost Mobile</em> promotions and special offers.</p> <p><u>Automatically Collected Information:</u> We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, when you visit a <em>Boost Mobile</em> site, our systems automatically collect your IP address and the type of browser you use. Similarly, all wireless communications systems know when your phone is turned on and approximately where the device is physically located; that's how calls or messages are delivered to you in real time.</p> <p><u>Information from Other Sources:</u> We may obtain information about you from outside sources and add it to or combine it with your account information. For example, we often receive information from the retailer from whom you purchased your <em>Boost Mobile</em> phone or device prior to initiating service with us. We also may use commercially available demographic and marketing information from third parties to help us better serve you or inform you about products or services that we think will be of interest to you.<a href="#"><strong> -Back to Top</strong></a></p> <h3>Children‚Äôs Privacy<a id="2" name="2"></a></h3> <p><em>Boost Mobile</em> does not collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Of course, it is possible that a child under 13 might attempt to submit his or her personal information on this site. For example, a child under 13 may try to register a <em>Boost Mobile</em> account or enter a contest. <em>Boost Mobile</em> has installed a blocking filter on this Site to prevent children under 13 from submitting personal information on the registration/login page and to prevent children under 18 from entering contests or sweepstakes.</p> <p>You should also be aware that wireless devices and services purchased for family use may be used by children under 13 without the knowledge of <em>Boost Mobile</em>. If that happens, any information collected from the usage will appear to be the personal information of the actual adult subscriber and treated as such under this Policy.</p> <p>If you have any questions about <em>Boost Mobile‚Äôs</em> procedures to prevent the collection of information from children under 13, please contact us at <em>Boost</em> Customer Care at 1-866-402-7366. <a href="#"><strong>-Back to Top</strong></a> </p> <h3><em>Boost Mobile‚Äôs</em> Use of Personal Information<a id="3" name="3"></a></h3> <p>We use personal information for billing purposes, to provide services or complete transactions you have requested, to anticipate and resolve problems with your services, and tell you about products or services from <em>Boost Mobile</em> or others that better meet your needs.

In those cases, you will be providing information to those providers, and information those third parties receive about you will be governed by their privacy policies, not this Policy. For example, if you purchase something using our Wireless Web service, you will be disclosing personal information directly to the company facilitating the transaction. If you are roaming on the network of another carrier, information about your usage and the numbers you dial will be available to the carrier providing the service. And if you bought your wireless device from a third party retailer, both the retailer and <em>Boost Mobile</em> will have your personal information as a result of the transaction.</p> <p><em>Boost Mobile</em> may offer the opportunity to participate in contests, giveaways, or other similar promotions we sponsor. Except as explained otherwise in the rules for a particular contest, giveaway, or promotion, any personal information you provide will be used in accordance with this Policy.</p> <p>Under federal law, you have a right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of information about your telephone usage, the services you buy from us, who you call, and the location of your device on our network when you make a voice call. This information is sometimes referred to as "Customer Proprietary Network Information," or "CPNI." We share CPNI and other personal information about you with <em>Boost Mobile</em> Affiliates, including Nextel Communications. Before sharing CPNI with, we will first notify you of your rights under the law, describe how we intend to use the CPNI, and give you an opportunity to opt out of such usage (or, when required by law, to opt in).</p> <p>As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets.

This anonymous identifier is NOT your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, or any other information that personally identifies you. The use of such anonymous identifiers (such as cookies, Web beacons or "tagging") is subject to the advertising company's privacy policy, not this <em>Boost Mobile</em> Privacy Policy. <a href="#"><strong>-Back to Top</strong></a> </p> <h3>Security<a id="10" name="10"></a></h3> <p>The information we collect from our customers and visitors to our site is stored in databases we control. Physical access to the servers on which we store visitor information is restricted. We use your credit card information only to bill you for the products and services you order from us.

I've never been more pleased with my wireless service than I am right now. Two months ago I left a contract plan with another carrier after nearly 10 years and I'm proud to tell people I'm now a Boost Mobile customer. Your company offers a necessary service at a great price. I also feel appreciated which is something that completely took me by surprise. Thank you. "<br> <span>- Dana L. (Morgantown, KY)</span></li> <li>"I really like the $50 Unlimited plan with Shrinkage. In my opinion, it says Boost appreciates their customers by giving discounts on monthly unlimited after paying your bill on time. I love being able to surf the internet from my phone and I can do it cheaper than any internet service can offer. I have been with alot of different carriers and Boost is by far the best. I recommend anyone to try Boost Mobile. I promise you will stay."<br> <span>- Danyelle H. (Muldrow, OK)</span></li> <li>"I would absolutely recommend Boost Mobile to my friends! What attracted me to Boost was the International Plan which was highly recommended to me by two people. I will certainly return the favor and recommend it to anyone else who can benefit from this awesome product and service. "<br> <span>- Daniel C.
