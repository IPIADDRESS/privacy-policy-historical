            through your conduct on the Site and /or through your use of the Service.
        </p>

        <p> In this Privacy Policy, we use the following terms to describe different types of visitors to the Site. Our
            customers are called “Businesses” and our Businesses’ customers are called “Customers”. We use the word

            These people are collectively described in this Privacy Policy as “Users” of the Site.
        </p>

        <p> This Privacy Policy is in addition to any other terms of service applicable to the Site. We do not make any
            representations about third party web sites that may be linked to the Site.
        </p>

        <p> We recognise the importance of protecting the privacy of information collected about visitors to the Site,
            in particular information that is capable of identifying an individual ("personal information"). This
            Privacy Policy governs the manner in which your personal information, obtained through the Site, will be
            dealt with. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at
            any time. This Privacy Policy should be reviewed periodically so that you are updated on any changes. We
            welcome your comments and feedback.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Personal Information</h3>

        <p>
            Personal information about Users to the Site is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. For
            example, we may need to collect such information to provide you with further services or to answer or
            forward
            any requests or enquiries to third parties. It is our intention that this policy will protect your personal
            information from being dealt with in any way that is inconsistent with applicable privacy laws in Australia.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Use of Information</h3>

        <p>Personal information that Users submit to the Site is used only for the purpose for which it is submitted or
            for
            such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose, unless we disclose other uses in this
            Privacy Policy or at the time of collection.</p>

        <h3>3. Personal information that we collect about Businesses and staff</h3>

        <p>We collect personal information about Businesses and their staff in order for Businesses to take full
            advantage of the Service. This includes but is not limited to staff names, email addresses, business
            address, telephone numbers, availability. You may access this information at any time by logging in to your
            account.</p>

        <p>We may also collect credit card details and billing address in order to process payments for the use of the
            Service. These credit card details are securely transmitted to a selected third party (payment gateway) for
            the sole purpose of processing such payments. The payment gateway is responsible for securely storing such
            credit card details and for limiting their access to authorized users.</p>

        <p>We do not store credit card details in our Site or in any facility operated by us. We may, however, store
            partial credit card details (card type, expiry date, and no more than 3 digits from the card number), in
            order to let the Business identify and update the credit card details used for payment processing.</p>

        <h3>4. Personal information that we collect about Customers</h3>

        <p>We collect personal information about Customers in order for Customers to take full advantage of the service.
            This information includes but is not limited to names, email addresses, addresses, telephone numbers, dates
            of birth, and other personal information as required by the Business that the Customer intends to do
            business with. This personal information will be transferred to the intended Business and its staff.</p>

        <p>We may also collect credit card details and billing address on behalf of the Business. These credit card
            details are securely transmitted to a selected third party (payment gateway) for the sole purpose of
            processing payments on behalf of the Business. The credit card details of a Customer are never shown in full
            to a Business or its staff. The payment gateway is responsible for securely storing such credit card details
            and for limiting their access to authorized users.</p>

            purpose
            of delivering the purchased product or service requested by the customer.

        <p>We may send notification emails to the email address provided by Users regarding bookings, cancellations,
            purchases, membership subscriptions, billing or other activities that are part of the Service and that are
            related to the User.</p>

        <p>We may send periodic company news, updates, and/or related product or service information.</p>

        <p>Businesses may send marketing emails to their Customers at their discretion. If Businesses send marketing
