        <h2>1. Personal Information</h2>

        <p>
            Personal information about Users to the Site is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. For
            example, we may need to collect such information to provide you with further services or to answer or
            forward
            any requests or enquiries to third parties. It is our intention that this policy will protect your personal
            information from being dealt with in any way that is inconsistent with applicable privacy laws in Australia.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>

        <p>Personal information that Users submit to the Site is used only for the purpose for which it is submitted or
            for
            such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose, unless we disclose other uses in this
            Privacy Policy or at the time of collection.</p>

        <h2>3. Personal information that we collect about Businesses and staff</h2>

            credit card details and for limiting their access to authorized users.</p>

        <p>We do not store credit card details in our Site or in any facility operated by us. We may, however, store
            partial credit card details (card type, expiry date, and no more than 3 digits from the card number), in

            business with. This personal information will be transferred to the intended Business and its staff.</p>

        <p>We may also collect credit card details and billing address on behalf of the Business. These credit card
            details are securely transmitted to a selected third party (payment gateway) for the sole purpose of
            processing payments on behalf of the Business. The credit card details of a Customer are never shown in full
            to a Business or its staff. The payment gateway is responsible for securely storing such credit card details
            and for limiting their access to authorized users.</p>

        <p>We do not store credit card details in our Site or in any facility operated by us. We may, however, store

            order to let the Customer identify and update the credit card details used for payment processing.</p>

            purpose

        </p>

        <p>
            We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process
            and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
