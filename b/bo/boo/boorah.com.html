					<h4>BooRah - Privacy Policy</h4>
					<br style="clear:both">
					 <p>Boorah knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting Boorah's web site, submitting in
formation or using any of our products or services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <a name="privacy"></a>
    <p><strong>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</strong>
</p><p>This Privacy Policy covers Boorah's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Boorah gathers when you are accessing Boorah's web site and when you use Boorah products or services. The types of Per
sonal Information collected include your full name, address, and e-mail address. Also, this Policy covers Boorah's treatment of any Personal Information that Boorah's business partners share with Boorah.  This policy does not apply to t
he practices of companies that Boorah does not own or control, or to individuals that Boorah does not employ or manage.</p>
    <a name="information"></a>
    <p><strong>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES BOORAH COLLECT?</strong>
        </p><p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our products and services. We collect the following types of information from our customers.</p>
    
<p>
     <em> Personal Information You Provide to Us:</em></p><p>We may receive and store any information you enter on our web site or in connection with our products or services or that you provide to us in any other way. The Personal Informat
ion you provide may be used for such purposes as customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about offers and new products and services.</p>

        <p>
      <em>Personal Information Collected Automatically: </em>
        </p><p>
We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our web site or services. Boorah may choose to automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address,
 cookie information, and the page you requested.<br>
Generally, our service may automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of users of our site and services and its components. Boorah only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure,
 and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the web site or services so that we can improve those services. As part of this use of inform
ation, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site and services. 
        </p>

        <p>
      <em>E-mail Communications:</em>
</p><p>
We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Boorah if your computer supports this type of program.  We may also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary m
essages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please notify us by e-mail at mailing@Boorah.com and include sufficient information for us to identify your account.
</p>

<p>
<em>What About Cookies? </em>

y how many people. Boorah cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or to identify your name or e-mail add
ress.  Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptan
ce of each new cookie in a variety of ways.

    </p>
