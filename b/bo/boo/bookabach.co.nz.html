     <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
     <h2>Our commitment to your privacy...</h2>
     
  <p>Bookabach is strongly committed to your right to privacy and 
  to taking steps designed to secure your personal information. To earn your trust 
  and confidence in our commitment, the intent of this policy is to fully disclose 
  our privacy practices to you. <b>We will only use your personal information 
    in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</b> <b>First and foremost you need to 
    know that our policy is to NOT sell or pass on your membership details to any 
    other organization!</b></p>
  <h2>When you make a rental enquiry</h2>
  <p>When you make a rental enquiry through bookabach.co.nz for the first time you are allocated 
  a membership in our system. We request that 
  you provide the following: your <em>first name</em>, <em>last name</em>, <em>email address</em>, and <em>contact 
    phone numbers</em>. This information becomes part of your Personal Profile which 
  you can change at anytime when you re-use the system. You have the option to 
  receive our newsletter and other related communications - but can opt out of 
  receiving these communications from us. You can also request that your entire 
  Personal Profile be removed by logging in and unsubscribing.</p>
  <h2>When you list a property</h2>
  <p>When you register to list a property we 
  request that you provide the following additional information over basic membership: your <em>physical address </em>and the <em>locale </em>(town, village, beach name) your bach is located. This 
  information becomes part of your Personal and Bach Profiles which you can change 
  at anytime when you are logged in. If you are a property manager, booking agent or family member registering a property on behalf of the property owner we request that you also provide their contact details in case we need to contact them. </p>
  <h2>When you join a Bach Circle</h2>
  <p>If you are added to a Bach Circle by a bach owner or property manager
  we collect personal information 
  necessary to invite you to join this facility, i.e. your <em>first name</em>, <em>last name</em> and <em>email address</em>. When you accept this invitation and complete your registration you are asked to provide additional information including your contact <em>phone number</em>. This 
  information becomes part of your Personal Profile which you can change 
  at anytime when you are logged in.</p>
  <h2>Use of cookies</h2>
  <p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored 
  by your browser on your computerâ€™s hard drive. Cookies can be used to recognise 
  you as a member and can be used to automatically configure services. We use 
  Cookies for what is termed "session management" - after a certain 
  amount of time Bookabach will automatically log you out if you've forgotten to 
  do so.</p>
  <p>When you visit our website, we may record your "IP addresses" and 
  information on the type of operating system (e.g. Windows XP or Apple OS) and browser software 
  (e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape, Opera etc.) you are using. This 
  information is used to diagnose problems with our service and for planning capacity and compatibility. Your IP 
  address may also be used to help gather aggregated demographic information, such as which ISP you are using or what country you are connecting from.</p>
  <h2>How we use email</h2>
  <p>We use email to acknowledge "solicited transactions", e.g. confirming membership, automatically alerting you of booking requests made by Bookabach members. We also send a periodic newsletter (Bachchat). </p>
  <p>Bookabach fully complies with the requirements of the NZ <em>Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act 2007</em> with <em>Express </em>and <em>Inferred </em>consent. Bookabach includes a structured opt out facility on ALL commercial electronic messages. Additionally, our site provides you the opportunity 
  to manage your own Personal Profile, including email preferences (Personal Preferences), allowing you to opt-out at any stage from receiving such communications. </p>
  <p>If you have a property listed on Bookabach we reserve the right to contact you regarding <em>critical website updates </em> and key alerts indicating outstanding requests. </p>
  <p>Finally, your email address may also be used if it becomes necessary 
    to contact you individually for any reason. </p>
<h2>The security measures we take to protect your personal information</h2>
  <p>Bookabach uses individual member passwords as a security 
  mechanism to prevent unauthorised access to your information. You should not disclose
  this password to any third party. The information you provide is stored on our own dedicated servers. We use appropriate technologies, tools and best practice methodologies to prevent access to these machines from anyone without appropriate authority. </p>
  <h2>Security of financial transaction security</h2>
<p>For online financial transactions Bookabach uses Direct Payment Solutions Ltd (DPS). DPS is used by a large number of NZ-based online businesses and corporates including Trade Me, Air New Zealand and Ticketek. DPS provide the Secure Sockets 
  Layer (SSL) encryption and billing facility for credit card transactions. Bookabach does not keep your credit card information in our database. For more information about DPS see <a href="http://www.dps.co.nz">www.dps.co.nz</a></p>
<h2>With whom your information is shared</h2>
  <p>The information you provide is stored in our database and used by us in accordance 
  with this Privacy Policy. We do not 
  provide customer lists or contact details to our advertisers or business partners. And will not share this information in a manner that 
  identifies you as an individual without your express permission, e.g. if you make a booking request for a bach we will pass on your contact details to a bach owner or property manager so they can contact you (and visa versa). </p>
  <p>We may from time to time hire a third party to act 
  on our behalf for projects such as market research, competition entry, and bulk email processing. We will provide information to these 
  third parties specifically for use in connection with these projects. 
  The information we provide will be protected by a confidentiality 
  agreement that will obligate the third party to use the information 
  solely to complete the specific project. </p>
<p>In addition to the circumstances described above, we may disclose 
  your information if required to do so by law, or in the good faith 
  belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable, including 
  when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information 
  is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against 
  someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, 
  whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could 
  be harmed by such activities. </p>
  <hr>
  <p>Please note that on our site we have advertisements and links 
  to other websites that may collect personal information about 
  you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices 
  or policies of such websites. We encourage you to read their privacy 
  policies as they may be materially different from our Privacy 
  Policy. </p>
  <p>If you have any concerns, questions or comment on our Privacy 
  Policy or our privacy practices please <a href="http://www.bookabach.co.nz/contacts">contact us</a>. </p>
