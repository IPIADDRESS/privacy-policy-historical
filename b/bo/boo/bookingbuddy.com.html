        <ul>
            <li>To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our site.&nbsp; For example, if you register on our site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to log into our site each time you visit.&nbsp; We also may record your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled "Save this password for automatic sign-in."&nbsp; Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes.</li>
            <li>To help us customize the content, website experience, and advertisements provided to you on our websites and on other websites across the Internet.&nbsp; For example, when you access a web page, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to recognize your browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests.&nbsp; See <span class="span_underline">Display of Advertising/Your Choices</span> <a href="#_msocom_1">[A1]</a>&nbsp;for more information about our online advertising practices and your choices.&nbsp; </li>
