  <p><i>This
  Privacy Policy was last changed January 2, 2004.</i></p>
  <p>Overview </p>
  <p>The following
  Privacy Policy explains how BookingBuddy.com. ("Booking Buddy")
  gathers and uses personal information that is provided by our customers. Our
  Privacy Policy may change from time to time and Booking Buddy reserves the
  right to change or modify our Privacy Policy at any time with or without
  notice.</p>
  <p><i>Booking
  Buddy is committed to safeguarding your privacy. We do not rent or sell our
  customer database or newsletter subscriber list to third parties.</i> We do not share
  customer information in ways different from what is disclosed in this
  statement.</p>
  <p>If you have
  any questions or concerns over the Booking Buddy Privacy Policy, please feel
  free to contact <a class="aBodyTextLink" href="mailto:privacy@bookingbuddy.com">privacy@bookingbuddy.com</a>.</p>
  <p>By accessing a
  Booking Buddy publication or by subscribing to a Booking Buddy newsletter,
  you agree to our current <a class="aBodyTextLink" href="terms.php">Terms
  of Use</a>.</p>
  <p>Site
  Registration</p>
  <p>Booking
  Buddy's registration form may, in the future, require users to provide basic
  contact and demographic information. We use or may use your contact
  information (such as e-mail address) from the registration form to send you
  newsletters and occasional information about our services and partners,
  inform you if you are the potential winner of a contest or promotion,
  personalize your experience with Booking Buddy, or investigate cases of
  suspected fraud or abuse. You may opt-out of receiving future communications;
  see the Opting-Out of Further Communications section below. </p>
  <p>In the future,
  in order to customize your experience with our e-mail newsletters, we may
  receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Booking Buddy if your
  computer supports such capabilities. Clicking on a link in a Booking Buddy
  newsletter may also be tracked on a per user basis to allow us to present
  content, which closely matches your interests. Demographic and profile data
  (such as state, zip code, age, or gender) may be used to customize your
  experience at our site or in our e-mail newsletters, showing you content and
  advertising that may best suit your needs. This information is shared with
  advertisers and other third parties on an aggregate basis only. <i>Individual
  user click behavior is never shared with third parties.</i> </p>
  <p>If, in the
  future, you enter Booking Buddy via a reward or incentive program, Booking
  Buddy may share your e-mail address with the program through which you
  entered Booking Buddy to ensure you are credited with your incentive. </p>
  <p>You may, in
  the future, also register for Booking Buddy and/or specific Booking Buddy
  newsletters at web sites operated by third parties. These third parties may
  share contact, demographic or profile data that you voluntarily provide
  during the registration process with Booking Buddy. Booking Buddy does or may
  in the future use this information in the same manner as information
  collected directly by Booking Buddy. This Privacy Policy does not bind sites
  that collect information on behalf of Booking Buddy, and Booking Buddy is not
  responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. </p>
  <p>To better
  serve you, we may also store information you present to us via e-mail or
  telephone communications with Booking Buddy's Customer Service Department.
  This information is or may be used in the same manner as information directly
  collected using Booking Buddy's registration form. We may also use
  information you provide us via e-mail or telephone to pursue the matter for
  which you contacted us. Booking Buddy also may obtain information from you in
  our online forums. This information may not be disclosed except as consistent
  with Terms of Use. </p>
  <p>In order to
  better communicate with registered users about their registration status,
  Booking Buddy may acquire information about users from third-party sources,
  including but not limited to a users mailing address. The information
  collected will only be shared, if at all, on an aggregate basis only with
  third parties. </p>
  <p>E-mail
  Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often
  receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Booking Buddy if your
  computer supports such capabilities.</p>
  <p>Data
  Sharing</p>
  <p>We will share
  aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is
  not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual
  person. </p>
  <p>Booking Buddy
  may use third parties to perform certain tasks such as package delivery.
  Personal information may be provided to these agents as is necessary to
  perform their functions. </p>
  <p>Booking Buddy
  partners with third-party companies to provide services to Booking Buddy
  users. When you sign up for one of these services, the information you
  provide in signing up for the service is shared with the third party and is
  protected in accordance with the third party's Privacy Policy. </p>
  <p>In the future,
  Booking Buddy may host content on behalf of certain other web site partners.
  These pages will be identified as they have the navigation of the partner
  site. Information collected on these pages may be shared with the partner
  site. These pages, and any information shared with the partner site, are
  subject to the Privacy Policy of the partner site. </p>
  <p>Occasionally,
  Booking Buddy may participate in reward programs. In order to properly credit
  you for your reward, we may share basic customer information with the
  reward-giver.</p>
  <p>Sweepstakes,
  Online Surveys, and Order Forms</p>
  <p>Booking Buddy
  occasionally runs sweepstakes, hosts online surveys, or uses order forms on
  our web site in which we ask for contact and demographic information.
  Participation in sweepstakes and surveys and usage of order forms is
  completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to
  disclose this information. We use or may use your contact information (such
  as e-mail address) from your sweepstakes entry, survey registration, or order
  form to inform you if you are the potential winner of a contest or promotion,
  personalize your experience with Booking Buddy, send you newsletters (should
  you opt-in for these newsletters) and occasional information about our
  services or partners, or investigate cases of suspected fraud. You may
  opt-out of receiving future communications; see the Opting-Out of Further
  Communications section below. </p>
  <p>Demographic
  and profile data (such as zip code, age, or gender) may be used to customize
  your experience at our site, showing you content and advertising that may
  best suit your needs. This information is shared with advertisers and other
  third parties on an aggregate basis only. In the event that Booking Buddy
  partners with a third party to run a sweepstakes, Booking Buddy may share
  demographic and profile data with such third party only as indicated in the
  official sweepstakes rules.  </p>
  <p>Tell-a-Friend
  and E-mail This Deal</p>
  <p>Booking Buddy
  may, from time to time, offer services to allow our users to send information
  about our site to their friends. If a user elects to use such service for
  informing a friend about our site, or elects to use our other services to
  inform a friend about information on our site, we will ask them for the
  friend's e-mail address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time
  e-mail inviting them to visit our site. We store this information for the
  purpose of sending this one-time e-mail and investigating suspected fraud. </p>
  <p>Children
  Under 13 Years Old</p>
  <p>We do not use
  our web site to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the
  age of 13. Children under 13 may not participate in any online activities on
  the Booking Buddy site. </p>
  <p>IP
  Addresses</p>
  <p>Booking Buddy
  uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our web site, and help
  diagnose problems with our servers. IP addresses are also used to gather
  broad demographic information and to prevent, investigate, and take actions
  in the case of suspected fraud or abuse. </p>
  <p>Cookies</p>
  <p>A cookie is a
  small piece of data that a web server places on a user's computer. Booking
  Buddy employs the use of cookies to ensure that you do not see the same ad
  repeatedly, to track marketing promotions, to estimate and report audience
  size and traffic, and to customize and personalize your experience at
  BookingBuddy.com.</p>
  <p>Furthermore,
  Booking Buddy may, from time to time, use outside media companies to display
  advertisements on our site. These ads may contain cookies, which are
  collected and tracked by the outside media company. Booking Buddy has no
  access to or control over these cookies.</p>
  <p>Most web
  browsers provide users the ability to limit the use of cookies by allowing
  users to adjust privacy settings. If a user has their cookies disabled,
  Booking Buddy will still be accessible, however some sections of the web site
  will not perform as well as they normally would with cookies enabled.</p>
  <p>Links to
  Other Sites</p>
  <p>BookingBuddy.com
  contains links to other web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy
  practices or the content of such web sites. We encourage you to be aware when
  you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of every web site that
  collects personally identifiable information. </p>
  <p>Security,
  Fraud, and Abuse</p>
  <p>This site has
  security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the
  information under our control. Booking Buddy regularly reviews these measures
  to better protect users. Occasionally information may be provided to Booking
  Buddy fraudulently or by an individual unauthorized to provide such
  information. Booking Buddy may use all information it collects for reasonable
  investigation and prosecution of suspected fraud and/or abuse. Booking Buddy
  may provide all information it collects to third parties as necessary to
  comply with law enforcement requests or other legal requirements. </p>
  <p>Booking Buddy
  does not ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us
  over the Internet.</p>
  <p>Service and
  Partner Updates</p>
  <p>We may send
  our users service and partner announcements from time to time. Users are not
  able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain information
  about our services and partners, without opting-out of all Booking Buddy
  newsletters. You may opt-out of receiving future communications; see the
  Opting-Out of Further Communications section below. </p>
  <p>We communicate
  with our users to provide requested services and in regards to issues
  relating to their account via e-mail, telephone, or postal mail. </p>
  <p>Notification
  of Changes</p>
  <p>If at any
  point we decide to share personally identifiable information to third parties
  FOR REASONS NOT OUTLINED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, we will notify our users by
  way of an e-mail, so that users are made aware. Users will have a choice as
  to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. </p>
