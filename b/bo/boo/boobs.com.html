 <strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
 <strong>Revised January 23, 2012</strong></p>
<p>
 Boobs.com has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of our guests and users. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for Boobs.com, and any other website we operate. Enjoy the site.</p>
<p>
 <strong>Your Acceptance of These Terms</strong><strong>/ Modifications</strong></p>
<p>
 By using the Boobs.com website, you indicate your acceptance of all terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our websites. Your continued use of the Boobs.com website following the posting of changes to these terms indicates your acceptance of those changes.</p>
<p>
 <strong>A Special Note about Children </strong></p>
<p>
 Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to use our services, and we ask that anyone under 13 please not submit any personal information to us or use the site in any manner. We believe that is important that parents supervise their children when they are online. As a result, we ask that individuals between the ages of 13 and 18 use this service only in conjunction with parents or guardians and only with their permission.</p>
<p>
 <strong>Use of Cookies </strong></p>
<p>
 Cookies are pieces of information that a Website transfers to your computer for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make browsing the Internet easier for you by saving your preferences while you access a Website. Boobs.com never saves passwords in cookies. By showing how and when users use a website, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Boobs.com web content are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our users’ needs. Boobs.com uses cookies primarily in two ways. First, we use them to specify unique preferences so that you do not have to tell us repeatedly about the content you are interested in. Secondly, we use cookies to track user trends and patterns, so we can improve areas of the Boobs.com online experience that our users find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of a cookie, visitors to Boobs.com always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please note that some parts of the Boobs.com service may not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For example, you may have difficulty entering contests, or playing games. You may occasionally get cookies directly from our advertisers. Boobs.com does not control these cookies.</p>
<p>

 If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on our site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. We would use information in the file that we maintain for you, and other information that we obtain from your use of the services, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our <u><a href="http://www.boobs.com/terms_and_conditions.php" title="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a></u>.</p>
<p>
 The personal information collected from registered users includes your name, e-mail address, IP address, mailing address, telephone number and the number of visits to the site. We also collect the information which you provide regarding your service and/or products needs.</p>
<p>
 We may use the collect personal information for various purposes, including but not limited to the following: (1) to fulfill your requests for products and services; (2) to offer products and services that may be of interest to you; (3) to customize the advertising and content that you see on our website; (4) to facilitate use of our website; (5) to manage your account and your preferences; (6) to analyze use of and improve our website, products and services; (7) to identify and protect against fraudulent transactions and other misuses of our website; and (8) to enforce our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>
 Boobs.com does not sell, trade or give away any personal information or listing information which you provide, other than the information which you volunteer for your particular listing, and only for the purposes specifically described there.</p>
<p>
 We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.</p>
<p>
 <strong>Linked Sites</strong></p>
<p>
 For your convenience, this website contains links to other websites. Boobs.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. Users should be aware that when they are on Boobs.com, they could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from Boobs.com pages that take you outside our service. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, doing so may direct you off of Boobs.com. Such other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Whenever you give out personal information online (for example, via message boards or chat rooms) information can be collected and used by other people. While Boobs.com strives to protect our users' personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>
 <strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>
 This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All user information is stored on a server operated by a third party, using standard security measures. Notwithstanding these efforts, we caution you that “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet and therefore you share information at your own risk.</p>
