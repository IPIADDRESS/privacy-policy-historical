<p class="SCIntroText">BooksOnBoard (referred to herein as "We",  "Our"  or "Us") considers the protection of your personal information a  top  priority when you ("You" or "Your") use Our BooksOnBoard Service. If You   decide to access the BooksOnBoard Service, Your visit and any dispute  over  privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and Our <a href="../index.php?F=terms-of-use">Terms and Conditions</a> of Use. Our Policy regarding the collection, use and disclosure, if   any, of personal information can be broken down into the 10 principles   covered in Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic   Documents Act ("PIPEDA").</p>
<h3 class="SCTextSubheader">1. ACCOUNTABILITY</h3>
<ul style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5em; padding-left: 16px;">
<li>We are responsible for personal information under Our control.</li>
<li>All Our employees are responsible for day-to-day compliance.</li>
<li>When We use trusted third parties, including Our  affiliates and  subsidiaries, to act on Our behalf by performing such  functions as  fulfilling orders, delivering packages, processing credit  card payments  or providing customer service, contractual or other  appropriate means  are used to ensure compliance by such third parties  with this Policy  and all applicable privacy laws.</li>
<li>Our Website may contain links to other websites. We  are not  responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We  encourage  Our users to be aware when they leave Our site to read the  privacy  statements of each and every web site that collects personally   identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to   information collected by Us pursuant to the BooksOnBoard Service. Please  review  the <a href="../index.php?F=terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> for more information..</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(a) User Accounts and Personal Information</strong></p>
<ul style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5em; padding-left: 16px;">
<li>Purchasing and submitting content from the BooksOnBoard Service  requires a user to register for an account. Personal information  is  required, including Your real name, email address, password, home  address, and country of residence. If You are logged in, You will be  identified by  Your user name. This may be Your real name if You so  choose, or You may  choose to publish under a pseudonym, whatever user  name You selected  when You created Your account.</li>
<li>When making a purchase on BooksOnBoard We will ask You for  more information as is necessary to complete Your purchase.</li>
<li>We ask for some personal information when You create  a BooksOnBoard  user account, including Your email address and a password, which  is  used to protect Your account from unauthorized access.</li>
<li>We may record information about Your usage, such as  when and how  often You use the BooksOnBoard Service as well as information You   display or click on within the BooksOnBoard Service (including UI  elements,  settings, and other information), and may share this  information to  trusted third parties, including Our publishers or other  suppliers of  content. </li>
<li>We may use Your usage information to vary Your  experience. For  example, We may present content that We think would be  of interest to  You, based on the information We record about Your usage.</li>
<li>When You visit BooksOnBoard, We will collect Your browser type and  IP address and may use that information to vary Your experience.</li>
<li>If You are logged in, We may associate that information with Your account.</li>
<li>Any personal information or content that You  voluntarily disclose  online (in comments, reviews, etc.) becomes  publicly available and can  be collected and used by others. If You  contribute to the BooksOnBoard  Service, You are publishing every word You post  publicly. If You write  something, assume that it may be retained  forever.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(b) Email</strong></p>
<ul style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5em; padding-left: 16px;">
<li>When You create a BooksOnBoard account, You can select  whether We   can send You emails related  to the BooksOnBoard Service or the products  purchased by You. You can change  this option at any time via Your <a href="../account/index.php?BODY=details">Account Settings</a>.</li>
<li>We reserve the right to send You important account  related emails  from time to time even if You have opted not to receive  emails from us.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(c) Passwords</strong></p>
<ul style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5em; padding-left: 16px;">
<li>Your User account is protected by a password chosen by You. Passwords protect the integrity of Your account.</li>
<li>All Users are encouraged to select strong passwords  and never to  share them. You are prohibited from knowingly exposing the  password of  another User to public release either directly or  indirectly.</li>
<li>Protect against unauthorized access to Your password  and to Your  computer by logging off once You have finished using a  shared computer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(d) Children Under 18 Years of Age</strong></p>
<ul style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5em; padding-left: 16px;">
<li>You must be 13 years and older to register to use  the BooksOnBoard  Service. As a result, the BooksOnBoard Service does not specifically   collect information about children. If We learn that the BooksOnBoard  Service  has collected information from a child under the age of 13, We  will  delete that information as quickly as possible. Minors between the  ages  of 13 and the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which such  minor  resides must receive their parents' permission before using  BooksOnBoard or  sending information about themselves or anyone else  over the Internet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(e) Cookies</strong></p>
<ul style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5em; padding-left: 16px;">
<li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that We  transfer to Your  computer's hard drive through Your Web browser to  enable Our systems to  recognize Your browser and tell Us how and when  pages in Our website  are visited and by how many people. BooksOnBoard cookies do  not collect  personal information, and We do not combine information  collected  through cookies with other personal information to tell Us who  You are  or what Your screen name or e-mail address is. </li>
<li>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of  browsers will  direct You on how to prevent Your browser from accepting  new cookies,  how to command the browser to tell You when You receive a  new cookie,  or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that You leave  the  cookies activated because cookies may allow You to make use of some   BooksOnBoard Service features. </li>
<li>Some of Our business partners, like Our advertisers,  may use  cookies on Our website. We have no access to, or control over,  these  cookies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(f) Private Logging</strong></p>
<ul style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5em; padding-left: 16px;">
<li>Every time You visit a web page, You send  information to the web  server. Most web servers routinely maintain  access logs with a portion  of this information, which can be used to get  an overall picture of  what pages are popular, what other sites link to  this one, and what web  browsers people are using. </li>
<li>These logs are used to produce site statistics; the raw log data is not made public. </li>
<li>Log data may be examined by developers and  administrators in the  course of solving technical problems and in  tracking down badly-behaved  web spiders that overwhelm the site. IP  addresses of Users, derived  either from those logs or from records in  the database are frequently  used to correlate usernames and network  addresses in investigating  abuse of the BooksOnBoard Service, including  vandalism, harassment of  other users, or other disruptions of the site.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="SCTextSubheader">2. IDENTIFYING PURPOSES</h3>
<ul style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5em; padding-left: 16px;">
<li>We collect Your personal information for the general  purpose of  providing You with the BooksOnBoard Service as described in the  Terms  of Use and for any specific purposes identified in, or in  accordance  with, this Policy. Without limiting the foregoing, we collect  personal  information in order to fulfill Your orders, process Your  payments,  collect amounts You owe, respond to Your requests for  information and  service, communicate with You, conduct internal research  to understand  Your needs and improve Our service, enforce Our Terms of  Use; manage  and administer Our BooksOnBoard business, where required, to provide   sales reports to Our publishers and other suppliers of content, and as   otherwise required or permitted by law. </li>
<li>Unless the purpose is self-evident due to the nature  of the  transaction in question, We will identify the purposes for which   personal information is collected at or before the time the information   is collected.</li>
<li>The proposed purposes will be described in a reasonably understandable manner.</li>
<li>An example of a self-evident purpose is requesting  the name and  address of the person during the BooksOnBoard Service registration   process in order to provide such User with access to the service.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="SCTextSubheader">3. CONSENT</h3>
<ul style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5em; padding-left: 16px;">
<li>We will collect, use or disclose Your personal  information only  with Your knowledge and consent, except where required  or permitted by  law or this Policy.</li>
<li>We will not make Your consent a requirement to the  supply of a  product or a service other than required to be able to  supply the  product or service.</li>
<li>Consent can be express or, in some circumstances,  implied, and  given in writing, by using or not using a check-off box,   electronically, orally (in person or by telephone), or by Your conduct,   such as use of a product or service. </li>
<li>In determining the type of consent to obtain, We  will consider all  relevant factors, including the sensitivity of the  information and Your  reasonable expectations. </li>
<li>You may withdraw Your consent at any time, on  reasonable notice,  subject to legal or contractual restrictions. We will  inform You of the  implications of doing so. Your withdrawal will apply  to future  collection, use or disclosure only.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="SCTextSubheader">4. LIMITING COLLECTION</h3>
<ul style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5em; padding-left: 16px;">
<li>Our collection of personal information will be  limited to what is  necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy or  which we otherwise  identify at or before the time of collection.</li>
<li>We will collect personal information by fair and lawful means.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="SCTextSubheader">5. LIMITING USE, DISCLOSURE, AND RETENTION</h3>
<ul style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5em; padding-left: 16px;">
<li>Personal information will not be used or disclosed  for purposes  other than those for which it was collected, except with  Your consent  or as required or permitted by law or this Policy.</li>
<li>It will be retained only as long as necessary for these purposes or as required by law.</li>
<li>For greater certainty, without limiting the  generality of the  foregoing, it is Our policy that personally  identifiable data collected  in the BooksOnBoard Service server logs may be  released by Our system  administrators in the following situations:                       <ol style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5em; padding-left: 20px;">
<li>In response to a court order, subpoena or other compulsory legal process;</li>
<li>With permission of the affected User;</li>
<li>To Our executives, legal counsel, or their designees, when necessary for investigation of abuse complaints;</li>
<li>Where the information pertains to page views  generated by a spider  or bot and its dissemination is necessary to  illustrate or resolve  technical issues;</li>
<li>Where the User is causing damage or degradation  to the BooksOnBoard  Service or persistently behaving in a disruptive way, data  may be  released to assist in the targeting of IP blocks, or to assist in  the  formulation of a complaint to the relevant Internet Service  Providers;</li>
<li>Where it is reasonably necessary to protect Our  rights, property or  safety, or the rights, property or safety of the  Users of the  BooksOnBoard Service or the public;</li>
<li>To trusted third parties, including Our  affiliates and  subsidiaries, who act on Our behalf in providing the BooksOnBoard   Service, and to  Our publishers and other suppliers of content (in which  case contractual  or other appropriate means will be used to ensure  compliance by such  third parties with this Policy and all applicable  privacy laws). </li>
</ol> </li>
<li>In addition, Your personal information may be used  and disclosed or  transferred to one or more other parties, including Our  affiliates and  subsidiaries, (individually, a "Third Party") during the  course of a  purchase and sale transaction, merger, amalgamation,  consolidation,  joint venture or other type of business combination,  reorganization or  restructuring or financing of all or part of Our  business or assets (a  "business transaction"), including for the purpose  of permitting a  Third Party to determine whether to proceed with such  business  transaction.</li>
<li>In such case, We will disclose Your personal information only if:                    <ol style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5em; padding-left: 20px;">
<li>the personal information is necessary for the  parties to determine  whether to proceed with the business transaction  and, if the  determination is to proceed, to carry out and complete the  business  transaction;</li>
<li>the Third Party has entered into an appropriate  agreement under  which the use and disclosure of Your personal  information is restricted  to:                        <ol style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5em; padding-left: 20px;">

<li>(ii) where the business transaction  is completed, those purposes  for which the information was initially  collected or subsequently  authorized by You;</li>
</ol> </li>
<li>the disclosure is only of personal information collected by Us as part of the BooksOnBoard Service; and</li>
<li>where the business transaction is completed, such  Third Party is  required to continue to use and disclose Your personal  information in a  manner that is, in all material respects, consistent  with the  provisions of this Policy, unless You consent otherwise.  Subject to any  legal and contractual restrictions, You will be notified  as soon as  reasonably possible following the completion of any business   transaction during which, or as a result of which, Your personal   information was transferred or disclosed to a Third Party. You agree   that such notice may be given by posting an announcement on the  BooksOnBoard  Website.</li>
</ol> </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="SCTextSubheader">6. ACCURACY</h3>
<ul style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5em; padding-left: 16px;">
<li>We will keep Your personal information as accurate,  complete and  up-to-date as necessary for the purposes for which it is to  be used.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="SCTextSubheader">7. SAFEGUARDS</h3>
<ul style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5em; padding-left: 16px;">
