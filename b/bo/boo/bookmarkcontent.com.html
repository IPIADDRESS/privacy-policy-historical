<p>–&nbsp; We may disclose your personal information if we or any of our assets are the subject of a sale or similar corporate transaction. We will ensure that the third parties who receive your personal information are required to keep it confidential.</p>

<h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
<p>By using our website, you are agreeing to our use of cookies as described in this notice.</p>
<h3>What are cookies?</h3>
<p>We may use information obtained from cookies or similar technology. Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information, which we download onto your computer or device when you visit our website. Therefore, when we refer to “you” in this section, we mean your computer. We can recognize these cookies on subsequent visits and they allow us to remember you.</p>
<p>Cookies come in many forms. We have set out the main types and categories of cookies that are used below. This section refers to all types and categories of cookies and not just those we use on our website.</p>
<p><strong>First and third-party cookies</strong> – whether a cookie is first-party or third-party refers to the domain placing the cookie. First-party cookies are those set by a website that is being visited by the user, the website displayed in the URL window. Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website, this would be a third-party cookie.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent cookies</strong> – these cookies remain on a user’s device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.</p>
<p><strong>Session cookie</strong> – these cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.</p>
<h3>What do we use cookies for?</h3>
<p>Cookies fall into one or more of the categories set out below.</p>
<p><strong>1. Strictly necessary cookies – these cookies enable services you have specifically asked for.</strong></p>
<p>These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies, certain services you have asked for cannot be provided.</p>
<p>This website uses cookies in this category.</p>
<p><strong>2. Performance cookies – these cookies collect information on the pages visited.</strong></p>
<p>These cookies collect information about how users use a website. For instance, which pages users go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. They are only used to improve how the website works.</p>
<p>This website uses cookies in this category.</p>
<p><strong>3. Functionality cookies – these cookies remember choices you make to improve your experience.</strong></p>
<p>These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make and provide enhanced, more personal features. They may also be used to help provide services you have asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized, and they cannot track your browsing activity to other websites.</p>
<p>This website uses cookies in this category.</p>
<p><strong>4. Targeting cookies or advertising cookies – these cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your interests.</strong></p>
<p>These cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement, as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website, and this information is shared with other organizations, such as advertisers. Quite often, targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization.</p>
<p>This website doesn’t use cookies in this category.</p>
<h3>What cookies do we use?</h3>
<p><strong>Performance/analytics/tracking:</strong> this type of cookie provides aggregated information about where a user may go on the website.</p>
<p>• Google Analytics. Bookmark Content and Communications uses Google Analytics to help us analyse how visitors use the website. Among other things, Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information about the number of visits to the website, the webpage that referred visitors to the website, language, device, browser and operating system, the pages visitors view within the website and other similar details. We do not share this information with third parties. When used this way the Google Analytics cookie is a persistent cookie, and will remain on your device until the cookie expires or you delete it. These cookies may appear as _utma, _utmb, _utmc, _utmz, _utmv, _utmt.</p>
<p>• We also use Google Analytics as a session cookie. This cookie may appear as has_js. We do not retain this data as it is deleted upon closing of your browser, and therefore we cannot share it with any third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Social media/sharing: </strong>these are cookies that help with the website’s functionality. These are third party cookies, and they allow you to share comments, pages, bookmarks, and likes, and help to provide access to social networking tools easily.</p>
