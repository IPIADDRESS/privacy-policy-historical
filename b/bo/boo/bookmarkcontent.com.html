<p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<h3>What Are Cookies?</h3>
<p>We may use information obtained from cookies or similar technology. Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information, which we download onto your computer or device when you visit our website. Therefore, when we refer to “you” in this section, we mean your computer. We can recognize these cookies on subsequent visits and they allow us to remember you.</p>
<p>Cookies come in many forms. We have set out the main types and categories of cookies that are used below. This section refers to all types and categories of cookies and not just those we use on our website.</p>
<p><strong>First and third-party cookies</strong> – whether a cookie is first-party or third-party refers to the domain placing the cookie. First-party cookies are those set by a website that is being visited by the user, the website displayed in the URL window e.g. www.bookmarkcontent.com. Third-Party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website, this would be a third-party cookie.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent cookies</strong> – these cookies remain on a user’s device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.</p>
<p><strong>Session cookie</strong> – these cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.</p>
<h3>What do we use cookies for?</h3>
<p>Cookies fall into one or more of the categories set out below. This website uses cookies that fall into all the categories. Also, we use data from targeting cookies placed on your computer by third parties when you have visited other websites.</p>
<p><strong>1. Strictly necessary cookies</strong> – These cookies enable services you have specifically asked for.</p>
<p>These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies, certain services you have asked for cannot be provided.</p>
<p><strong>2. Performance cookies</strong> – These cookies collect information on the pages visited.</p>
<p>These cookies collect information about how users use a website. For instance, which pages users go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. They are only used to improve how the website works.</p>
<p><strong>3. Functionality cookies</strong> – These cookies remember choices you make to improve your experience.</p>
<p>These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make and provide enhanced, more personal features. They may also be used to help provide services you have asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized, and they cannot track your browsing activity to other websites.</p>
<p><strong>4. Targeting cookies or advertising cookies</strong> – these cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your interests.</p>
<p>These cookies are used to deliver advertisements&nbsp;more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement, as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website, and this information is shared with other organizations, such as advertisers. Quite often, targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization.</p>
<p>If you want to delete any cookies that may already be on your computer or device, please refer to the instructions for your file management software to locate the file or directory that stores cookies. If you want to stop cookies from being stored on your computer in the future, please refer to your browser manufacturer’s instructions by clicking “Help” in your browser menu. Further information on cookies is available at allaboutcookies.org. By deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our website.</p>
<h2>Third-party websites</h2>
<p>Our website links to third-party sites which we do not operate or endorse. These websites may use cookies and collect your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. This privacy policy does not apply to third-party websites, and we are not responsible for third-party websites.</p>
<h2>How do we protect your information?</h2>
<p>We take appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information disclosed to us is kept secure, accurate and up to date and kept only for so long as is necessary for the purposes for which it is used.</p>
<p><strong>Links to other websites</strong></p>
<p>Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information you provide while visiting such sites, and this privacy statement does not govern such sites. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.</p>
<p><strong>Controlling your personal information</strong></p>
<p>You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>whenever you are asked to fill in a form on the website, look for the box that you can click to indicate that you do not want the information to be used by anybody for direct marketing purposes</li>
<li>if you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by writing to or emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@bookmarkcontent.com">info@bookmarkcontent.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so. We may use your personal information to send you promotional information about third parties, which we think you may find interesting, if you tell us that you wish this to happen.</p>
<p>You may request details of personal information, which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998. A small fee will be payable. If you would like a copy of the information held on you, please write to Bookmark Content and Communications, 2 Bloor Street East, Suite 1020, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M4W 1A8.</p>
