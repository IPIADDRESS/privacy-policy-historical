<p align="center">PRIVACY POLICY</p> 
</b> 
<p>Last Updated: July 25, 2009</p> 
<p>www.BoostSeminar.com, strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an 
interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable 
Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) 
subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent 
your email address to any unauthorized third party. Period."</p> 
<b> 
<p>How we gather information from users</p> 
</b> 
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, 
the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For 
example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to 
certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or 
when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in 
sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive 
areas of our site. Like most Web sites, www.BoostSeminar.com, also collects information automatically and 
through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For 
example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie 
technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other 
things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from 
having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the 
number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our 
site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through 
other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with 
information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, 
but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be 
asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to 
customize the siteâ€™s features according to your preferences.</p> 
<b> 
<p>What we do with the information we collect</p> 
</b> 
<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and 
deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and 
do not share your information with anyone.</p> 
<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) 
may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your 
usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help 
enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or 
what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be 
shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does 
not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to 
identify you individually.</p> 
<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on 
www.BoostSeminar.com, to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of 
Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by 
www.BoostSeminar.com, and other topics we think you might find of interest. </p> 
<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by 
www.BoostSeminar.com, may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of 
e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other 
communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for 
the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such 
information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, 
from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, 
merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user 
information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your 
information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are 
reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of 
amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we 
deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice 
prior to disclosure in such cases.</p> 
<b>

advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the 
advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. 
Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third 
parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.
