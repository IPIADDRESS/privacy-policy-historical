<div align="justify">Because we
gather information about the customers of Boozt.com we feel you should fully
understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that
information.</div><br>

<span class="article">Information Boozt.com gathers and tracks</span><br>

<div align="justify">Boozt.com
gathers two types of information about users: 1) Data that users provide
through optional, voluntary registration on our site, and 2) aggregated
tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our site.
Such information enables us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and
help us better understand the demographics of our audience and customers.</div>

Boozt collects the following information from purchases through the online store:
<ul>
	<li>Name</li>
	<li>Address</li>
	<li>Email Address</li>
	<li>Telephone</li>
	<li>Fax</li>
	<li>Software Purchased</li>
	<li>Software Registration Code (where applicable)</li>
</ul>

<div align="justify">This
information is provided on the contractual understanding that it is to be used
solely and exclusively for the purpose of tracking customer software
registrations and providing technical support, as is the standard practice in
the industry.</div><br>

<span class="article">Boozt.com does not provide this information to any other
third parties under any circumstances.</span><br>

<div align="justify">Questions regarding this statement should be directed to <a href="mailto:privacy@boozt.com">privacy@Boozt.com</a></div><br>

<span class="article">Electronic Newsletters</span><br>

<div align="justify">Boozt.com
offers free electronic newsletters to users. Boozt.com gathers the e-mail
addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Customers may remove themselves
from any mailing list by following the instructions contained in every
newsletter.</div><br>

<span class="article">Usage tracking</span><br>

<div align="justify">Boozt.com
tracks user traffic patterns throughout Boozt.com and this information is
correlated with data about individual users. Overall usage statistics,
according to a user's domain name, browser type and MIME type gotten by reading
this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's
browser), are also broken down.</div><br>

<div align="justify">Boozt.com also
tracks and catalogs the search terms that customers enter into our search
tools, but this tracking is never associated with individual users.</div><br>

<span class="article">Cookies</span><br>

<div align="justify">A cookie is a
small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit
them. A cookie file can contain information such including a user ID that the
site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information
a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read
data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Boozt.com
uses cookies to track the items you add to your shopping card and to enforce security
rules regarding software that you download.</div><br>

<div align="justify">If you've set
your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning
message with each cookie.</div><br>

<div align="justify">You can refuse
cookies by turning them off in your browser. However, you need to have cookies
turned on to purchase software through Boozt.com.</div><br>

<span class="article">Use of the information</span><br>

<div align="justify">Boozt.com uses
any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience on
our site, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites
or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.</div><br>

<div align="justify">As stated
above, Boozt.com uses information that users voluntarily provide in order to
send out electronic newsletters and enable users to participate in polls and
message boards. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule
(daily or weekly, depending on the newsletter) and occasionally send out
special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in
something we are doing. Boozt.com never shares newsletter mailing lists with
any third parties, including advertisers or partners.</div><br>

<div align="justify">We use
tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't
like based on traffic to those areas. Boozt.com does not track what individual
users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us
continue to build a better service for you.</div><br>

<div align="justify">We track
search terms entered in our search function as one of many measures of what
interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.</div><br>

<div align="justify">Boozt.com
creates aggregrate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for
advertisers and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more
effectively and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent
to their needs. Boozt.com never shares individual personal information with
anyone, so an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked their ad.</div><br>


<div align="justify">Boozt.com uses
the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and
help our advertisers better understand our audience demographics. We do not
share information about individual users with any third party, with the
exceptions noted previously.</div><br>

<div align="justify">Questions
regarding this statement should be directed to <a href="mailto:privacy@boozt.com">privacy@Boozt.com</a></div><br>
