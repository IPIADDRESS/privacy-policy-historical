<p>This privacy policy (together with our&nbsp;Data Protection Policy&nbsp;and any other documents referred to in it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data.</p>

<p>It is sometimes necessary the Company to transfer information held about you to lenders based outside of the European Economic Area. The Eighth Data Protection Principle of the Act restricts the transfer of personal data to a country outside the European Economic Area unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. By submitting your Application Form you consent to this transfer. You may withdraw your consent at a later date by writing to us at <a href="mailto:info@atrinsic.com">info@atrinsic.com</a><br>
<strong>Will we share your information?</strong></p>
<p>We may pass your details on to third parties for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selected third parties and agents who provide administration support and/or the website services and who agree to only hold such information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and under strict conditions to safeguard your information;</li>

<p><strong>How can I update, correct or delete my information?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are Cookies?</strong></p>
<p>A “cookie” is a piece of information that is stored on your hard drive by your web browser that allows the website to recognise you over several different pages.</p>
<p>Our web site uses “cookies” to help you navigate through the web site more easily and to understand the services you are using. That information is automatically deleted if you close your web browser or leave the web site for a sufficient period of time (typically after 30 minutes although this may vary from time to time).</p>
<p>The cookie information may show us which pages, functions or services are seen or used, which are the most popular areas of the website, when the website was accessed and for how long, and whether the user returns to the site. This information is not personally identifiable and will be used by us to administer the website systems, to compile statistics, and help us develop and improve the site and our services.</p>
<p>If you wish, you can usually adjust your browser so that your computer does not accept cookies. If you do this, you will still be able to browse around the general site but the functions that allow you to log on to the secure website may not be available. Alternatively you can adjust your browser to tell you when a website tries to put a cookie on your computer. How you adjust your browser to stop it accepting cookies or to notify you of them, will depend on the type of internet browser programme your computer uses. If your computer uses Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, you will need to follow these instructions after clicking onto this link&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>&nbsp;(Atrinsic is not responsible for the content of external websites. This link will open a new window.) Go to the heading “Manage Cookies”. Click onto the option you prefer, either stopping cookies being installed, or notifying you of them. From the list provided, click onto the programme which your computer uses. If this is not shown on the list, click on the “help” heading on the bar at the top of this page, search for information on “cookies” – an explanation of how to delete cookies will appear, then follow these instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do we protect your personal information?</strong></p>
<p>Your access to the secure area of the website services is password-protected so that only you should have access to any personal information you provide there.</p>
