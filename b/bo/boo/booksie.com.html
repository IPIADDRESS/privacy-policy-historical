<p><strong>Cookies:</strong>&nbsp;A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer
 or mobile device. When you use the Service, or visit a Partner Site using the Service, we send
  one or more cookies to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Cookies help you 
  log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. We also use cookies to collect 
  Technical Data and information about how you use the Service and Partner Sites (e.g., the 
  pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take), to track your usage of the
   Service on Partner Sites over time, and to personalize the content we show you, including

cookies, which remain on your hard drive after you close your browser, and session cookies
 which terminate when you close your browser. Many browser settings can be set to decline
  cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie. If you have questions
   about such functionalities, you should consult with your browser’s manufacturer. However, 
   some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is
    disabled.&nbsp;</p>

        such information.</p>

clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to collect Technical Data and information 
such as online usage patterns. We may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users

      ve interacted within order to provide you with more relevant advertising targeted to your 
      preferences and interests derived from your interaction with the Service, Partner Sites or other 
      third party websites. Booksie may also send you email newsletters and email marketing messages
       if you have provided us with permission, or consented to receive such emails, as required in 
       the jurisdiction in which you reside. Email marketing messages may be tailored to your interests
        based on the information described above in this section.&nbsp;</p>

  reporting requirements.</p>

  nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised 
  use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal 
  data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal
   requirements.</p>
   
   <h2>9. SECURITY</h2>

    information collected through the Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable

 <h2>10. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
 
 <p>California law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to request
  information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal data 
  with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Because our Privacy Policy gives you a
   choice of opting out of having your contact information disclosed to third parties for their
    own direct marketing purposes, we may instead provide you with information on how to exercise 
    your preferences To request such information, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@booksie.com">privacy@booksie.com</a>.
    
    
    </p><h2>11. EEA DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS REGARDING PERSONAL DATA.</h2>
    
    <p>Under certain circumstances and depending on where you are based, you have rights under
     data protection 
    laws in relation to your Personal Data. &nbsp;You have the right to:</p>
    
    <p><strong>i.&nbsp;Request access</strong>&nbsp;to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access 
    request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check 
    that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
    
<p><strong>ii.&nbsp;Request correction</strong>&nbsp;of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables
you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to
 verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
 
<p><strong>iii.&nbsp;Request erasure</strong>&nbsp;of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete
 or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have
  the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised 
  your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully
   or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however,
that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons 
which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>iv. Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a
 legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular
  situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on 
  your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing
   your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
    compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
    
<p><strong>v.&nbsp;Request restriction</strong> of processing&nbsp;of your personal data. This enables you to
 ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want
  us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want
   us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need
    it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data
     but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
     
<p><strong>vi.&nbsp;Request the transfer</strong>&nbsp;of your personal data to you or to a third party. </p>
