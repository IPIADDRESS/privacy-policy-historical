    <h3>25. Subscription to our Newsletter</h3>
    <p class="justify">Our website allows you to subscribe to our newsletter. The personal data that is transmitted to the Controller for the purpose of ordering the newsletter results from the input mask used for this.</p>
    <p class="justify">We will inform you at regular intervals by means of a newsletter about important changes in connection with the contract or about new and recommended books on our platform. In principle, our newsletter can only be received if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the newsletter. For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered for the newsletter for the first time in the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address has authorized the receiving of the newsletter as the person concerned.</p>
    <p class="justify">When registering for the newsletter, we store the IP address of the Internet service provider (ISP) of the computer system used by the data subject at the time of registration and the date and time of registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to be able to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of an affected person at a later date and therefore serves the legal protection.</p>
    <p class="justify">The personal data collected as part of an application for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter. Furthermore, subscribers to the newsletter could be informed by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in this regard, as in the case of changes to the Newsletter offer or the change of the technical circumstances. The personal data collected within the scope of the newsletter service will not be passed on to third parties. The subscription to our newsletter can be terminated by the person concerned at any time. Consent to the storage of personal data, which the person concerned has granted us for the newsletter, can also be revoked at any time. For the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe at any time directly on the website of the controller of the newsletter or to communicate this to the controller in other ways.</p>
    
    <h3>26. Newsletter-Tracking</h3>
    <p class="justify">The newsletters, contain so-called web beacons. A web beacons is a miniature graphic that is embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format in order to enable a log file recording and a log file analysis. This allows a statistical evaluation of the success or failure of marketing campaigns. Using the embedded counting pixel, we can see if and when an e-mail was opened.</p>
    <p class="justify">Such personal data collected via the Web beacons contained in the mailings are stored and evaluated by us or our contractors in order to optimize the mailing delivery and to improve the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the Person concerned. This personal data is only used for the described purpose and is never passed on to third parties.</p>
    
    <h3>27. Newsletter unsubscription (opt-out)</h3>
