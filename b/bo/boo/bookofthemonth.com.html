How does that feel?</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you so much! It feels pretty amazing, because BOTM has just broken my 23-year streak of not winning literary prizes. The last time I won something was a short fiction prize in college, and that was pretty small time compared to this. I particularly love that it's a readers' award. I'm truly honored that so many BOTM readers thought my book was the best they read this year.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Judge Nina Sankovitch described <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/best-books-of-the-year/all-the-ugly-and-wonderful-things-140\"><em>All the Ugly and Wonderful Things</em></a> as “one of the strangest but most genuine and unforgettable love stories you’ll ever read”.  Do you agree with this description?</strong></p>\n<p>I do not deny that it's a strange love story, not least of which because the central relationship encompasses a whole variety of different forms of love. It starts out with the awkward and intense love of two strangers who connect in a moment of crisis. From there it grows into an almost fraternal love, and then into that insular closeness we associate with two people being best friends. The kind of love that lets you be in companionable silence with another person, or be hundreds of miles away and still feel connected. After that, it veers sharply into the passionate love that we usually mean when we talk about a love story. I often think the book is both a testament to and a warning about the power of unconditional love, because the two main characters make some terrible sacrifices for each other.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Dec_BrynGreenwood.jpg\" alt=\"bryn\" /></p>\n<p><strong>The book focuses on an unconventional (and controversial) relationship between a young girl named Wavy and an older man named Kellen.  What in particular do you think draws readers to the story so strongly?</strong></p>\n<p>I suspect it's the same thing that compelled me to write it. When I met Wavy and Kellen in the process of writing, I had an instant sympathy for them. He was badly injured. She was hungry. They were both incredibly lonely and I knew it had been a long time since anyone recognized their humanity. I think we've all been lonely in ways that made us feel empty and invisible. When you're that kind of alone and you find someone who sees you and cares for you without judgment or expectation, it's transformative. Wavy is a withdrawn child whose life has been narrowed by the chaos of her mother's mental illness, and the burden of raising her little brother. Kellen is an aimless thug without a future who doesn't value himself, because no one else does. Together, they become more, because of each other, for each other. She blossoms into a curious and caring girl, and he grows into someone who takes on adult responsibilities and makes plans for two unprotected children. We want transformation in our lives, and witnessing it in others is compelling.</p>\n<p>To connect this question with the previous one, I think my book has caused controversy in part because of our generally narrow views about love. We so often think there's only one kind of <em>falling in love</em>, but I'm convinced there are many. Kellen describes himself as having loved Wavy the first time he saw her, a thing that scandalizes some readers, because they interpret that as him having romantic feelings about her when she's a small child. I don't honestly understand that assumption. Love at first sight isn't exclusive to sexual love, or it hasn't been for me.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve said that the book is inspired by a relationship you had growing up.  What was it like experiencing deep feelings for a much older man?  Were people around you accepting of the relationship?</strong></p>\n<p>That relationship was incredibly liberating, because for the first time, someone accepted me for who I was. I grew up in a small town and I spent my childhood being an outcast. Even in my family I was a weirdo. Being with someone who thought I was interesting and funny increased my sense of self-worth, and made the horrible parts of adolescence seem less important. On a more shallow note: he had a nice car, no curfew, and money to spend on me. Seventh grade boys did not.</p>\n<p>We mostly kept the relationship a secret, because we knew it was illegal, and we didn't want to lose each other. As an adult, I went on keeping it a secret, because I learned the hard way that people are comfortable judging a relationship they know nothing about. The downside of that relationship was that it gave me such high expectations that future partners often disappointed me. The upside was that it gave me the strength to protect myself from the kinds of damaging relationships so many of my peers fell into in high school and college. It's hard to bully a girl into having sex with you, when she's been in a relationship where her decisions about her body were respected absolutely.</p>\n<p><strong>The book takes place around a meth lab and a lot of the characters are unsavory.  Your father was a drug dealer at one point -- are the characters based on people you knew?</strong></p>\n<p>As with nearly every character I write, they draw on some personality traits and aspects of people I've known. And I have known some unsavory people through my father's career choices. Drug dealers always have hangers on, people who simply show up and get whatever they can before moving on. So that whole environment of parties full of random strangers informed my writing. However, when I'm writing characters, it's never a direct correlation. I wouldn't take a real person and cast them in a story. It's more that I'm using bits and pieces of people I've known to flesh out characters. For example, Sandy is made up of all kinds of people. My late stepmother, who was a feisty blond. A stripper I taught in an English class, who sounded sweet as pie, even when she was being mean. Val isn't my mother; she's a dozen different women I met when I worked at a domestic violence shelter. Liam isn't my father; he's an ex-boyfriend, an old drug dealer of mine, a homeless guy who used to mow my lawn, and a professor I hated.</p>\n<p><strong>Some people have compared the book to <em>Lolita</em>, but we see a lot of differences.  How would you compare and contrast the two?</strong></p>\n<p>I suspect people go to that comparison because my book has one glaring thing in common with <em>Lolita</em>: a relationship between an adult man and a thirteen-year-old girl that becomes sexual. Beyond that single plot element, I don't see any similarities. Lolita is narrated exclusively by Humbert, a middle-aged upper-class narcissist, a pedophile, and a predator. Kellen is none of those things--not even a pedophile, I would argue. He is a young man, working poor, with little education. He may fail at any number of points to make good decisions, but he is in fact trying to do the right thing for Wavy. Nabokov, brilliantly, gives us only Humbert's perspective of events, and it's pretty clear from early on that the reader should not trust his account or his motivations. Kellen is neither the primary nor the definitive narrator in my book. In fact, my reasons for wanting to give so many perspectives are related to how I felt upon reading <em>Lolita</em> for the first time as a pre-teen. I left it feeling commodified and deeply distrustful of men. Because Lolita is never allowed to speak, it was important for me that Wavy tell her story.</p>\n<p><strong><em>All the Ugly and Wonderful Things</em> contains chapters from different characters’ points of view.  That’s a popular form these days.  Did you consider other structures?</strong></p>\n<p>Honestly, I didn't. I'm just happy that multiple point-of-view narration is popular now. Fifteen years ago, when I was sending out novels with three and four narrators, agents and editors were coming back to me and saying, &quot;That doesn't really work for us.&quot; (A famous editor once told me that multiple narrators were &quot;too complicated&quot; for readers.) I've always written from multiple points of view, because I love how it allows me to reveal layers--truths that characters don't even know about themselves. I took it to the extreme with <em>All the Ugly and Wonderful Things</em>, which has sixteen narrators, because I wanted it to feel like a documentary. Due to the nature of the story, it seemed disingenuous to only tell it from the main characters' perspectives.</p>\n<p><strong>Judging from your Instagram account, you love boxers.  Are they the cutest dogs?</strong></p>\n<p>They're not just the cutest dogs. They're the best dogs! They're incredibly loving and silly. They don't wag their tails, they wag their whole bodies. I can take the trash out and when I come back in, I'm greeted with the same level of joy that I'd get if I were gone for a month.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"www.bookoftheyear.com\">Our Book of the Year</a> statue is called “<a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/magazine/introducing-the-lolly-191\">The Lolly</a>” after the first book ever selected by Book of the Month back in 1926.

At the time, BOTM judges voted to decide on monthly selections. Warner's book won by a large margin, even though the author was virtually unknown.</p>\n<p>When told that <em>Lolly Willowes</em> had been selected, Warner said: &quot;Any organization daring enough to pick an unknown author would be a valuable asset to contemporary literature.&quot;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Dec+Mag+Sylvia+Townsend+Warner.jpg\" alt=\"sylvia\" />\nPhoto credit: Howard Coster, 1934/© National Portrait Gallery, London.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Warner went on to become a prolific writer. She wrote short stories for <em>The New Yorker</em> for decades, authored a travel guide and a biography of T.H. White, and edited a ten-volume on Tudor Church Music. She also co-authored a poetry collection with her life companion Valentine Ackland.</p>\n<p>Warner died in 1978. Although largely forgotten after her death, there has been a recent resurgence of interest in her work. <em>Lolly Willowes</em>, a debut novel about personal freedom, uneasy friendships, and magic, still reverberates almost one hundred years later.</p>\n<p>To this day, the Book of the Month Editorial Team strives to discover unorthodox themes, debut and emerging authors, and books that leave a lasting impression on readers.

What do you love most about that book?</strong></p>\n<p>Abbi Jacobson: I found it so relevant to where we are as a country today. I felt a lot while reading her stories and that’s what I’m looking for right now, to find content that makes me feel something.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Whatever Happened to Interracial Love</em> captures a very specific moment in time -- the 1960s in New York City. Your hit television show <em>Broad City</em> does the same in current day NYC. Reading this book, did you draw any parallels to your own work?</strong></p>\n<p>Definitely. I found her characters had such specific points of view and the situations she wrote about were serious and important, but also weirdly comical. I think New York can do that to any situation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/BOTM+Nov+Mag+AJ1Mag.jpg\" alt=\"abbi1\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Kathleen Collins maintains a distinctive voice throughout her story collection. How do you move through various projects (books and TV and comedy) and make sure your own voice remains distinctive throughout?</strong></p>\n<p>This is something I’ve been thinking a lot about lately. It’s more subconscious for me. If I think about maintaining a through line with my voice in various mediums it doesn’t happen as much. When I forget about my body of work-- and just create, I find my voice more clearly and can draw more parallels.</p>\n<p><strong>You recently published your own book, <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/546574/carry-this-book-by-abbi-jacobson/9780735221598/\"><em>Carry This Book</em></a>, your own sort of fan fiction. Has anyone ever sent you fan fiction? Any highlights?</strong></p>\n<p>Not really. It’s weird, in TV, you’re not really supposed to read any spec scripts of your own show, because if someone happens to come up with a similar joke and they see it on TV, they can sue you… So I tend to specifically NOT read fan fiction of <em>Broad City</em>. I know it’s out there, which is so flattering. It’s amazing to think of all the other storylines our characters might be living in other people’s minds.</p>\n<p><strong>In your book you pick up on many important pop culture references - like the post-it note left for Carrie in <em>Sex in the City</em> “I’m sorry I can’t don’t hate me.” Is there a modern day analogy to that post-it?</strong></p>\n<p>I suppose it would now be a text? Even though a post-it is such an absurd and cowardly way to break up with someone. Maybe a Snapchat? I don’t use Snapchat, but I imagine that would just be the worst way to be broken up with.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/BOTM+Nov+Mag+AJ2Mag.jpg\" alt=\"abbii2\" /></p>\n<p><strong>You’ve got an awesome squad - Lena Dunham, Ilana Glazer, Carrie Brownstein, Amy Poehler! They’ve all been by your side on your book tour. What’s it been like having this amazing support system?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s been so incredible. I pinch myself a lot thinking about the amount of brilliant women I’ve met and gotten to know over the past 5 years. I also had Sam Irby and Mike Perry as part of the tour—who were and are fantastic as well. I feel very lucky and inspired by my peers. The book tour was one of the best weeks I’ve had. I still haven’t been able to fully process it.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Broad City</em> is about the friendship between Abbi and Ilana. Our BOTM Judge <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/judges/CYNTHIA-D'APRIX-SWEENEY-28\">Cynthia D’Aprix Sweeney</a> writes of female friendship - “Friends are our first loves— the first time we get to say to another person, ‘I choose you.’ The first time we feel ourselves chosen. It's such a rush, that recognition, the thrill of a kindred spirit.” Is Abbi and Ilana’s friendship based on any of your own?</strong></p>\n<p>The friendship on the show is based on our friendship in real life. When Ilana and I met in 2007, it was an immediate friendship. We were on the same indie improve practice group and we all went to get a drink at a bar afterwards. I remember we sat at the bar and just talked the night away. I have a lot of amazing friends in my life that happen to be women, but Ilana was the first on in New York that really felt important. I guess we were right.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re open about your love for New York. What’s your ideal NYC weekend?</strong></p>\n<p>Fall in New York. Walking. Stopping for coffee. Walking. Reading in a park. Walking. Going in and out of stores, window shopping. Meeting friends for a bite. Walking. Popping into a café and writing a bit. Walking. Amazing dinner. Drinks… Walking.</p>\n<p><strong>Reading is incredibly important to Book of the Month members! How important is reading in your own life?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s very important. I go through waves of reading more or less. Depending on where we are in production of the show, I’m writing and reading a lot of drafts of scripts, so I tend to not read as much for leisure during those periods. When I’m not in that zone, I have a bunch of books going at a time. If I have an afternoon to go sit in a coffee shop and read, well there’s nothing better than that. What a luxury.</p>\n","cover_img":"BOTM+Nov+Mag+AJ3Mag.jpg","post_img":"BOTM+Nov+Mag+AJ3Mag.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Abbi Jacobson","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-12-01T11:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":""},{"id":178,"title":"<p>Season's Greetings!</p>\n","subtitle":"<p>Contest alert - have BOTM sponsor your NYE party!</p>\n","summary":"<p>We created our best BOTM holiday photo (see above) – and challenge you to do better!

I think that’s what we look for in all content really, stories and pieces of other people’s experiences that make us feel. Sad, sexy, hopeful and honest characters fill Kathleen Collin’s beautiful book.  And even though these stories were written decades ago, the issues and frustrations of her characters’ lives mimic where we are right now.  Strong, bold, black women fill the pages, reminiscing on an important time in American history, much of which still holds true today.</p>\n<p>Every story shifts tone and point of view in a way that keeps you on your toes as a reader—wondering not only what’s next for each character, but what might be in store for you as well.

It’s for anyone who’s yearning for something, looking to get lost in other’s journeys to find themselves, immerse themselves in other’s regrets for a moment.  I had never heard of Kathleen Collins before diving into her stories, and I later learned that this collection was discovered by her daughter many years after Kathleen’s death. Even so, her smart prose is specific and always changing, like she was constantly experimenting with who she was herself as a writer. I found her style immensely inspiring as a creator and as a woman.</p>\n","cover_img":"BOM_Mag_AbbiJacobson.gif","post_img":"BOM_Mag_AbbiJacobson.gif","author":"Abbi Jacobson","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-11-30T03:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":""},{"id":186,"title":"<p>We Want to Sponsor Your New Year's Party!</p>\n","subtitle":"<p>How to get BOTM to fund your fun</p>\n","summary":"<p>For more details and full set of rules, click <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/magazine/rules-189\">here</a></p>\n","cover_img":"BOTM-Holiday-11.7.16.jpg","post_img":"BOTM-Holiday-11.7.16.jpg","author":"Book of the Month","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-11-30T03:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p>We created our best BOTM holiday photo (see above) – and challenged you to do better!

All else is soup. And I’m a purist. I was taught to make clam chowder by a fantastic woman named Lydia, a professional cook and a notoriously hard drinker, from a Portuguese fishing family on Cape Cod. She was famous for her chowder—and her behavior. At the end of a shift, she’d often stagger through the kitchen doors, lurch out into the dining room, and deliver loud, horribly profane tirades directed straight at the owner, who’d be sitting there, paralytic with fear, in front of his guests. It is a testament to her chowder, I think, that he tolerated this. She’d use salt pork instead of bacon and drizzle a little clarified butter over the top at the end. Old school. They don’t make them like Lydia anymore.</p>\n<p>In a large, heavy-bottom saute pan with a lid, arrange the clams, 1 to 2 dozen at a time, into a single layer. Add about ½ cup water, cover, and bring to a boil to steam the clams open. Check them frequently. Using tongs, remove the opened clams to a sheet pan to cool, and add more clams until they have all been steamed open, discarding any that have not opened after a reasonable amount of time—there are usually one or two duds per 2 dozen clams. Once they’re cool enough to handle, remove them from their shells, reserving as much of the ambient cooking liquid (generally referred to as “liquor”) as possible, and place them in a small bowl or other container.</p>\n<p>In a heavy-bottom stockpot or Dutch oven, heat the salt pork over medium heat until it begins to render its fat, adding a tablespoon or two of water to keep it from browning, and stirring occasionally. When the fat has mostly been rendered, add the onions, stirring well to coat them with the fat. Season the onions lightly with salt and pepper and cook until they are translucent but not browned. Add the potatoes and just enough water to cover. Cook the mixture at a simmer until the potatoes are just tender.</p>\n<p>Whisk together the flour and a few tablespoons of the milk to make a smooth slurry, then add this mixture to the stockpot, stirring well. Add the clams and their liquor and simmer for about 5 minutes, until the clams are just warmed through. Just before serving, stir in the remaining milk and the cream and warm through, but do not boil. Taste the soup and season with salt and pepper as desired. Serve with the crackers alongside.</p>\n<p>Serves 6 to 8</p>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/BOTM+Nov+Mag+ClamChowder.Photocredit+Bobby+Fisher+Photography+(1).JPG\" alt=\"chowder\" />\n<em>Photo credit: Bobby Fisher Photography</em></p>\n<br>\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\n<p>8 dozen clams, preferably quahogs, scrubbed</p>\n<p>¼ pound salt pork or best-quality bacon, diced</p>\n<p>2 white or yellow onions, peeled and finely chopped</p>\n<p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>\n<p>3 Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced</p>\n<p>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p>\n<p>2 cups whole milk</p>\n<p>1 cup heavy cream</p>\n<p>Pilot crackers, for serving</p>\n","cover_img":"BOTM+Nov+Mag+Bourdain+(1).jpg","post_img":"BOTM+Nov+Mag+Bourdain+(1).jpg","author":"Anthony Bourdain","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-11-18T15:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p>From <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062409959/appetites/\"><i>Appetites</i></a>, page 51.</p>\n"},{"id":180,"title":"<p>#AskJudgeLiberty</p>\n","subtitle":"<p>Everyone’s favorite Judge opens up on Twitter</p>\n","summary":"<p>On November 15th, everyone’s favorite judge <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/judges/LIBERTY-HARDY-4\">Liberty Hardy</a> (she's selected <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/best-books-of-the-year\">8 of the top 10</a> most popular BOTM selections this year) took over <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bookofthemonth\">@bookofthemonth</a>’s feed to answer the Twitterverse’s most burning—and personal—questions.</p>\n<p>From morning till night, followers were able to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23askjudgeliberty&amp;src=typd\">#AskJudgeLiberty</a> anything while she hung out in the BOTM office, dispensing her usual brand of quirky, wise advice and revealing secrets and pro tips like where she buys her unique t-shirts, how she tackles a reading slump, and the book that was <em>so</em> good she wishes she wrote it.

I’ve worked with geniuses, scoundrels and scumbags, and have said it before, but it bears repeating: I’ve seen some shit.</p>\n<p>Though success is always nice to witness, and even nicer to achieve, I’m also fascinated and gratified by stories of big falls into gloriously wrenching failure and defeat. Such is the story of Bruno Alexander, the protagonist of Jonathan Lethem’s <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/a-gambler-s-anatomy-181\"><i>A Gambler’s Anatomy</i></a>.</p>\n<p>When we first encounter Bruno Alexander, he’s a handsome, vain, highly-intelligent hustler at the top of his game, which is backgammon. He’s won vast sums of cash by beating some of the world’s richest men, in casinos and gentlemen’s clubs and private drawing rooms where drinks are served by silent women in fetish gear. Bruno also happens to have telepathic powers, a stroke of literary magical thinking that Lethem uses to subtle, ultimately brilliant effect.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/BOM_Mag_AnthonyBourdain.gif\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n<p>But then, as Yeats and Achebe and countless others have observed, things fall apart. Bruno loses in Singapore; he loses in Berlin. He discovers a tumor behind his eyes. Broke and broken, he returns to Berkeley, California, his now-unrecognizable hometown, to undergo experimental neurosurgery requiring the removal and destruction of his attractive face in order to save his life. Footing the bill is Bruno’s boyhood friend Keith, a sniveling and jealous embodiment of schadenfreude who is only too happy to use his wealth in insidious ways. Having started his journey as a teenaged waiter at Chez Panisse, Bruno finds himself, many decades and thousands of miles later, flipping burgers back home and trying to rebuild his life.</p>\n<p>What becomes of a middle-aged man who appears to have lost it all?

The entire industry reacted—either with entertained amusement or with shocked anger. When the article became the book, rumors were flying about the controversial exposes and I was told repeatedly that Le Bernardin was mentioned several times. So I read the book—the first book I ever read in English—and was certainly surprised: Anthony only had compliments for Le Bernardin—we were one of the lucky few! The world he described, the unpolished-side of the kitchen filled with pirates and unsavory characters and their tattoos and taste for trouble, was eye-openingly different from the regimented, almost-militant kitchens of my own experience. I needed to know more…</p>\n<p>I decided to call Anthony and invite him to lunch; we got along very well and a friendship began. It wasn’t long before we’d spend evenings away from our restaurants in Anthony’s favorite subterranean dive bars, listening to obscure punk music on old jukeboxes. These places were definitely out of my element, but it was worth the venture to learn more about the industry underbelly that he spoke of in <i><a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/kitchen-confidential-183\">Kitchen Confidential</a></i> and gain a deeper insight into Anthony’s personality. He is a widely intelligent man whose knowledge spans such a vast range of topics—you see it often in his shows as he circles around the relationships between food and a region’s political, social, and cultural development. The dude is smart. He also is deeply caring and has an unparalleled work ethic. When we have plans, I can never be late. Never. Anthony is always on time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/ER1.jpg\" alt=\"image\" />\nI have tremendous respect Anthony. We are very different in our ways of thinking but have found an almost “Good &amp; Evil” balance in our relationship, even collaborating on a chocolate bar of that name. Whenever he invites me on his show, it doesn’t take long before we just ignore the cameras and have the same fun we always do. He still continues to find new ways to pull me out of my comfort zone, whether with alcohol indigenous to a town I’ve never heard of in a country I’ve never been, or noodles laced with spices so hot it takes me days to recover. Despite his time away traveling, despite our differences, despite being often mistaken for him on the street, it is a very genuine friendship that I am very grateful to have.</p>\n","cover_img":"ER2.jpg","post_img":"ER2.jpg","author":"Eric Ripert","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-10-31T08:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":""},{"id":173,"title":"<p>Fall, Flowers, and Felines: Member Photo Gallery</p>\n","subtitle":"<p>Some of the most beautiful snaps from our community</p>\n","summary":"<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Instagram_Nov_1.jpg\" alt=\"insta\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Instagram_Nov_2.jpg\" alt=\"insta2\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Instagram_Nov_3.jpg\" alt=\"insta3\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Instagram_Nov_4.jpg\" alt=\"insta4\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Instagram_Nov_5.jpg\" alt=\"insta5\" /></p>\n","cover_img":"BOM_Mag_TheMothers.jpg","post_img":"BOM_Mag_TheMothers.jpg","author":"Book of the Month","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-10-18T08:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p>For more fantastic member posts - check us out on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bookofthemonthclub/\">Instagram</a>.</p>\n"},{"id":172,"title":"<p>First Impressions - the October Selections</p>\n","subtitle":"<p>Get a feel for our new titles with a look at the first few lines</p>\n","summary":"<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/MothersFirstImp.jpg\" alt=\"a\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/WangsFirstImp.jpg\" alt=\"b\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/WonderFirstImp.jpg\" alt=\"c\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/FallGuyFirstImp-1.jpg\" alt=\"d\" /></p>\n","cover_img":"GoneFirstImp.jpg","post_img":"GoneFirstImp.jpg","author":"Book of the Month","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-10-07T08:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p>It's all about the first impression.

In <i><a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/the-wangs-vs-the-world-173\">The Wangs vs. The World</a></i>, the Wang family begins with excessive wealth that is abruptly lost, causing each family member to question the foundation of their identities and trace its roots back to the New Foreign place called China. Both stories are about identity but have different starting points. The Wangs get the opportunity to explore their essential selves: who we are when we have nothing? The Huangs get to build up and create their selves: who are we trying to become?</p>\n<p><strong>In <i><a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/the-wangs-vs-the-world-173\">The Wangs</a></i>, the Wang family starts off wealthy and abruptly loses all of their money.  What advice would the extremely frugal Jessica Huang have for a family that has only known excess?</strong></p>\n<p>I think Jessica would try to pare down the excess to essentials by selling off all the expensive stuff. Then, she’d put the profits in secure low-risk investments or into her children’s college education. She’s very practical and would put security for her children above all else.</p>\n<p><strong>Your own parents emigrated from Taiwan.  Recognizing that <i>The Wangs</i> is an outsized parody, were there any parts of the book that rang true to you?</strong></p>\n<p>The curiosity for my own Mainland Chinese ancestral roots felt familiar to me.</p>\n<p><strong>On <i>Fresh off the Boat</i>, Jessica is obsessed with <i>Melrose Place</i>. What television shows were you obsessed with growing up?</strong></p>\n<p>I was a very bookish kid, so I didn’t have any TV shows I obsessed over. But I remember a fondness for Mister Rogers. I also really liked PBS specials that had to do with theatre, dance, music.  I remember taping this Hammerstein special and watching it over and over again.  I love old musicals.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re a big supporter of other Asian-American celebrities.

(They’re not!)\n2: Assuming that Asian Americans characters are just “regular people” in a story unaffected by their ethnicity.</p>\n<p>Jade Chang’s funny, effusive, heartfelt novel <i><a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/the-wangs-vs-the-world-173\">The Wangs vs. the World</a></i> defies both traps. It’s not a story about Asians, but a story about Asian Americans: regular people claiming ownership of the Chinese roots that shaped their American identities.</p>\n<p>Charles Wang is a Chinese person from Taiwan who moved to America with big dreams and little direction.  His immodest spirit and a stroke of luck make him fabulously wealthy selling artificial pee to perfume manufacturers.  He buys a mansion in Bel-Air and raises two daughters and a son, all uniquely American kids (think college parties, quality weed, BMW convertibles, designer handbags, art openings and artisanal cheeses).  But no man’s spirit is strong enough to weather the force of an entire economy’s crash (think 2008) and Charles, out of nowhere, loses everything.</p>\n<p>Where do we go when we have nothing?  Home. It’s where we reclaim and revive our purest selves. And for Charles, home means two things: family and motherland.  So, since his family is scattered all over America, he embarks on a cross country road trip from Bel Air to New York’s Hudson Valley to collect his kids and to seek out their rights to his ancestor’s Chinese motherland.</p>\n<p>But the sudden poverty is unsettling for all.  Grace, the youngest Gen-Z daughter has to go from blogging about Couture Fashion to finding the beauty in a Whataburger sign.   For the son Andrew, a college student at Tulane, and true idealist, the loss of his innocence affects him more than the loss of his money as he falls into a passionate fling with a much older woman.  And the eldest daughter Saina’s riches spring from love. Her two love affairs are the art world and Grayson, her narcissistic manchild boyfriend.  She loses both, and hides away in the Catskills, awaiting her family’s arrival.</p>\n<p>For the father, this arrival is all to get the Wangs back to their Chinese homeland.  But like all good stories, it’s the journey not the destination.  The Wangs piece themselves together on the trip.  And as you read this book, I hope you find pieces of yourself as well.  I know I did.  This novel is filled with heart, history, and humor.  It is a worthy and exciting story.  I am very glad that it is being told and that it is being read.</p>\n","cover_img":"BOM_Mag_ConstanceWu.gif","post_img":"BOM_Mag_ConstanceWu.gif","author":"Constance Wu","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-09-29T08:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":""},{"id":168,"title":"<p>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</p>\n","subtitle":"<p>A special excerpt from Marie Kondo's beststeller</p>\n","summary":"<p>Imagine what it would be like to have a bookshelf filled only with books that you really love.

She also describes southern France in a way that is so right and so perfect: every time I read her words, I am transported back to the small town in Southern France where I first realized the import of my parents' story, as immigrants to the United States - which also connects directly to Gordimer's themes of identity and duty.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/judges/PATRIK-HENRY-BASS-10\">Judge Patrik Henry Bass</a>\n-- <strong>Beloved by Toni Morrison</strong></p>\n<p>It's my favorite novel &amp; a masterpiece of history, creativity, and emotion.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/SignificantBooks2.jpg\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jrpabs13/\">Jay</a> aka #sensitivejay -- <strong>Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison</strong></p>\n<p>&quot;A book I encountered for the first time in high school, and twice in college, and each time was astounded/expanded by Ellison's command of idiom and symbolism, his urgent mythmaking, his insights on race and violence.

Books Are <i>Durable</i>.</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve destroyed two eReaders in my lifetime. Each met an unfortunate end in the supposed safety of my carry-on. But I have never, ever managed to destroy a book. And I am positively brutal to my reading materials. I toss them in my bag, I bring them to the beach, I stain the pages with sunscreen and ice cream and occasionally, if the story is <i>really</i> good, with tears. And every time, the book survives, the cover proudly gleaming in the sunshine with an unspoken, “Is that all you got?”</p>\n<p><strong>2. You Can Match Your Book To Your Destination</strong></p>\n<p>In recent years, I’ve started coordinating my books with my travels. I’ve read Jane Austen while traveling through England, and devoured European spy novels while jaunting around Italy. And this summer, I’ve been home in Seattle, reading BOTM’s June selection, <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/about-selections/shrill-121\">Shrill</a>, by local author Lindy West. There’s something magical about making a book come alive by wandering through many of the same places mentioned in its pages, and seeing, with your very own eyes, what inspired an author. Don't worry if it's not a perfect match (it might be impossible to get to the Italian Riviera, but how about sitting in spot of sunshine in the park while Nutella straight from the jar? Instant Italian vacation!). Plus, if you ever want to relive a trip, you just need to crack open the pages one more time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/P1240920.JPG\" alt=\"shrill\" /></p>\n<p><strong>3. If Your Book Gets Lost or Stolen, You’ll Be Bummed, But Not Devastated</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most basic rules of travel is simple: leave your valuables at home. And guess what? Your tablet is a valuable. In my many years on the road, I’ve been scammed, ripped-off, and robbed. I’ve learned not to pack anything that I’m scared to lose. And while I love my books (and have been known to literally hug a particularly compelling tome more than once), they are, for the most part, replaceable. I’m not scared to leave them in a hotel room or on my airline seat – I know they’ll be there when I return.</p>\n<p><strong>4. You Can Read and Still Enjoy Your Environment</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong: I love zoning out in front of the TV as much as the next person. I’ve spent many grey afternoons binge-watching shows about zombie detectives and teenage detectives and if someone makes a show about zombie teenage detectives <i>I am so watching it</i>. But TV can be a sort of all-encompassing onslaught on the senses that drowns out everything else – which isn’t exactly what you want if you’re on vacation. Books allow you to connect with your surroundings in a way that screentime doesn’t – you can still hear the crashing of waves and the chirping of birds and the sounds of the world around you. You can take a minute to breathe in fresh air – stress-free, sweet-smelling, <i>vacation</i> air. And then you crack into the next chapter because you can’t wait to know what happens next.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/P1240925.JPG\" alt=\"read\" /></p>\n<p><strong>5. You Can Share it With Your Fellow Travelers</strong></p>\n<p>Odds are, you’re traveling with someone because you want to connect with them – and books are a great way to do that. Whenever my husband and I leave for a trip (we’re both on the road a lot for work – fortunately, we often get to travel together), we each usually try to a grab a new book – one that neither of us has read. And when we’ve finished, we trade. And because we’re super, duper nerdy (in the best possible way) we then talk about what we’ve read – our own little book club, usually held at 36,000 feet. And if we don’t have room in our suitcase for all those books we’ve accumulated while on the road? We just pass them on to another traveler – the reactions are usually incredibly, effusively grateful (because, seriously, who doesn’t like a free book?)</p>\n<p><strong>6. Even a Suspenseful Book Is More Relaxing Than a Suspenseful TV Show</strong></p>\n<p>Okay, here’s the thing: I love thrillers, and mysteries, and suspenseful stories. But I cannot handle watching them on TV, because between the creepy music and the intense camera angles, I freak out in a way that doesn’t really say “relaxation.” But a peaceful vacation can be a perfect counterpoint to a suspenseful book. I just finished <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/about-selections/the-woman-in-cabin-10-138\">The Woman In Cabin 10</a> – one of BOTM’s August selections. It’s a fast-paced and blood-pressure-spiking thriller (the entire book takes place on a boat – a claustrophobia-inducing setting and a main character who is a travel writer with anxiety. Let’s just say I can relate.) I know for a fact I could not have handled watching something that intense on a screen – but reading it was a totally different experience. I read this page-turner while sitting back and relaxing in the summer sun.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/P1240918.JPG\" alt=\"woman\" /></p>\n<p><strong>7. You Will Literally Sleep Better If You Read a Book</strong></p>\n<p>The National Sleep Foundation notes that <a href=\"https://sleepfoundation.org/ask-the-expert/electronics-the-bedroom/page/0/1\">even small electronic devices (like your tablet) promote wakefulness</a> (and yes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/23/ebooks-affect-sleep-alertness-harvard-study\">eReaders</a> do it, too). Our brains interpret the light as a sign that it’s daytime – so we’re more likely to have trouble sleeping. But scientists have found that reading an actual physical book before going to bed doesn’t have the same negative effect – books <a href=\"http://hellogiggles.com/help-you-sleep-better/\">can actually help you sleep better</a>.

This evolved into a love and passion for archaeology and anthropology, both of which I studied in college (though I majored in English). I grew up going to a ranch in Montana each summer, so I have also always adored horses. My relationship to that little girl is one of the things I hold most dear to me in my adult life. However, I don’t want to misrepresent myself – my childhood contained a fraction of the fantastic and otherworldly adventures that Beryl’s did.</p>\n<p><strong>You were an English major at Yale and have been very vocal about your love of reading.

What would she say is her favorite book?</strong></p>\n<p>Her answer to that would probably change with each boyfriend. Her first answer, when she was dating Charlie, would probably have been <i>The Andy Warhol Diaries</i>, since she wanted to be in the art world. Then, when she was with Booth Jonathan, her answer would have been <i>What is the What</i> by Dave Eggers. When she was with Ray, she would have said <i>The Shining</i> by Stephen King, because…why not. And when she was with Desi, she would have said her favorite book was <i>Just Kids</i> by Patti Smith. Now that she’s on her own, I would bet her favorite book is also one of mine: <i>Frankenstein</i> by Mary Shelley.

I was initially intrigued by the fact that it is set in Kenya, as that is one of only five countries in Africa to which I’ve traveled. I knew little else when I started reading, but found that I relished every single page. It became the anthem to my summer -- my reason to anticipate bedtime with excitement and curiosity, when I could have my nightly check-in with this fascinating protagonist who alternately frustrated and inspired me.  This is the amazing story of real woman’s life (please don’t look her up online – it might spoil the story of her wonderfully unpredictable journey!)</p>\n<p>In 1904, a three year-old named Beryl moves from England to Kenya (before it was ”Kenya”) with her mother, father and brother. Two years later, her mother and older brother return to England (for reasons I am reluctant to reveal – no spoilers!), leaving Beryl in Kenya to be raised by her father, who trains horses and runs a farm.  Growing up adjacent to and immersed in several families from the Kipsigis tribe, Beryl becomes an aspiring young warrior (having never absorbed Western expectations of girlhood), passionate racehorse trainer, and adventurer. We first meet her, in a flash-forward prologue, while she’s performing her ultimate occupation: pilot.</p>\n<p>Beryl’s aviation prowess -- she makes history by becoming the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic from east to west -- seems nearly impossible to imagine as the story of her early life begins. By giving us a glimpse into her future, the author sets us up for an amazing journey as I found myself asking: <i>How on Earth is this where Beryl ends up? </i> McLain challenges us with the ending that we know is coming, and she thwarts every effort to make sense of it all before it’s time.</p>\n<p>It helps that this book is beautifully written. As an English major, I am a stickler for grammar, syntax, structure, and language. I found myself highlighting many of her stunning phrases. An example:</p>\n<p><i> “While a leopard moth that had got caught in the curtains stopped struggling for a moment, and realized it was free.” </i></p>\n<p>Grammatically, this sentence is…problematic. However, I was repeatedly struck by the beauty and profundity of McLain’s imagery. It is likely that the language is <i>deliberately</i> rough, for the “world” of the novel is a rough one with moments of sheer beauty. This description also applies to the protagonist.</p>\n<p>Beryl is, after all, wonderfully unpolished and irreverent. She is brave and naïve – a combination that proves both disastrous and fortuitous as she moves through her life. My favorite moments are those in which McLain draws comparisons between Beryl and both wild animals and Africa itself:</p>\n<p><i> “[a lion] can only be exactly what he is, what his nature dictates, and nothing else.” </i></p>\n<p><i> “…that was something I loved about Africa. The way it got at you from outside in and never let up, and never let you go.” </i></p>\n<p>Beryl is torn between two worlds –an English girl born at the turn of the twentieth century, she is also naturally and thoroughly wild. It is unknown to us or others whether her wildness is nature or nurture, but I’m inclined to say that it is both. The inevitability of her (and everyone else’s) path is the central drive of the novel.</p>\n<p><i> “It was possible everyone ended up in the same place no matter which path we took or how often we fell to our knees, undoubtedly wiser for all of it.”</i></p>\n<p>Read this book for an emotional vacation to a fascinating moment in world history. Read it to be astounded by the human spirit’s ability to conquer so much. Read it to be inspired by bravery in the face of true mortal danger. Read it for the romance! Read it because it happened. Enjoy it because it’s excellent.</p>\n","cover_img":"BOM_Mag_AllisonWilliams+(1).gif","post_img":"BOM_Mag_AllisonWilliams+(1).gif","author":"Allison Williams","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-07-31T08:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":""},{"id":148,"title":"<p>Keep Your Cool with the BOTM Koozie</p>\n","subtitle":"<p>Post your koozie and book for a chance to win!</p>\n","summary":"<p>Dear Readers,</p>\n<p>There's nothing like relaxing with a good book and a glass of white wine or rosé.

How's life these days?</strong></p>\n<p>Hi Liberty! Life is… Life is exciting, and terrifying, and great. The response to <i><a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/more-books/sleeping-giants-131\">Sleeping Giants</a></i> is better than anything I could have dreamed of. I’m a debut author. Everything is new, everything.</p>\n<p><strong>Where did the idea for <i>Sleeping Giants</i> come from?</strong></p>\n<p>You can blame my son for this one. I asked him – he must have been two or three at the time – if he’d like me to build him a toy robot. Simple, right? “Yes, dad!” is the proper answer to that question. But no, not my son. He wanted to know everything about the toy before I built it. What does it do? Where is it from? Does it fly? I didn’t have the backstory he wanted so I put the whole thing on hold. A few days later, we were watching Japanese anime about – you guessed it – a giant robot from outer space, and I asked myself what it would be like, in real life, if we found giant artifacts from an unknown civilization. I started writing that night. In some ways, <i>Sleeping Giants</i> is really about a father building a toy for his son.</p>\n<p><strong>How much did the book change from your original idea, if at all?</strong></p>\n<p>Not much. I wrote the prologue first, but I plotted the whole book before I went any further. I’m sure I changed a few things along the way, but most of what I had is still there. I’m a plotter.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you plot the story out for three books, or are you building it book-by-book?</strong></p>\n<p>I had the plot for book two about halfway through writing book one. Book three was one sentence, but I knew where it was heading. Everyone assumes it’s a trilogy but I started this as an open series. We’ll see where it goes, but I love that universe. Right now, I can’t imagine getting tired of playing in it.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the idea of telling the story through interviews and reports?</strong></p>\n<p>Besides the fact that it fit the story really well, I always liked epistolary novels. It forces you to participate. As a reader, I really enjoy authors who put me to work, who trust me enough to let me figure things out on my own. Dialogue will do that. You’re not in anyone’s head, so you have to discover the characters like you would a real person, not so much through what they say, but how they say it, what they won’t say, their enthusiasm or their hesitation.</p>\n<p><strong>What limits/freedoms do you think you have as a writer when you structure a book in that way?</strong></p>\n<p>It takes forever to structure these books. The characters are in charge, and the point of view I choose for a particular scene is often as important as what’s happening. I can present things as they occur, or after the fact. Sometimes the best thing is to not present them at all and let the reader infer what happened from the consequences. There are some limitations in what you can do with action scenes, for example, but a lot more freedom elsewhere. You can choose from a multitude of perspectives, play with time. Oh, and you don’t have to tell the truth.</p>\n<p><strong>Who is your favorite character to write?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s a tough one. Kara and Rose are fun. Kara a little more so because I don’t have to read science papers every time she opens her mouth. My inner Kara is pretty close to the surface too. She comes out easily. The interviewer is the one I feel closest to. He’s\nalways there. Whether I try to “be” Rose, or put myself in Mr. Burn’s skin, I always have to be the interviewer.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you decided on the nameless interrogator's identity yet, or is that still a surprise even to you?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh, I know. :)</p>\n<p><strong>Your biography mentions you've had several different jobs - did you always write, as well?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, many of the countless jobs I had involved writing. I was a journalist; I wrote training courses. I co-wrote a screenplay that was optioned when I was much younger, published some questionable poetry. I’m also reasonably well published as a linguist. But I always wrote for the pleasure of it. First book I ever wrote was for a public of one. I walked into the wrong bathroom in Venezuela and I met someone. She had a boyfriend. I mailed her a book chapter by chapter.</p>\n<p><strong>Your biography also mentions you'd like to be an astronaut. What attracts you to space exploration?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, it’s there, for one thing. To not go would be like spending a week in Paris without leaving your hotel room. I’ve been staring at the sky ever since I can remember, not so much wondering if there’s anyone out there, but just in awe at the size of everything.</p>\n<p>There’s enough space between Earth and the moon to fit every other planet in the solar system with room to spare. We get email alerts whenever the International Space Station flies over. I love the fact that little kids all over the world can see it go by. It’s the\nbrightest spot in the sky after the sun and moon, and we made it. That’s inspiring. When I was about twenty years old, I made a bucket list. There were three things on it: Get a degree (I was a high-school drop-out), have children, go to space. I got a Ph.D., my son says he wants to be a writer. I’m two out of three.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you believe in extraterrestrial life?</strong></p>\n<p>The interviewer asked Kara that same question. She said no. Me, I guess it depends on how you word the question. Is there life out there? Yes. Certainly. But it could be microbes, green goo. Is there something intelligent enough for us to call it sentient? Probably. Something that thinks in a way we can comprehend, in a shape somewhat similar to ours? The odds get lower and lower the closer you get to movie aliens. Do I want there to be? Hell yeah!</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us anything about the second book, <i>Waking Gods</i>, coming in April 2017?</strong></p>\n<p>I know people have questions after <i>Sleeping Giants</i>. There are some answers in <i>Waking Gods</i>, hopefully some interesting new questions as well. It takes place nine years after the last one. It’s darker, faster. The stakes are much higher in this one, for the characters, and for all of us. I think people will be surprised.</p>\n<p><strong>Could you possibly have the coolest job in the world?</strong></p>\n<p>Let me think... I write about giant robots for a living. Yeah, I win. Runners-up: the guy who designs little toys to put in Kinder eggs, National Geographic photographer.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks, Sylvain!</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you, Liberty!</p>\n","cover_img":"SleepingGiantsAuthor.jpg","post_img":"SleepingGiantsAuthor.jpg","author":"Liberty Hardy, Sylvain Neuvel","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-07-15T08:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p>Judge Liberty Hardy's July selection is a debut sci-fi novel that's being compared to <i>The Martian</i>.

In <i><a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/other-favorites\">The Sleep Revolution</a></i> you offer recommendations and tips from experts on how to achieve better sleep. How important is reading, particularly physical books, in this effort?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s so important, in no small part because blue light, the sort given off by our ubiquitous electronic devices, is especially good at suppressing melatonin— which makes it especially bad for our sleep. In fact, a 2015 survey showed that 71 percent of Americans sleep with or next to their smartphones.</p>\n<p>It’s why reading real, physical books – especially poetry, novels and books that have nothing to do with work -- is central to my nightly transition to sleep, which I treat as a sacrosanct ritual. First, I turn off all my electronic devices and gently escort them out of my bedroom. Then, I take a hot bath with epsom salts and a candle flickering nearby—a bath that I prolong if I’m feeling anxious or worried about something. I don’t sleep in my workout clothes as I used to (think of the mixed message that sends to our brains) but have pajamas, nightdresses, even T-shirts dedicated to sleep. Sometimes I have a cup of chamomile or lavender tea if I want something warm and comforting before going to bed. Then, bring on the books!</p>\n<p><strong>2. Have you ever stayed up all night to finish a great book? Which one(s)?</strong></p>\n<p>Not since I reformed my sleep habits. I’m too keenly aware of the cost of pulling an all-nighter for any reason – even if it’s a relatively good reason like a great book.</p>\n<p>My daughters often laugh as they remember me reading books to them to put them to sleep— through the years graduating from <i>Dr. Seuss</i> to <i>Harry Potter</i>— and falling asleep in mid-sentence (“One fish, two fish, red fish . . . zzzzzzzz”). As my younger daughter, Isabella, recounts, “My mom would begin to slur her words, and I would have to shake her and repeat over and over again, ‘Wake up, Mom, wake up, Mom! Finish the story!’ ” (At least the stories worked on one of us.)</p>\n<p><strong>3. Ellie Kemper, Book of the Month's Guest Judge for April, told us she believes we are experiencing &quot;the age of the Nerd.&quot; Do you agree? Do you consider yourself a nerd?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes! I think people today, and especially young people, are more comfortable sharing and embracing passions and interests that aren’t traditionally cool -- whether science, technology, coding, reading, etc. At the same time, the rise of social media has made it infinitely easier for people to connect and form communities around these shared passions. As for me, I’m constantly starting conversations about all the new scientific findings around sleep – since new ones seem to emerge every week – so I’m pretty sure I qualify as a bona fide nerd!</p>\n<p><strong>4. As an author, and the Co-Founder and Editor-in-Chief of <i>The Huffington Post</i>, you hold a large amount of influence over what media consumers read. What are your thoughts on the importance of reading fiction vs non-fiction?</strong></p>\n<p>I personally love both fiction and non-fiction, and at <i>The Huffington Post</i> we cover and champion both, not only in our Books section but in various other ways, including book excerpts published on our platform.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Recently you’ve become great friends with the Snapchat king himself, DJ Khaled, and even went to his wife's baby shower! What do you think it is about him that draws so many people to follow him?</strong></p>\n<p>So many factors contribute to the marvel that is DJ Khaled: humor, openness, a spirit of experimentation, and a gift for phrasemaking, from #blessup to his major keys to success. But beyond all that there’s something relentlessly optimistic, positive and generous about him, and that’s why his messages resonate on such a huge scale.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Have you ever read <i>Art of the Deal</i>? What's your take on Trump's literary skills? And what advice would you give him to improve his Twitter skills?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve read passages, but Trump’s literary and social media skills are the least of his problems. He’s the most unqualified, unstable and dangerous nominee in U.S. history. And tweeting in the middle of the night, as he often does, is just another manifestation of his dreadful sleep habits. He brags that he only sleeps three or four hours a night and displays all the symptoms of chronic sleep deprivation: lack of judgment, inability to process basic information, inchoate outbursts of anger, lack of impulse control, trouble listening to others, irritability, mood swings, a paranoid tendency to spout conspiracy theories, and false memories.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Which US president is/was, in your opinion, the best communicator?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s a toss-up between Lincoln and FDR. But let me pick FDR, who was not only a great communicator but also knew the value of sleep as it relates to leadership. One of my favorite stories is how, in 1940, to think through the monumental question of whether America should enter the war, he announced that he would be taking a ten-day vacation, sailing around the Caribbean on a navy ship – something that would be inconceivable in today’s political climate. A letter from his wife, Eleanor, read, “I think of you sleeping and eating and I hope getting rest from the world.” As Roosevelt’s aide Harry Hopkins later said, “I began to get the idea that he was refueling, the way he so often does when he seems to be resting and carefree.” The result of Roosevelt’s refueling was the $50 billion Lend- Lease program, in which the United States would lend arms and supplies to Great Britain and be paid back after the war in kind. As Roosevelt’s speechwriter Robert Sherwood put it, “One can only say that FDR, a creative artist in politics, had put in his time on this cruise evolving the pattern of a masterpiece.”</p>\n<p><strong>8. Which would you rather do: sleep only 3 hours each night for the next year, or read a book by Ann Coulter?</strong></p>\n<p>Ann Coulter, by far! That might sound masochistic on the surface, but the effects of long-term sleep deprivation are far more harmful than temporary exposure to her peculiar brand of literature.</p>\n<p><strong>9. In 2001 you wrote a book called <i>How to Overthrow the Government</i>.  Given what we’ve seen with Bernie and Donald, is this what you had in mind?</strong></p>\n<p>What I explored in that book were many of the legitimate grievances people had at the time and continue to have today, as a result of a government that has not adequately addressed our country’s crisis of growing inequalities. Bernie Sanders has given voice to that discontent. Trump, of course, has peddled racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and lies.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Why are books by politicians typically so boring?  Can you think of any that weren’t truly terrible, either by Democrats or Republicans?</strong></p>\n<p>Books by politicians are so often boring because they’re simply extensions of political campaigns -- strategic, inauthentic posturing designed to win votes or fashion a legacy, not connect meaningfully with readers.</p>\n<p>But one of my favorite books was written by a politician, though not of our time. In the 1840s, Benjamin Disraeli, still a long way from being prime minister, wanted to wake people up to the plight of the British working class – and move them to act. The alarm he sounded wasn't delivered in a speech, a pamphlet, or an article -- but in a novel, Sybil, published in 1845. It had the desired effect -- raising awareness, provoking outrage, and leading to the passage of several fundamental social reforms. Disraeli knew that one of the most effective ways to touch people is through narrative -- putting flesh and blood on raw facts and data.</p>\n","cover_img":"BOM_Mag_AriannaHuffington.gif","post_img":"BOM_Mag_AriannaHuffington.gif","author":"Book of the Month, Arianna Huffington","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-07-01T13:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>We caught up with July Guest Judge Arianna Huffington - cofounder, president, and editor in chief of the Huffington Post Media Group, and author of <i><a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/other-favorites\">'The Sleep Revolution'</a></i> - to talk good books, bad politics, and more.</i></p>\n"},{"id":135,"title":"<p>Arianna Huffington on Unconditional Love</p>\n","subtitle":"<p>Why our July Guest Judge Selected ‘Love That Boy’</p>\n","summary":"<p>For me, there are few subjects as precious as unconditional love.  All my life, my mother gave me a sense of unconditional loving. This meant that even as I was going for my dreams, I knew that if I failed she wouldn’t love me any less. And that made me less afraid to fail.</p>\n<p>As a mother, I loved Ron Fournier’s <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/more-books/LoveThatBoy%20-%20127\">'Love That Boy,'</a> and while it’s a book about parenting, its lessons are universal. At its core, this book is an honest, moving mediation on the meaning of unconditional love – about the expectations we bring to the relationships in our lives, and how we square those expectations with the real, flesh-and-blood human beings who mean the most to us and challenge us.</p>\n<p>Fournier, a father of three, is a seasoned political journalist, with decades spent covering or overseeing coverage of national politics. As he admits, it’s “an ego-inflating career that I often put ahead of my wife and kids.” His wakeup call comes when his son, Tyler, is diagnosed with Asperger’s at age 12. The boy is socially awkward and -- to Fournier’s deep disappointment and frustration -- doesn't share his father’s love of sports. With the diagnosis, Fournier at last begins to confront a hard, essential truth. “When a parent’s expectations come from the wrong place and are pressed into service of the wrong goals, kids get hurt,” he writes. “I discovered this late in my job as a father.”</p>\n<p>For Fournier, the breakthrough comes when he and Tyler discover a shared passion for presidential history. At his wife’s urging, father and son set out on a series of road trips -- bonding tours, really -- visiting presidential sites across the country.</p>\n<p>But what I find truly refreshing, and what I’m most grateful for, is that this book transcends the political divisions of our time: love, expectations, disappointment, and longing, it turns out, are beyond left-and-right. Fournier and Tyler meet with Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. On Fournier’s last day covering the White House for the Associated Press, he introduces Tyler, not yet diagnosed, to President Bush. The meeting is as awkward as Fournier can imagine. As he’s leaving, though, President Bush gives him a piece of advice he’ll remember for the rest of his life: “love that boy.”</p>\n","cover_img":"ArianaUpdated.jpg","post_img":"ArianaUpdated.jpg","author":"Arianna Huffington","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-07-01T10:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":""},{"id":137,"title":"<p>Go Crazy with BOTM!</p>\n","subtitle":"<p>Show us your best crazy (straw) photos for a chance to win</p>\n","summary":"<p>Dear Readers,</p>\n<p>Time to get crazy!

One, I come out of the old Associated Press wire service tradition, proudly. So I’m used to writing 500 to 800 word stories and then moving on, and I’m almost always a dispassionate observer.</p>\n<p>Even if I have an opinion on what I’m covering I like to think I’m very good about retaining my objectivity; even as a calmness when I form my opinions. So I’m always a step removed from whatever I’m writing about, especially having a career in politics, which is not an area that personally, to be honest with you, I have a lot of interest in. I’m not a political junkie. I didn’t get into journalism to cover politics so it’s always been a dispassionate exercise.</p>\n<p>So here, to do this book, first of all it had to be a lot longer than 800 words and so telling a story and maintaining a story - book length - was way outside my comfort zone. A bigger challenge was, as you suggested, me writing about myself and my family. Although the book has just as much content about other parents as my wife and I, and I bring in a lot of other voices from the child development community, a good portion of the book is my story and my son’s story and it was awfully hard and took a lot of effort and a lot of trial and error to get myself to think honestly about my actions and then to write honestly about my actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Was your son involved in the decision to write this book or was he too young at that point?</strong></p>\n<p>No, he was old enough to be aware. He was 12 years old when he was diagnosed and he was 13 when I wrote the essay on him and he was 18 when the book was published, so he was involved to a great extent. He read every word that I wrote and had the ability to veto every word in both of the projects - both the magazine piece and then the book.</p>\n<p>He wasn’t as involved as his mother who literally is the person who is responsible for this whole project. She was the one who said, “Get out on the road with him; spend some time with him.” She is the one who said, “Write a magazine article so he’ll have something that he’ll always know how much we loved him, even after we’re gone.” And then she’s the one who said, “Turn this into a book so he’s got something really big and special that he can hang onto, even after we’re gone.”</p>\n<p><strong>I thought some of the best anecdotes were when Tyler met the Presidents - Clinton, George W and Obama - have you gotten any feedback from them after writing the book?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve gotten some. President Bush just a couple of weeks ago sent a nice note through a staff member congratulating me on the book. Hillary Clinton, who hadn’t read it yet sent me a nice note about autism, which is a big concern of hers, and congratulated me on publishing the book even though I don’t think she’s had time to read it. I haven’t heard anything directly or indirectly from President Clinton, but I have no reason to think that he’s got a problem with it because I thought he was very gracious towards Tyler and so I tried to show that graciousness in the book.</p>\n<p>And it was a really quick meeting with President Obama. It was basically a quick moment as we were getting a photo taken with him, along with 500 other people at a Christmas party, so I don’t expect to hear from President Obama. But even in that brief exchange, when you read the book you’ll see how kind President Obama and Michelle Obama were towards Tyler.</p>\n<p>It’s one thing I came away with the book; it was just reminding myself that whether it’s a Republican or a Democrat, whether it’s a Clinton or a Bush or any of their fellow politicians, remember that these are people and they’re not just titles. They’re not just politicians; that they are people who get into the business for the right reason and they had no reason to - Bush and Clinton in particular - to meet with Tyler. They just did it because it’s the kind of thing they’ve been doing in public service their whole lives and that’s a good thing to remember, even for someone like me who professionally has to be a cynic or at least a skeptic. Skeptic is a better word.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Guest Judge Arianna Huffington wrote of your book - quote - “But what I find is really refreshing and what I’m most grateful for is that this is a book that transcends the political divisions of our time. Love, expectations, disappointment and longing it turns out are beyond left and right.”</strong></p>\n<p>It was something I’ve always tried to remind myself of. I remember how I went from covering Clinton as a governor in Arkansas and seeing him every day and how my view and even the way I wrote about him changed once he became president and he became more removed from me and less of - I wasn’t reminded every day that I was dealing with a person. He wasn’t looking at me in the eyes every day and asking me what the heck I was working at.</p>\n<p>I remember telling myself then: Don’t lose the humanity in what you’re writing. Be skeptical, be tough with no fear or favor, but remember that you’re covering peoples’ lives. You tend to forget that, especially now, I’m a columnist at a time when our politics are falling apart and it’s gotten very mean and dysfunctional and short sighted.</p>\n<p>So it’s easy for me to be a part of that toxicity rather than looking for bright spots and holding up what’s good about politics as an example that we can build on. This book, this project reminded me again that it isn’t all bad in politics; it’s much more worse than it should be and it’s much worse than it needs to be for us to be a successful country, but not everybody is depraved.</p>\n<p>So I’m glad that she said that. I’ve been very pleased by how this book has connected with people on so many levels that I wasn’t expecting, and one of them is all the Democrats have come up to me and said, “I didn’t realize what a nice guy George Bush was.” I like the fact that people are looking at Bush differently.</p>\n<p>And the reverse is true; I didn’t realize that Republicans were coming out and saying, “I didn’t realize what a decent man Bill Clinton could be.” Well, I think it’s good that, even though I didn’t do it on purpose, that I am giving people a different view of the men and women who represent that.</p>\n<p><strong>You and your wife spent a lot of time to find a learning environment that would suit Tyler, which presidential candidate do you think would be the best advocate for education for those children with special needs?</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it’s an easy question to answer. I wish I could tell you that there were two competing plans out there and it kind of depended on what side of the aisle you’re on and what color jersey you’re wearing, red or blue, for you to decide who would do the best for autism. But the truth of the matter is there is only one candidate who has put forward an autism plan, and it’s a very comprehensive one that looks at both the concerns of the community who have very low functioning autistic children and the concerns of autistic adults who are on the higher end of the spectrum who want more support and less money spent on research, and that’s Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>She’s the only one who’s bothered, her and her staff, to do the homework that’s necessary to understand this issue and put forward a comprehensive plan. The only thing I’ve ever heard Donald Trump says about autism is spreading the false and dangerous rumor that autism is linked to vaccination. So unfortunately, if you’re voting on autism there is only one candidate to look at because one candidate has a plan and the other candidate has promoted a lie. I hope that changes. I hope Donald Trump puts forward a plan on it but he hasn’t yet.</p>\n<p><strong>So you also introduced broader themes of fatherhood - how do you think Trump stacks up as a father, separate from these issues?</strong></p>\n<p>How does Trump stack up as a father? Well, it’s hard to tell from the outside. I’ve had a lot of people ask me that about Bill Clinton too, who I covered from when Chelsea Clinton was a little girl, and President Bush - when he was in office I watched his girls grow from teenagers to young women. From everything I can tell, and Obama for that matter - Obama, Bush and Clinton and Trump - from everything I can tell, which isn’t much from the outside, they seem to be good parents and the only thing you have to judge by it is their children.</p>\n<p>I have no reason to believe that Trump’s children aren’t caring, loving, devoted people, and if that’s the case he deserves some credit for that, him and their mother. That’s a very superficial judge; I’m barely equipped to give you an opinion on them politically, let alone what kind parents they are. I don’t cover the families.</p>\n<p><strong>Fair enough.</strong></p>\n<p>From all accounts it seems like his kids have turned out fairly well.</p>\n<p><strong>So how are your children doing? How is Tyler doing now?</strong></p>\n<p>Tyler is doing much better than his father deserves. He’s a remarkable young man now. He’s 18 years old. He graduates in a couple of weeks from high school, so by the time this comes out he will have been graduated for a couple of weeks. He graduates in June of 2016. Next year he will be entering the workforce, probably part-time, and entering college probably part-time, and we’ll seek to get him a little bit of independence, maybe what they call home within a home where he’ll still be living with us but he’ll start paying bills and being responsible for groceries and laundry and that kind of thing to kind of wean him off of us.</p>\n<p>We really think he’s going to be living independently over time and have a good job and, as is pointed out in the book, <i>his</i> version of happy; maybe not what I always thought would be happy but <i>his</i> version of happiness. He’s learning to drive now, which is something a couple of years ago I would have thought might not be possible but it turns out he’s a very good driver. I think he might be a better driver than his sisters were at their age.</p>\n<p><strong>That’s great to hear.</strong></p>\n<p>He’s doing good. The project has been good for him and for the whole family. It’s made us all, not just more self aware, but more willing to talk about things that fathers don’t like to talk about; basically, how good of a job are they doing or how bad of a job are they doing. Since I’ve put that mess on the table now we’re able to talk about it honestly. When I’m doing something that isn’t quite right Tyler and his mom - there’s a dialogue there. It’s very easy for them to say, “You wrote this, why are you doing that?”</p>\n<p><strong>I want to ask you about Arianna’s book, <i>The Sleep Revolution</i>. You both have very stressful jobs that require around the clock attention to media and what’s going on in the world. I’m sure you’ve seen her talking about the book or read some of it? Do you get eight hours sleep at night and do you kind of have any thoughts on what she’s preaching there?</strong></p>\n<p>I do and I’ve read it. I think it’s a great book. I get about seven hours of sleep a night. When I was younger I rarely got that much. This 24/7 cycle that she writes about and that we talk about, isn’t really new to me. I broke into the business in the wire service in the mid ’80s - which was a 24/7 job in the ’80s, even before the internet - so I’ve always been the kind of person whose pager - when it was pagers and then BlackBerrys and iPhones - had always been on. I’ve been called out of bed for all kinds of stories and worked all kinds of weird hours.</p>\n<p>And for a long time, like when I was covering the Clinton and Bush White Houses, I had myself convinced that I actually wrote better when I was real tired because it slowed down my mind and just forced me to concentrate on what I was writing. It took me a while to realize that I was kind of fooling myself that, okay, it might have made me a better writer but it certainly made me a lot more impatient and a lot more forgetful and a lot less of a quality human being the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>So as I’ve gotten older and have less stamina, but also just more self awareness, I now try really hard to get my sleep. I find I can function really good on seven hours sleep and so that’s what I get. I’ll catch up occasionally and it’s not unusual for me to take a power nap during the day.</p>\n<p><strong>How does it feel that your book was selected by Arianna as her Book of the Month?</strong></p>\n<p>Are you kidding me? This is an incredible honor. It’s a huge institution, the Book of the Month Club, and then to be selected by Arianna Huffington, who is a big leader in my industry and one of the thought leaders of our country. For her to pick up my book out of all the other books that are out there, is quite an honor. Like I said, I’ve just been blown away by how this book has been received and this is just another example of how lucky I got in getting the book in pretty good shape.</p>\n<p>What really satisfies me about her response to it is that sees how universal the book is. That it’s not just about parents with special needs and it’s not just about autism; it’s about the expectations that all of us parents have for our kids and how they come out of a place of love, but if we’re not careful it can really misshape our kids. I just get a kick out of the fact that she saw it as broadly as that.</p>\n","cover_img":"RonFornier.jpg","post_img":"RonFornier.jpg","author":"Ron Fournier, Book of the Month","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p>July Guest Judge Arianna Huffington selected Ron Fournier's memoir, <i>Love That Boy</i>, about his relationship with his autistic teenage son.

In this case it was a story I heard about a wealthy family whose two year old daughter was kidnapped. She survived and was recovered, only to be killed in a small plane crash years later. My mind struggled to attach meaning to the facts. What was the point of surviving one tragedy, only to be killed a short time later by another. This was the starting point for me, and <i>Before the Fall</i>, while not a direct adaptation of that story, was informed by it.</p>\n<p><strong>How much did the book change from your original idea, if at all? Did you toy with different endings with regards to what happened to the plane?</strong></p>\n<p>Mysteries demand solutions, but what made this book challenging was that Scott Burroughs, our hero, wasn’t tasked with solving the principal mystery of why his plane crashed. That was the purview of another character, Gus Franklin, the NTSB investigator. The trick became to find an ending to Scott’s story that had as much intrigue and emotional power as the book’s central mystery. The solution to both the mystery and to this question came to me while writing the book, and once realized was never questioned.</p>\n<p><strong>Your portrayal of the media was (unfortunately) extremely accurate. Do you think that people are really that interested in every detail about a celebrity, or is the interest perpetuated by the media?</strong></p>\n<p>Once upon a time the main focus of our lives was on our lives, our personal journeys. Within this, we carved out a certain percentage of attention for world events and the lives of strangers. Recently, however, that balance has shifted. The volume of the world has increased, as has our ability to monitor it in real time. This sense that something important is always happening, that we’re missing it if we don’t check our devices constantly, is becoming a barrier to living. Click-throughs, page views and retweets are a siren song, tempting us to check out on our families, our work, ourselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you see any of yourself in Scott? Is lack of privacy just something to be expected when you're working in the entertainment industry?</strong></p>\n<p>The plus side of being a writer is — there’s only so famous one can become. The work is what matters.</p>\n<p><strong>This is your fifth book! Is releasing your fifth book as exciting as your first?</strong></p>\n<p>A book release is like a high school graduation. You watch the child you’ve raised, into whom you’ve invested years of work and worry. How can you not be excited? Hopeful, filled with pride?</p>\n<p><strong>Has how you approach writing a book changed over the years?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve learned to trust the process, to let the book reveal itself over time. And yet even though a book is a marathon, it is written each day in a sprint. Ideas and inspiration come and I’ve learned to trust my instincts, to make fast choices without necessarily knowing how the day’s work is going to pay off.</p>\n<p><strong>You are a screenwriter as well as a novelist. Are there a lot of similarities in your writing process? Do you consider one more difficult than the other?</strong></p>\n<p>A story is a story, and yet each medium is different. To write a great film you must be a filmmaker, tell the story with the camera. To write a great novel you must break open your characters and themes and explore them from the inside out. And yet, when a book is written it is done. When a script is finished, the hard work has only just begun.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you have to do a lot of research about plane crashes before writing the book? Has writing it changed your feelings about flying?</strong></p>\n<p>I did a lot of research both on how private jet companies operate and on the aftermath and investigation of crashes. To my mind, the enduring fascination with plane crashes comes from our lack of control. That said, statistically, flying is still safer than driving. Which is what I tell myself every time I fly.</p>\n","cover_img":"June_HawleyQA.jpg","post_img":"June_HawleyQA.jpg","author":"Liberty Hardy, Noah Hawley","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-06-15T13:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p>Judge Liberty Hardy knows a good suspense novel.

Laid out on the kitchen counter were a dozen bagels with lox, heirloom tomatoes, capers, and a local artisanal cream cheese.” (Page 156) Get your own breakfast spread in order, and chow down while thanking your lucky stars you’re on solid ground.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/ModernFBFood.jpg\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/more-books/modern-lovers-128\"><i>Modern Lovers</i></a> by Emma Straub</strong></p>\n<p>One of the central characters in the novel, Zoe, owns a restaurant with her wife, Jane, called Hyacinth, in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. There are so many amazing meals to draw from when doing a <i>Modern Lovers</i> food and book pairing - but why not jump right to the end (spoiler alert!) and grab yourself something out of the couple’s newly opened bakery, Hot + Sweet. As chef Jane Kahn-Bennett says, “I would rather have a perfect apple turnover or croissant than some trendy thing any day of the week...There are also chocolate cream pies, cinnamon rolls, and enormous chocolate chip cookies.” (Page 349) So bust out your favorite sticky sweet for some delicious reading.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/ShrillFBFood.jpg\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/more-books/shrill-127\"><i>Shrill</i></a> by Lindy West</strong></p>\n<p>Lindy is hilarious.

Most of the meals prepared on the island were scraped together from what limited resources Frances and Ainslie had at the time. However, one mealtime gathering of the island’s inhabitants was a step above the rest: “It was Floreana boar pork roast with potatoes and gravy. I took some of our precious factory-made sugar and prepared a sort of papaya tart. It actually looked appetizing.” (Page 252).

Ever since Blac Chyna infiltrated the dynasty and flipped the script on how the family operates and uses the media, I've just wanted to know more. It's also intriguing to see how people who are famous for being famous make that work in the longer term. Everything about them is consumeristic and aspirational.

She is masterful in dealing with online harassment.</p>\n<p><strong>In <i>Bad Feminist</i> you talk about Vanessa Williams being an early role model for you. Who’s your current role model?</strong></p>\n<p>I have a lot of admiration for Zadie Smith, as of late.</p>\n<p><strong>You also talk about <i>Sweet Valley High</i> and your disappointment with the “10 Years Later” refresh.

What do you get out of writing fiction versus nonfiction? What is your favorite genre or form to write?</strong></p>\n<p>I just love to write and I am not going to ever constrain myself by thinking I can only work in one genre. The only genre I don't write is poetry. I'm simply not good at that and it's fine. There's a lot of amazing poetry out in the world that I get to enjoy. Working across different genres allows me to grow as a writer and it keeps me engaged in the work. In fiction, I get to control the world and write into that world as I see fit. In nonfiction, I get to comment on the world as it is and imagine the better place it could become.

In this hilarious <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/more-books/shrill-127\">memoir</a> (even Lena Dunham says so!), her essays have titles like “You’re So Brave for Wearing Clothes and Not Hating Yourself!” and “Why Fat Lady So Mean to Baby Men?” I mean, how could you not want to be friends with Lindy? Whether you know already her or not, you’ll be smitten in the end.</p>\n<p>Lastly, everyone’s best bookish friend, Judge Liberty Hardy has very explicit instructions for her selection this month, <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/more-books/before-the-fall-130\"><i>Before the Fall</i></a>: do NOT read this on a plane! Not to worry, Liberty only has your best interests at heart with a plane crash mystery, with two survivors and lots of intrigue. It’s a book perfect for those summer weekends when you need to feel better about the fact that you’re <i>not</i> going anywhere fun. Or if you’re getting there by car.</p>\n<p>See?

Why did you first start reading those memoirs, and what particularly stood out to you that you wanted to create a historical fiction novel around her story?</strong></p>\n<p>I've been to the Galapagos Islands with my parents as a teenager. It's always just sort of lived in my imagination as a place I wanted to think more about and visit again. I was searching around for a novel topic after finishing <i>A Nearly Perfect Copy</i>. I had set my first novel in Oklahoma. That meant that I got to visit Oklahoma a lot.</p>\n<p>While Oklahoma is lovely, I sort of thought that maybe I should set a book someplace I really wanted to visit. I set the next book in Paris. Then the book after that, I said, &quot;I'll put it in the Galapagos.&quot; There's a series of murders and disappearances that happened on Floriana. I was reading about those. I love reading about those, so I thought that's where my story would lie.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, that's actually been pretty well documented. There are first-hand accounts of it. There's been a documentary that's being filmed about it. I sort of felt that the truth was actually more interesting than fiction in that situation. Therefore, I would have to look elsewhere for a story. In doing that research, I came across Frances Conway's memoirs. I was just immediately enamored with her voice. She's funny. She's self-deprecating.</p>\n<p>What also struck me about her writing was that there was so much she wasn't saying. It was almost dripping with subtext, and I wasn't sure what that subtext was. I felt like there was a whole story behind her story. That, of course, is an absolutely fertile place for fiction to grow. My imagination started running wild. That was when I started imagining, &quot;What life has she led that has led her to write these memoirs that are so dripping with subtext?&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>About that subtext, this will be a little bit of a spoiler-alert. What made you think that Ainslie and Frances' marriage was perhaps a sham?</strong></p>\n<p>I would call it a non-traditional marriage. I think that there's real feeling there. I think that the partnership is very real. I think it is definitely not what we considered then and still consider today as marriage in the traditional sense. I did somehow pick up from the memoir that Ainslie, perhaps, had a drinking problem. When I went to the Galapagos and met some descendants of people who've known them, they confirmed that one of the reasons they came to the Galapagos was to dry out because Ainslie had a problem with alcohol.</p>\n<p>I was looking at photos of them. She's so much older. She's 11 or 12 years older. She's rather plain-looking. He is a tall, handsome, dashing, 40-year old in these photos. They just seem kind of incongruous. I thought, &quot;What has brought these people together that seemed somewhat unlikely?&quot; That was where I started thinking about what situation would have brought these two people together. They seem like an unlikely couple, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, I definitely thought that. What about the evidence that they were really sent to spy on Germans?</strong></p>\n<p>There is a rumor that still exists, that still suggests today, that they were there to look after the Germans. That rumor is somewhat founded by the fact that probably Ainslie wrote a government report on the feasibility of Floriana as an Air Force base. Most likely, they were contacted by the government after they'd already been living there. It seems pretty unlikely that they were spies.</p>\n<p>That's why it's so fun to write fiction because it makes it so much more interesting. There is slightly more of an input. Some of the Germans that were living there were, at the very least, reporting occurrences back to the German government at the time. I'm not sure that any of the people living there were sent there as spies. Certainly, everyone who was there was keeping their eyes open and reporting activities back to the government.</p>\n<p>The Galapagos Islands, actually, could have played a very important role in the 2nd World War. It would be a great staging area if you were going to attack the Panama Canal which, at that time, would have crippled the United States supply chain. I think there was strategic importance. It was enough that the American government put an Air Force base on the Galapagos Islands during the 2nd World War. Like all fiction, the bar for possibility is possibility. Could it possibly have happened? I think it could possibly have happened and so, therefore, I feel comfortable setting a novel in that situation.</p>\n<p><strong>We talk about that a lot because we feature a lot of historical fictions. One of our guest judges, Craig Ferguson, who endorsed <i>The Moor's Account</i>, his whole premise was just that - it <i>could have happened</i>.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah. To me, too, the interesting thing about it is the characters. What do the characters do? How do the characters react? As long as it's not a completely strained credulity, I think watching the characters react to these situations is what the pleasure of fiction is to me.</p>\n<p><strong>The core relationship in this story is this life-long friendship between Frances and Rosalie that started when they were younger and continued across the country and into their ripe, old age. Where did you get the idea for that? Was that based on anything in the memoirs?</strong></p>\n<p>A very, very little bit. Both memoirs are dedicated to Rosalie Fisher. In the memoirs, Rosalie makes a very brief appearance as somebody who occasionally will send them a package from the United States. That is really all that’s in the memoirs about her. I was really interested in the ways in which female friendship especially, but just life-long friendship in general, sort of plays out through a lifetime. I have friends from infancy and I'm now in my early 40s.</p>\n<p>I assume that I will still be friends with them when we're in our 80s if we live that long. The ways in which the friendships change and deepen - and then you drift away for a while and you come back to each other - I find that was a really fascinating phenomenon. I wanted to explore that. [I found that] She'd just make a perfect character and sort of a foil for Frances in a lot of ways. Her life is completely opposite from Frances' in a way for both of them to examine their own lives against the foil of the other character.</p>\n<p><strong>Actually, a lot of the books that we're featuring next month, like <i>Modern Lovers</i>, focus on a strong female friendship at the core.</strong></p>\n<p>I think it's really interesting, and it's somewhat under examined too. Female friendships are complex in a way that I think are almost, in some ways, more complex than romantic relationships because they endure for so long.</p>\n<p><strong>Absolutely. I was really interested in the immigrant situation, the Polish versus the German-Jewish immigrant. My grandparents were Polish. They actually didn't escape. They survived the Holocaust, and then came here. I didn't realize that there were these stereotypes around  the higher-class Germans versus the Polish Jews. How did you do that research?</strong></p>\n<p>I was just sort of doing general reading about that in New York. The difference between the German-Jews, who come over in the 1880s and then the Polish-Jews who came a little later in the '90s and then after the turn of the century, the difference was especially marked in New York City and in Chicago and less so in the smaller cities just because the population was less.</p>\n<p>The Germans who came over immigrated for economic opportunity but sort of decided to come over whereas the Polish Jews were poor. They were uneducated. They came over out of desperation, in some ways. There was a real schism in the German population. Do we help others of our religion, or not? They don't speak our language. They're not educated like we are. We don't want to be lumped with them.</p>\n<p>It's really interesting because you see it now with every wave of immigration, there are people who come first and become established, and then a larger group will come later and what responsibilities you have to the wave of immigrants to come later who need more help, who are &quot;bringing your ethnic group&quot; down. I thought that was a really interesting phenomenon that I wanted to explore and the ways in which both sides are complicit in that hierarchy.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah. I found it fascinating. Now moving to the physical book itself, the cover artwork. How did that come about? It’s gorgeous.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah. I sort of brainstormed some ideas with my editor. Then they wanted to hire an outside illustrator which I thought was a really great idea. This particular illustrator has done work for L’Occitane. I love the organic nature of his artwork. I love the repeating pattern of it which I thought really tied in schematically with the book.</p>\n<p>Then they sent the initial drawings over, and I thought it was fantastic. I wish I could say that I had more of a hand in designing it, but it really was the design team and this outside illustrator. I think the best covers, first of all, are eye-catching and intriguing but then also that it makes what's between the covers resonate more. I feel like this cover does a great job of that, this sort of uncontrollable lushness of organic life, the ways in which some patterns repeat but some are original and that it's completely uncontrollable.</p>\n<p><strong>My next question was going to be how important do you think it is to have a beautiful cover, but that kind of answers it.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah. I think an excellent book can transcend a not great cover, and I think that a fantastic cover can help sell a book that is okay. Knowing how books are made, I still respond to covers. I know the cover is often very separate from the creation of the book, but still an eye-catching cover will make me pick up the book.</p>\n<p><strong>Between yours, <i>Modern Lovers</i>, <i>The Veins of the Ocean</i>. We have some really nice ones this month.</strong></p>\n<p>I love Alex Chee's cover too. It's like sassy on the front. It's fantastic.</p>\n<p><strong>It's awesome. My final question which I ask all of our authors is how does it feel that your book was selected as a Book of the Month?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm so excited and so proud. I'm really looking forward to hearing what people have to say about the themes that I've brought up in the book. There are so many books published that it does feel extra special to be selected, to have people read and analyze it. I'm just thrilled that it's going to get the book into more hands, have more people talking about it and to introduce more people to Frances.</p>\n<p>I really think that these are the kinds of people who have influenced our history and we never hear about them. We hear about the heads of state. We hear about a hero, but you don't hear about the quieter people who are really shaping of our history.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you Allison!</strong></p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited</i>.</p>\n","cover_img":"EnchantedIslands+(1).jpg","post_img":"EnchantedIslands+(1).jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Allison Amend","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>Just looking at the cover of June selection, <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/more-books/enchanted-islands-131\"><i>Enchanted Islands</i></a>, you’ll know there’s something special about this book.

Was it easier writing about a familiar setting?</strong></p>\n<p>It's funny, setting a book in Mallorca was easy because almost all of the action inside one house, they did go out and do various touristy things and go to the beach and the museums, but almost all of the action took place inside this one house, so in many ways it could have taken place anywhere. With <i>Modern Lovers</i>, I sort of wanted to do the same thing. I wanted the book to exist in a Brooklyn that is real and recognizable, but it wasn't so tied to Brooklyn that it couldn't couldn't happen anywhere else, which is partly why I set the book in this neighborhood called Ditmas Park which is very unlike what most people think of when they think of Brooklyn. It's got big houses and lawns and garages and driveways and things like that. It looks very much like suburban, any town USA. I was actually sort of reluctant to write a Brooklyn book because there are so many of them, and that was how I sort of talked myself into it.</p>\n<p><strong>I read in an interview that you said:\n“The beautiful and terrible thing about New York City is living your life in shared spaces.” I think all of us who live here can relate to that. What’s your craziest New York City story?</strong></p>\n<p>I grew up here, so I sort of don't have very much to compare it to really. I have certainly wept in public, vomited in public, urinated in public, you know, all of those things that you do out of necessity occasionally. Most recently, vomiting out of the open door of a car on the West Side Highway. But that's a highway, that could have happened anywhere. I was nine months pregnant, and it happens.</p>\n<p><strong>That's excused. Are these characters based on anyone you know, having grown up in New York?</strong></p>\n<p>Not specifically. Several years ago I started working on a short story that was partly inspired by a band in my then neighborhood of middle-aged people and I was thinking about what that would be like, to be a teenage kid of older people in a rock n roll band. But then once I realized that it was novel, it really had nothing to do with anyone. Happily all of these people are fictional, although I did go to Oberlin, and several of these characters went to Oberlin. And I did go to private school in New York City like the teenage characters, so I have things in common, I suppose, with all of them.</p>\n<p><strong>New York City, Oberlin...Do you ever get parallels to Lena Dunham, Girls, literary culture?</strong></p>\n<p>Sure. Lena Dunham and I also went to the same high school. I know her a tiny bit. The planet is not that big. I went to both high school and college with tons of people who are writers, and filmmakers, and artists, and I grew up in a certain sort of pocket of New York City, where it's not at all surprising that people have done creative, interesting things. The same is true from Oberlin, I have a lot of friends who are musicians, and poets, and cool people.</p>\n<p><strong>We featured a book in May, <i>&amp; Sons</i>, by David Gilbert, which our Guest Judge Josh Radnor picked and which portrayed a very different part of literary New York.</strong></p>\n<p>I love that book, that's a great book.</p>\n<p><strong>It is a great book. There's so many worlds within that literary New York world.</strong></p>\n<p>I'm happy to be included in the young, female literary universe. I think there are so many cool, smart, young women writers nowadays. And Lena Dunham is doing a really fabulous job I think with her Lenny newsletter, of highlighting a lot of those people who aren't the old school New York City writers.</p>\n<p><strong>Who would play Lydia in the real-life movie of Mistress of Myself?</strong></p>\n<p>I don't know she'd have to be a young, angry-looking girl...hmmm who's good and angry? It's funny I've thought a lot about various parts of the book and have it be translated into film and there's a filmmaker who's working on an adaptation right now. I haven't thought about Lydia. I guess she's in the background for so much of the action that I think of her as sort of a ghost in the book, so I don't know that's a hard question.</p>\n<p><strong>I see Zoe as a Lisa Bonet type character.</strong></p>\n<p>Oh yeah, yeah. I love her. And then her daughter can play Ruby.</p>\n<p><strong>Perfect. I hope that happens.</strong></p>\n<p>Me too.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you find that your contemporaries are those who are a little older than you are experiencing any similar life transitions to those that the characters go through in this book?</strong></p>\n<p>I do know a lot of people who have kids who are starting to leave the nest. I mean certainly when my older brother left for college. My parents sort of flipped out in a way that I had not anticipated, because they'd always been very chill. But I think it's really, really a weird transition to go from being in charge of a kid's every meal and every move for 18 years and then to suddenly be faced with the idea that they're moving out and that they have their own lives, that they're sort of in charge of themselves. I have two sons now, one is 3 months and one is almost 3 years and I can't imagine, I never want them to leave me, I want them to stay with me forever, you know.</p>\n<p><strong>Spoiler alert question: Where did the idea for kombucha bust come from? Were you mocking the cultish obsession with workouts like hot yoga, barre, soulcycle…</strong></p>\n<p>Well I don't know how much you pay attention to what former child-stars are doing in Venice, California, but there is this actor named Andrew Keegan who was in <i>Ten Things I Hate About You.</i></p>\n<p><strong>I loved him.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, he either started or was a part of a start of a cult sort-of-thing in Venice that I kept reading about that I just thought was so hilarious. I knew I needed something for Andrew [from <i>Modern Lovers</i>] to sort of fall into. He needed something because he's a guy who's in his 40s and he still hasn't found his thing. And so he's highly susceptible to outside influence. I thought like a yoga cult, what can be better than that? It promises transcendence and you're surrounded by young, hot bods.</p>\n<p><strong>Your book cover is beautiful. How important is it to have a really gorgeous book cover?</strong></p>\n<p>I would say it is of vital importance. With <i>The Vacationers</i> certainly I think that the book got good reviews and all that, but I don't think it would have sold half as many copies if it had a different book jacket. I think you need book jackets to be things that people are drawn to and that people want to pick up and fondle. It is the most important marker of what a book promises to be. And I think sometimes that's where publishers get into trouble. Because they try to sell a certain aspect of a book too much, or too little. I should say also that my husband designs book jackets, so I spend a lot of time talking about fonts and images, in my home life too. I think Riverhead has done such an amazing job with <i>The Vacationers</i> and with <i>Modern Lovers,</i> it's just like making them look the way I feel like they should look, and just doing the most beautiful job giving them faces, that I think suits them. I should also say that I love the <i>Modern Lovers</i> book jacket so much that Leah drew, that in order to not have to worry about what to wear on my book tour, I have ordered two outfits from this company called Print All Over Me, that are just the illustrations from the book jacket.</p>\n<p><strong>That is really cool. I always ask our authors and our Judges, do you have any relationship to Book of the Month and how does it feel that your book was selected as one of our featured five?</strong></p>\n<p>My father is a writer, so I always knew about Book of the Month Club, because I think his books were selections a few times. To me, it makes me think about my childhood. And then also, I really like getting presents in the mail, and I think any sort of subscription service is perfect because then you just have to sit there and wait for your present to come. Especially as a new mom with zero free time - I don't leave the house very much at the moment - anything that comes in the mail is perfect.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks Emma!</strong></p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited</i>.</p>\n","cover_img":"ModernLovers+(1).jpg","post_img":"ModernLovers+(1).jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Emma Straub","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>Emma Straub’s fourth novel revolves around three old college friends, now in their late 40s.

You very maturely and with incredible strength took him on, and he actually apologized. When I found out this was <i>that</i> Lindy West whose book we were evaluating - I was SO excited to read it. And <i>Shrill</i> did not disappoint. So then when I went on your Twitter feed to start researching what questions I would ask you - I saw that very same day you were battling yet another internet troll. You were posting Instagram messages from someone you called, “the moistest little turd I've ever interacted with.” What gives? People still haven’t learned their lessons?</strong></p>\n<p>Well that guy was pretending like he wanted to be featured in my next book. He had listened to <i>This American Life</i> and said he thought that what the troll did in my story was pretty funny, so it inspired him to also come harass me. Then he was like, &quot;you're so nice to the guy on the radio, why aren't you being nice to me?&quot; I don't know what the mental state of these people is - it's kind of baffling to me - but it's not like I expected it to go away after <i>This American Life</i>. It definitely lightened up a bit for a while, just because that piece was so revealing of who internet trolls are. You couldn't listen to that piece not thinking that these are the most pathetic people on the planet. After the piece aired, it was sort of like anyone who came at me for a couple months was just waving a big flag saying, 'I HAVE EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS!'</p>\n<p>So I think it deterred people for a little while, although there was also a backlash in the other direction where I had &quot;truthers,&quot; where there were a bunch of trolls trying to prove that it was a hoax and that I'd hired an actor to pretend to be my troll. You can find it all online if you search 'Lindy West troll hoax.' So that was exciting. But basically, eventually they just go back to normal. This is a problem that's pervasive on the internet, and it has to do with misogyny and the way that men are trained to not regard women as human beings and also to chafe at the notion that feminists might actually change the way gender functions in our culture. So you can't really solve it and expect it to go away until you fix misogyny, which is a tall order. So I definitely think that my piece had an impact - certainly on me personally - but there's still a long way to go.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve tweeted about our June Guest Judge, Roxane Gay and said: “Roxane Gay is a staggeringly elegant thinker who fills and breaks and fills and breaks my heart.” In reference to an article she wrote about <a href=\"http://www.xojane.com/issues/my-body-is-wildly-undisciplined-and-i-deny-myself-nearly-everything-i-desire?utm_medium=facebook\">The Biggest Loser</a>. Neither of you is afraid to discuss topics like feminism and body image and their relationship to pop culture, and all with a sense of humor. I’d put Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer in that camp as well. Do women have to be funny in order to bring up these topics?</strong></p>\n<p>No, that would be kind of a limiting, presumptuous thing to say. Because some people aren't funny, and that's fine [LAUGHS]. Humor happens to be my coping mechanism of choice, and it's a great way to draw people into your writing. But also - I think I don't get taken seriously the way that more academic writers do. I write a lot of jokes. I put a lot of jokes in my work, I include jokes even when I'm writing about things that are serious, and that causes a lot of people to not take me seriously and to think of me as kind of flippant and like I'm maybe not taking these issues seriously, when really I'm just writing from my perspective and the way my brain works and always has worked is that I process things through humor. So it has its pros and cons. I think that it definitely, for some people, is a really great way to engage readers and I sometimes think about my work as grinding up an aspirin and putting it in applesauce or pudding. To draw people in with work that's just straight ahead funny, but also contains within some less palatable ideas about feminism and social justice. And that's been really successful for me, but I don't think it's <i>necessary.</i> I don't think it's the <i>only</i> way to get your point across. But no, my answer is I don't think so. It can be really helpful, but it can also be -</p>\n<p><strong>Detrimental?</strong></p>\n<p>Detrimental - a little bit - I mean I wouldn't trade it. If people want to not take me seriously, that's a failure of their reading, not a failure of my writing.</p>\n<p><strong>Let's talk about the process of writing this book - you're used to writing for these blogs and on your own twitter account, with instant feedback from your audience. How is it different working on a longer-form project like a book, and having to wait for all of that feedback?</strong></p>\n<p>Ohmygod it's SO different. It's so different. It's so different to the point that I kind of forgot people were ever going to read it and I'm really freaked out right now. Because it's so scary, because also when you're not getting that instant feedback - when I'm writing for a blog or for something that's going to run tomorrow - I'm really careful. I'm cautious, and I don't make myself extravagantly vulnerable the way that I do in this book. But just sitting along in your house for a year - I got into some really intense personal issues that normally I might have thought twice about, if I was just going to throw it up online. I think it's good ultimately for the book. I think that makes it a more, sort of layered, nuanced, piece of writing. And I'm glad that it has that depth to it. But yeah it's definitely different. It was a really, really isolating, solitary process that was really hard. Surprisingly hard. It was harder than I expected. Especially when you've never done it before there's a lot of uncertainty. I was really worried the whole time I was going to accidentally write an 80,000 word blog post and not really exhibit any growth or be able to build something cohesive. I think in the end I did, and I'm really proud of what I made.</p>\n<p><strong>Awesome, I think you did too. Why did you decide to write a book? Was it with that in mind, that it would be this larger story with an arc, why was it the format that you chose at this time?</strong></p>\n<p>On the one hand, it just seemed like the natural progression. Like, OK I've been a working writer for a decade, I guess the next thing you do is write a book. But beyond that, I was really ready to challenge myself and to see what I was capable of. And I had spent so many years before I was a feminist, political columnist (or whatever you would call me now), as a film critic. And now I comment on the news of the day, and I comment on pop culture, and I analyze that through a feminist lens. And I love doing that, but it's still observing other people doing things and then commenting on them. I really felt a little bit stuck and wanted to transition into <i>not</i> being the person who comments on other people's work, but being the person who <i>makes</i> art. Who makes primary sources. You know? I don't know where that impulse comes from, it just felt like I wanted to see what I could do, and I was frustrated with my work always being dependent on other people's work. Obviously my work isn't independent of everyone else's work because I've spent my whole life being influenced by other writers and other thinkers, but I just mean - when you're a critic, your work can't exist on its own. It's secondary, you know. So I just really wanted to make something.</p>\n<p><strong>Based on your experience so far, do you want to write another one? Or too early to tell?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh I definitely want to. Especially now that I know how to do it, it's not so scary. And I ultimately really enjoyed the process even though it was really challenging. So yeah, I think I'm going to move on to writing another book proposal, and hopefully transition straight into that once promoting this book is done. I really enjoyed it a lot. I think the medium was really fun to work in and I have more things to say!</p>\n<p><strong>Our Judge who selected your book is Joel Stein, who wrote a book called <i>Man Made: A Stupid Quest for Masculinity</i>, in which he explores the role of manliness for the twenty-first-century urban guy. In his endorsement essay of your book, he wrote: “I finished Shrill a little less judgy than I began. Toward fat people on airplanes. Toward people terrorized by anonymous Twitter users. Toward people who like wizards.” Was that the intention? Was that what you hoped to achieve with this book - less judgment?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely. I think that the power of personal storytelling is that it's very humanizing, and it helps people get to know you. I think that as a woman, and as a fat person, I feel myself being actively dehumanized all the time. So I wanted to create something that was a deeply humanizing portrait of a fat feminist woman, and also make it engaging and funny and hopefully charming [laughs] so that people would enjoy reading it, and really get a sense of who I am as a human being. And then once then they like me, then it's like, &quot;Haha, you like a fat person!&quot; [Laughs] You know, &quot;You thought you hated us, but you <i>don't</i>, see? See how we're nice and funny and smart?&quot; So yeah that was definitely on my mind when I was working on it. I think that the assumptions people make about the people around them are often cruel and self-serving and I wanted to put something out in the world that counteracts that a little bit.</p>\n<p>Also, I don't want to make Joel Stein feel old, but I used to read him when I was a teenager, and I was a big fan. If you want to let him know.</p>\n<p><strong>I don't think he gets offended very easily, so I think you're fine with that.</strong></p>\n<p>[We laugh]</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think platforms like Twitter should be doing to combat harassment and this angry vitriol that you've been experiencing? Do you think they should be doing anything? Do you think they've taken steps since the time of the <i>This American Life</i> troll?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, they have taken steps and I know they're working on it. I don't know, if I had the solution, I would have told them. [Laughs] I don't know, I'm not a computer programmer. I don't know how to make these platforms function better. I do know that one thing that helps is having women writing code. Having women on the actual tech side, where they can offer an insight into how harassment affects female users that male developers might not have. I think that's really important. I think having women in management roles where they're directing the priorities, and at least just having a say in the priorities, is really helpful. Because what we've seen is that we know they've put some time and money into figuring this out, but in terms of actual fixes, what have we seen? It's like, now the favorite button is a heart instead of a star. [We laugh] What is that? You know what I mean? But people are definitely working on it. It might not be possible to fix. Until someone invents a new social network that somehow eliminates the ability to troll altogether, and also it becomes popular enough that <i>everyone</i> uses it, which is just such a tall order, all we can do is make it easier for users I think to control what they see. So what's the best for me is some of these tools that make it possible to block large numbers of people at once. I use Chrome Blockchain extension, where I know the &quot;ring leaders&quot; who send people to harass me, there are just a handful of men with high numbers of followers who hate me and regularly post inflammatory things about me so their followers will descend upon me. With the Blockchain extension I can just go to those users' pages and block all of their followers at once, which is awesome. Honestly that has changed the experience of using the platform tremendously. Just that.</p>\n<p><strong>Wow, I didn't realize there were marching orders sent out.</strong></p>\n<p>For sure, that's a huge problem. Part of the problem, also, is that the way that the reporting function works, it doesn't take context into account. Because it's not like I get death threats everyday. What I get are hundreds and hundreds of jackasses who have been sent by king jackass to just say slightly irritating, insulting things all day. So you can't report that. If the report function doesn't take context into account, you can't just report someone for saying &quot;shut up,&quot; or &quot;shut up you're fat.&quot; That's not a ban-able offense, nor should it be. But when it's part of an army of hundreds and hundreds of people coming and all saying that to you at once, that actually does have an effect, that is harassment, and they sort of skirt consequences. Each individual message can be relatively benign, but when you're in the middle of hundreds of them, it's really alarming and <i>very</i> distracting. It makes it really hard to do your work. So I don't know. I wish I knew how to fix twitter. [Laughs] I do know that they're trying. I know that there are people there who genuinely want to figure this out. It might not be possible to retroactively make this system troll-free, since trolls have already figured out how to exploit the system.</p>\n<p><strong>My final question for you - how does it feel that your book was selected by Book of the Month as a featured title?</strong></p>\n<p>Aww. I'm so delighted and so honored. I still feel like I just started this job - you know? [Laughs] I feel like I'm still just a new writer figuring this out, so to be recognized by such an old, respected entity, it really means a lot. It's very validating and I'm gonna go have a glass of champagne. I'm deeply grateful.</p>\n<p><strong>Good - you should!

I had already written the prologue - the scene where five-year-old Jacob slips his hand from his mother's and is hit by a car. It was inspired by a real life hit-and-run in Oxford when I was a young police officer, although the similarities end there. Sometime later I saw a magazine article illustrated with a photograph of a name written in the sand. I pictured a woman living by the sea in a very isolated cottage, making a living by writing people's messages in the sand. Gradually the character built up in my head. I knew she was escaping tragedy, but I wasn't sure exactly what that tragedy was. Then I remembered the opening scene I'd written, and the two halves of the story came together.</p>\n<p><strong>How much did the book change from your original idea, if at all?</strong></p>\n<p>The basic story remained the same, but over the course of eight drafts it became darker and twistier!</p>\n<p><strong>Did you have writing a book with a big twist in mind when you set out, or did it come to you after you started?</strong></p>\n<p>There are a few twists and turns in <i>I Let You Go</i> which came later - perhaps on the fourth or fifth drafts - but the Big Twist (!) was there right from the start. I wanted to play with the reader a little, and to challenge some of the assumptions we all naturally make about people and situations.</p>\n<p><strong>You have to phrase things just so in order to pull off the big twist - did you find that an easy or difficult part of writing the book?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I found that aspect incredibly challenging. There's one paragraph in particular - the end of a chapter - where a single semi-colon makes a crucial difference. That level of detail is exhausting but very satisfying.</p>\n<p><strong>How much of a role did your experience on the police force play in the details?</strong></p>\n<p>I didn't really have to do any research for this particular book, because it was all familiar territory for me. When I'm reading crime fiction and thrillers I'm always impressed when the author writes authentic police characters. For me I'm less concerned about procedure being a hundred percent accurate - it is fiction, after all - but more sensitive to the realism of a situation. Police officers calling each other 'Detective', for example, is something I see a lot in British crime fiction, but never happens in real life!</p>\n<p><strong>Will we be seeing more of Kate and Ray?</strong></p>\n<p>I've got no plans at the moment to return to Ray and Kate, but never say never!</p>\n<p><strong>Would you like to write a novel that doesn't involve the police or detectives?</strong></p>\n<p>I would! In fact I tried to with my second book, <i>I See You</i>. I wrote the first quarter just from one point of view, without a police viewpoint at all, but it didn't work. I needed that alternative perspective, and I had new police characters jumping around in my head, demanding to be written, so I gave in… There is a book I'm desperate to write which isn't a thriller or crime novel at all. Maybe one day…</p>\n<p><strong>What's it like having a book released in another country? Is it as exciting as the first time?</strong></p>\n<p>It is JUST as exciting! I've found the US launch a little more nerve-wracking, actually. When <i>I Let You Go</i> came out in the UK no one had heard of it (or me!) so there was no pressure at all. It was a Sunday Times top ten bestseller for twelve weeks, and has sold half a million copies here, so now I'm much more nervous about what you guys think of it in the States!

You spent time in NYC while attending NYU. How do you think this novel represented New York?</strong></p>\n<p>There are so many New Yorks, and <i>&amp; Sons</i> touches a lot of them, though its action mostly takes place on the Upper East Side whereas my New York has always been solidly below 14th Street. New York changes every ten blocks, and it's this perpetually mutating quality that makes it such a magical city.  Gilbert paints a really vivid picture of the city - the Frick museum and Central Park pop to mind. Oh, and the Brooklyn Bridge. If ever there was a 'New York novel,' this is it.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you like LA compared to NYC?</strong></p>\n<p>The two cities are compared constantly and it's really unfair as it's difficult to think of two major American cities that are more different. What's great about one is lacking in the other and vice versa. I love living in California and I'm a great defender of Los Angeles when it's under assault from East Coast denizens (which is often.) I've grown to appreciate not being crushingly depressed and vitamin D deficient in February. I heard this once: &quot;New York is a city you love immediately and grow to hate, and L.A. is a city you hate immediately and grow to love.&quot; I'm not sure about the former (I continue to love New York) but I stand by the latter - the longer you're in Los Angeles the more its charms reveal themselves to you. The traffic is as horrible as every cliche tells you it is. Other than that, it's a great town.</p>\n<p><strong>You have two sisters. Is your relationship with them at all like the sibling relationships portrayed in &amp; Sons?</strong></p>\n<p>God, no! The brothers in <i>&amp; Sons</i> are so distanced from each other, though the two older brothers share some happy youthful memories. It's almost the reverse with my sisters. We were at each other's throats quite a bit as kids and as adults have found a real sweetness and ease with each other. I'm a big fan of both of my sisters. They're terrific people. We fully have each other's backs.</p>\n<p><strong>Your character Ted Mosby was full of wise words and wisdom throughout the 9 seasons, and 208 episodes of HIMYM. Are there any Ted Mosby words of wisdom that have stayed with you?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, there are two Ted Mosbys really. There's older, wiser, narrator Bob Saget-voiced Ted and then there's the younger Ted who looked and sounded a lot like me. I always questioned whether older Ted was a reliable narrator (he's certainly editing some for his kids and curiously leaving in all sorts of stuff that might have been better left to the imagination) And younger Ted sometimes said things that he certainly believed in the moment but were perhaps fueled by some misplaced passion. Still, I think both Teds do possess some wisdom, but I wouldn't take everything they say as gospel. Ted's a beautiful guy, but flawed (like all of us.)</p>\n<p><strong>Your current role on PBS' &quot;Mercy Street&quot; takes place during the Civil War. If you could live at any time in history and in any place – when and where would it be?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm having a terrific time with &quot;Mercy Street&quot; - no question I prefer fake Civil War to the real one. As a pain-averse fan of anesthesia and modern dentistry, I'm grateful to be alive in this moment. That said, ancient Greece and Rome have always exerted a pull. I think studying with Socrates or Epictetus would have been pretty great.</p>\n<p><strong>You're also a screenwriter and director. Any plans to write a book? Our March Guest Judge Craig Ferguson suggested you two write a book together, what about that?</strong></p>\n<p>Did Craig suggest that when I was a guest on his show? I don't know how that would go (no offense, Craig!) But I know he's a big reader and that we both love the Lawrence Block Matt Scudder books. I am actually writing a book. But I can't say much more about it other than that I'm writing it. I write in a lot of different forms - prose, plays, screenplays, I'm even writing songs with my friend Ben Lee. Some things want to be told cinematically or theatrically, and other things feel like songs or essays. I try to let the content dictate the form.</p>\n<p><strong>How do acting, writing, and reading compare as different outlets for you?</strong></p>\n<p>They all kind of inform each other. And I'm always striving to achieve some kind of balance among the three. Most really great actors I know are voracious readers. And I'd think it impossible to be a good writer who isn't also a good reader. Actors, writers, and readers are all in the empathy game, stepping into experiences that are not their own. Which I think is essential to being a thoughtful, alert, and awake human being. I place reading up there with the other essentials: air, food, water, shelter, and relationships. Without stories we're lost.</p>\n<p><strong>You've talked about your public persona - and not wanting to be a narcissist or a &quot;reclusive weirdo&quot; who doesn't leave the house (similar to A.N. Dyer in &amp; Sons). How is this going?</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks for asking! I think it's going well. I mean, I am leaving the house fairly regularly, so I seem to be keeping the 'reclusive weirdo' at bay. I might not be the best to judge the narcissist piece. I hope I'm doing okay in that regard (Please don't ask around, just take my word for it…) It's important for me to find a way to stay creative while being engaged with the world. I don't buy into the tortured artist myth. Suffering, depression, and isolation tend to cripple me creatively so anything I can do to stay healthy and connected to others only serves me as a person who makes things for a living.</p>\n<p><strong>You regularly quote great writers. What are some of your favorite quotes?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh, so many. Sometimes you're bending over backwards to express something and you find someone already said it infinitely better and more concisely than you ever could, so it's nice to have great quotes on hand. A sharp quote on reading via David Foster Wallace: &quot;The purpose of reading is to disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed.&quot;  This from William Blake should hang above every writer's desk (and/or preface every book): &quot;Dear Reader, forgive what you do not approve, &amp; love me for this energetic exertion of my talent.&quot; These wise words from Robert Anton Wilson: &quot;You are precisely as big as what you love and precisely as small as what you allow to annoy you.&quot; And I return to this often, from the Sufi mystic Al-Ghazali: &quot;Know, O Beloved, that man was not created in jest or at random, but marvelously made and for some great end.</p>\n<p><strong>Reading is a big part of your life. All-time favorite books? What's the one book you would bring with you to a deserted island?</strong></p>\n<p>I feel there are certain books that speak to us at certain moments (i.e. <i>One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest</i>, senior year of high school) and were we to pick them up again years later they perhaps wouldn't make much of a dent (I haven't reread OFOTCN so I'm not speaking of that specifically) And that, of course, works in reverse: I never got (or even finished) <i>The Great Gatsby</i> when I was supposed to read it in school but then I read it a few years ago and was completely bowled over by it. Sometimes I think we're asked to read certain books before we're ready for them. Over the years I've been deeply affected by Philip Roth, Lorrie Moore, Milan Kundera, Etgar Keret, DFW, and many many others. Spiritually I've drawn great inspiration from the Bhagavad Gita, The Tao Te Ching, C.S. Lewis, and Swami Sivananda, to name a few. Re: the deserted island, I think I'd be a fool not to bring a complete Shakespeare. It's all in there and it would take a few lifetimes to absorb it all so that seems a wise choice.</p>\n","cover_img":"BOM_Mag_Radnor.gif","post_img":"BOM_Mag_Radnor.gif","author":"Book of the Month, Josh Radnor ","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>May Guest Judge Josh Radnor, best known for his role as Ted Mosby in &quot;How I Met Your Mother,&quot; selected a book about New York, family, and writing - all topics Josh is intimately familiar with.

I somehow got it in my head that the book was long and forbidding (it was physically heavy) and I kind of semi-consciously started to view it as homework. I try to read these days for either pleasure or edification, but a mixture of the two is what I really seek. All of which is to say I was totally wrong about <i>&amp; Sons</i>. It turned out to be a swift and gorgeous read, both nourishing and wildly entertaining.</p>\n<p><i>&amp; Sons</i> centers around a spectacularly famous though reclusive older author named Andrew &quot;A.N.&quot; Dyer, who is much more skilled as a writer than as a father. His coldness has left him adrift from his two older sons, Richard and Jamie, and in a late-in-life act of penance he attempts a do-over with his third son, seventeen year-old Andy, the product of an affair which destroyed his marriage to Richard and Jamie's mother.</p>\n<p>The book is topically narrow (literary New York) but thematically huge, the story a prism through which Gilbert examines, well, everything: fathers and sons, husbands and wives, success and failure, aging and youth. The book starts and ends with a funeral. It's bookended by death but in its pages there's a whole lot of life. Which is not to say life, or lives, well-lived. <i>&amp; Sons</i> is populated by vividly drawn, well-meaning characters who can't quite say what they feel and manage to offend when their intention is the exact opposite.</p>\n<p>My father (a man very much unlike the withholding patriarch at the center of this book) and I have an ongoing, amusing debate about narrative. He is often baffled/frustrated that fictitious characters make such bone-headed illogical decisions and screw up their lives so badly. My response is that no one wants to watch people make a series of good decisions. It's inherently undramatic. Drama is about conflict and obstacle and for those elements to be present, people have to screw up. I'm not even sure I entirely believe that all the time (functional, healthy people can be dramatically compelling) but the twists and turns of <i>&amp; Sons</i> do illustrate my point.</p>\n<p>Gilbert's prose is consistently startling; I found myself underlining passages every few pages. Some of my favorites: &quot;Grace commanded the second pew, her whole family jammed together, the six of them sour and insistent, like the richest people flying coach.&quot; On Andy: &quot;…this 17 percent boy with the zit goatee and the shaggy hair and the stubborn baby fat around his middle like he was halfway through digesting his younger softer self.&quot; A character described as &quot;baseball handsome.&quot; Another: &quot;She would make a fabulous stepmother someday.&quot;</p>\n<p>Reading <i>&amp; Sons</i> reminded me of the pleasures of literary fiction, of being granted access to a rarified, insular world populated by characters I didn't know I needed in my life until they were there. My acting teacher at NYU, Ron Van Lieu, used to urge his students to &quot;expand your definitions of yourselves.&quot; This is what books are so uniquely good at - granting a backstage pass to experiences which are not our own. David Foster Wallace once said we're all marooned in our own skulls – a true, if depressing, statement. But books are the best remedy we have for this sorry state. I'm glad I'm not A.N. Dyer – or his sons – but I feel enlarged by having spent time in their company.</p>\n","cover_img":"663x400_SonsRoof.jpg","post_img":"663x400_SonsRoof.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Josh Radnor","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>May Guest Judge Josh Radnor explains why a seemingly daunting literary fiction novel proved him wrong and completely enriched his life.</i></p>\n"},{"id":106,"title":"<p>Behind the May selections</p>\n","subtitle":"<p>Background on this month's five titles</p>\n","summary":"<p>One of the best and worst parts of my reading life is that moment I've finished an incredible book, one that affects you long after the last page, and then that moment of standing in front of my bookshelf and trying to decide what to read next. If you're anything like me, asking &quot;What comes next?&quot; to your books is simultaneously a daunting and invigorating task.</p>\n<p>If I've just read a fun, light-hearted romp, I'm going to want something a little deeper, something with a bit more substance. And if I've just trekked through a moving and heavy tome, I need some sweetness and light to balance out the dark. No matter which direction you're headed this month, Book of the Month has some incredible books to make your next book equally as memorable as your last.</p>\n<p>We are jam packed on both ends of the spectrum in May. If you're craving a super-fast, fun novel, <i>Eligible</i> is Curtis Sittenfeld's modern retelling of one of my all-time favorites <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. It is the book everyone will be talking about this summer, and whether you know the original Lizzie and Darcy or not, you'll be completely smitten by their courtship.</p>\n<p><i>I Let You Go</i>, a British thriller that readers have already called &quot;gripping,&quot; &quot;tense,&quot; and &quot;clever,&quot; starts with a hit-and-run and only speeds up from there. It's impossible to talk about this twisty mystery without over-the-top gushing so I'm just going to gush. It's one of the most fascinating and expertly crafted thrillers I've ever read. Prepare for at least one sleepless night as you barrel toward the ending.</p>\n<p>Our Guest Judge, Josh Radnor, has chosen a supremely affecting, compulsively readable novel that originally hit shelves three years ago but that definitely deserves a revival. Ostensibly about fathers and sons, David Gilbert's <i>&amp; Sons</i> is, as Josh puts it, &quot;populated by vividly drawn, well-meaning characters who can't quite say what they feel and manage to offend when their intention is the exact opposite.&quot; If you loved the family drama of last month's selection <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=111\"><i>The Nest</i></a>, Gilbert's <i>&amp; Sons</i> won't let you down.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, <i>The Association of Small Bombs</i> by Karan Mahajan and <i>Heat &amp; Light</i> by Jennifer Haigh are powerful novels that promise to both entertain and enlighten. Author Alexander Chee's (of March's <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=105\"><i>The Queen of the Night</i></a>) first selection as a Judge is the story of two brothers in Delhi who are killed by a terrorist's bomb and the ripple effect of that act, on everyone from the boys' family to the terrorist himself. Having lived near the market in Delhi where the blast that inspired this story took place, and then witnessing the media's coverage of terrorists in a post 9/11 world, Mahajan sought to understand what would make someone like you or me turn to such horrific acts. It's a surprisingly easy and quick read for such a fraught topic.</p>\n<p>The fifth BOTM book for May is equally as potent as Mahajan's but with a topic that is right in many of our own backyards. Through the lens of a depressed Pennsylvania town and its inhabitants, Haigh takes on the highly controversial subject of fracking and puts a human face on it. &quot;To drill or not to drill&quot; becomes a personal question and she deftly navigates what could easily turn into a screed and creates instead a moving and elegant portrait of conflict for rural Americans. I finished this stunning work with tears in my eyes and a much deeper appreciation for a topic I previously knew little about.</p>\n<p>It's a month full of fiction that will both delight and move you, and I couldn't be more excited for you to read them all.

How did you go about tackling this very large project?</strong></p>\n<p>When the editors reached out to me, they said, 'we would love to have you participate in this project, and we think that you'd be well-suited to tell a modern version of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. If you're interested in another novel, by Austen, we're open to that too. It was December 2011, and I decided to reread <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> over Christmas, before I gave them an answer. And basically as soon as I started rereading it, I thought - I have lots of ideas for updating it, this would be so much fun, it would be such a joy to live in the world of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> for several years. So that was my thought process in deciding to take on the project. In terms of actually writing it, I didn't start writing it until 2013, because I was in the middle of a different novel when they approached me.</p>\n<p>In 2013, I first did an outline where I summarized everything that happens in each of the 61 chapters of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. And then weeks, if not months, later I did my own outline for <i>Eligible</i>. At first I had thought that I could work off the outline for <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> and say 'OK if this is chapter 7 for <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> this'll be chapter 7 for <i>Eligible</i>.' I realized that, once I changed one thing in <i>Eligible</i>, it led to all these other changes and so I couldn't re-enter in the same place. I think that I did have sort of a breakthrough when I knew that I had to create my own outline.</p>\n<p><strong>You incorporate a lot of modern culture into this retelling - casual dating and sex, reality TV, dating apps, transgender issues. How did you decide what elements of the story you would pull into the 21st century and what parts of the original story you would preserve ?</strong></p>\n<p>I thought in terms of structure and plot. If there are two characters who have a conflict, or if there's a character who has a secret - what should that secret be? Then I would consider various possibilities. I never thought, 'I want to introduce these five modern themes into my book, or I want to make comments about reality TV,' it was more like, sort of working in the opposite way, and thinking, for instance with the reality TV: I need to get this single man to Cincinnati, Ohio, I need everyone in Cincinnati to know he's arrived, and to know he's single, well one way of doing that is if he had been on a reality dating show. I really think in terms of structure and making things move forward.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you decide on the eldest Bennet sisters' professions - a yoga instructor and a journalist at a magazine?</strong></p>\n<p>I did want to preserve the general personality traits of the characters in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> without making the characters identical to their counterparts, or their predecessors, and so I just thought, OK Jane is supposed to be this serene, kind, lovely person, and that seemed compatible with being a yoga instructor. Meanwhile, Liz is observant, and funny, and kind of fearless, which is more compatible with being a journalist. Of course, I have worked as a journalist, I've never been an investigative reporter or a war correspondent, but I've done enough journalism that I could also have fun drawing from my own experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>Chip went to Harvard Medical School and was also on a dating show - Eligible. Is this the modern day aristocrat? Ivy League educated but willing to find love on national television?</strong></p>\n<p>I think in the United States, in the present day, there's different kinds of so-called &quot;aristocracy.&quot; I probably could have set the entire book in Silicon Valley, obviously it has a Silicon Valley element, but it's definitely not a Silicon Valley novel. I could have set it in Hollywood, or it could have been Wall Street, or something. I think it's more like he's upper class, he's well educated, he comes from a financially stable background, and he's a doctor. I didn't need for him to be like the George Clooney of men, he just had to be a desirable bachelor.</p>\n<p><strong><i>Eligible</i> highlights the fact that there are still social pressures for women to marry. You aged these women about 20 years to 40 years old, so in about 200 years [since Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>] they went about 20 years. Do you think in another 200 years the same pressures will exist?</strong></p>\n<p>It would be nice if it no longer existed. I think one of the differences between the present day and the early 1800s is that the pressure to marry still exists but it's almost a more symbolic pressure. There are financial benefits to marriage, in terms of healthcare and taxes, but really if you don't want to get married, you don't have to get married. You might still have to explain yourself, but you're certainly not going to be shunned. Probably anyone that you'd have to explain yourself to you wouldn't necessarily want to be friends with. So I think the pressure definitely still exists, and I do think that 40 is a kind of symbolic age where people might think - if you're not married by the time you're 40, why are you not married? Or, did you want to be married, and you didn't find the right person, or did you never want it? There's all these nosy questions. I don't think that it's necessary for anyone - man, woman, etc. - to marry to have a fulfilling life, but I think that there is a larger social belief that that's still the ideal among most people, not among everyone, but among most people.</p>\n<p><strong>Is Liz Bennet your favorite character in the novel?</strong></p>\n<p>Well I love her but I also see her as flawed in <i>Eligible</i>, probably more flawed than in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. I have a soft spot for most of my characters, and I like Mary. [Laughs]</p>\n<p><strong>What about her in particular? She's very different from her other sisters.</strong></p>\n<p>She's just such a grouch. How can you not love a grouch?</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think Chip / Jane and Liz / Darcy live happily ever after?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh god, of course not! Who does?</p>\n<p><strong>Who do you think has a stronger relationship?</strong></p>\n<p>That's an interesting question. I think the couples are very compatible. I think certainly you could not swap the men and maintain the happiness that they all finally get - I think that they've all found their soulmate.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any other classic stories you would like to retell?</strong></p>\n<p>There's definitely some fairytales that I find really fascinating but there's nothing specific that comes to mind. I work on a novel for three or so years and then I feel ready to do something pretty different from what I was just working on. So I'm not totally clear on what my next novel will be, but I do not think it will be borrowing the existing architecture of another story.</p>\n<p><strong>That was going to be my next question - what you're working on now?</strong></p>\n<p>I have two pages of another novel [Laughs], which is almost the same as it not existing.

When did you decide you wanted to write a book about this topic?</strong></p>\n<p>I had the idea for the book, not in the 90s when this bombing happened in Lajpat Nagar Market near where I grew up in Delhi—I was only 12 years old—but in 2009, soon after the Mumbai attacks. The Mumbai attacks were internationally televised and the hotels in the city were under siege for four days. The trauma I experienced watching those attacks on television brought me back to this much smaller attack that happened in a place that I knew well. I had an urge to try to understand what a small attack like that meant in an era of much larger blasts and attacks that we talk about constantly—9/11, the Mumbai attacks, the Paris attacks. That was the seed of the book.</p>\n<p><strong>You came to America post 9/11, so the fear of terrorist attacks was new to America. Did you grow up living in fear of terrorism and bombings?</strong></p>\n<p>I didn't grow up with it. They were infrequent enough in India and they were small enough that one didn't think about them all the time. I will say that I was aware of terrorism in a way that someone my age wouldn't have been at that time in America. I knew that it was being caused by political events that were happening far away but had a fallout in my own neck of the woods. The fact that I arrived in the US a week after 9/11 meant that the awareness of terrorism I grew up with never went away, and in fact continued on in the US. When I think about why I was drawn to the subject it's probably because it provides a clean line from my childhood in Delhi to my existence as an adult in America. It's a way of connecting those experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>This book focuses not only on the event but on the victims, their families, and the repercussions of the bombing. How did you do research about what these families and victims might be going through?</strong></p>\n<p>I went back to the market where the bombing happened and talked to a couple of people. The shopkeepers were understandably not very forthcoming about what had happened because it had been 18 years since the blast. It had been traumatic for them. They wanted to forget it. They wanted to forget the fact that the government had let them down, that they hadn't been paid the compensation they felt they deserved, and that the case had dragged on for years. It was interesting to go back and get a sense of their frustrations. I talked to a therapist who treats bomb victims, which was illuminating. In a culture like mine, where grief and trauma are private, it can be hard to deal with something as enormous as the trauma of a bomb blast.</p>\n<p>As for the terrorists, that was probably the hardest part of the research because that was the farthest removed from my own experience. I read widely—everything from books about 9/11 to the Mumbai attacks to the history of terrorism starting in czarist Russia, and the PLO in the 70s. Finally I came across documents and reports that related to this particular bombing that happened in '96 in Delhi. So through a mixture of all of those, and my imagination I was able to construct characters that I thought were credible, and that would offer an insight to readers about how terrorists function on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n<p>One of the mistakes that fiction has made, is that fiction, like the media, has bought into the aura around terrorists. We fear them so much that we can't see them clearly. I wanted to reduce them to humans and to see the basic obstacles they might face, the long journeys they might have to take to plant the bomb, the way they collect the materials for the bomb, their own feelings, and by doing so to give a 360 degree view of this attack that had happened in Delhi.</p>\n<p><strong>I have a question about that. One of the books that we featured was <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=110\"><i>A Mother's Reckoning</i></a> by Sue Klebold, who was the mother of Dylan Klebold, one of the Columbine high school shooters. She has this view that the media should not pay any attention to the shooters, because it puts them up on this pedestal, it causes copycats - giving them any attention at all. Is that in contradiction to your view?</strong></p>\n<p>I don't think it's in contradiction to my view at all. In the novel, there's a terrorist who first appears in 1996 and a younger terrorist who plants a bomb in 2003. Both of these terrorists are small-time operators in India, but they look up to the first World Trade Center bomber in 1993, and to Mohamed Atta, one of the chief architects and hijackers in the 9/11 attacks, respectively. Their attacks are attempts to bring that kind of media-grabbing terror to India. I do agree that there's a kind of coverage of these terrorists that exalts them, that turns them into superhuman villains and that this is bad and leads similarly disaffected men to want to join their ranks. But if they're cut down to size and presented accurately, I don't think there's any reason the media shouldn't cover them. It's the media's duty to do it well. It's just that we get caught up in the sensationalism of the event when it happens and we tend to forget the long arc that preceded it and that follows it as well.</p>\n<p><strong>You've said that you wanted to find a way to explain the absurdity of terrorism. Do you think this book achieved that?</strong></p>\n<p>On a very basic level, it is a strange thing that people protesting a political cause in one country would come to a different country and attack civilians who were not necessarily connected to the cause. When you look at it in that frame, it is a somewhat absurd thing to do, and I wanted to get into the mindsets of the terrorists and see why they use such tactics. And so that was an attempt to diffuse the absurdity. But as I was writing, some of the absurdity came back in, and that pertains, in the book, to the way that terrorists gleefully talk about body counts and whether they want a small bombing versus a large bombing, for example. Or the ways in which they come up with strange justifications for what they're doing and for their own actions. So on the one hand the book does defuse the absurdity of terrorism but on the other it also introduces some absurd elements into it.</p>\n<p><strong>You've said, &quot;My fiction is about my inability to let go,&quot; -- and it's about those stuck between cultures. Are you stuck between cultures - what with your upbringing in Indian and adult life in America?</strong></p>\n<p>I think when I said that it's about the inability to let go I was talking about the fact that I myself am unable to let go of different experiences I've had and the different places I've lived in. I've been gone now from India for a number of years (though I moved back once and I've lived there off and on), but it remains a central part of my imagination, even though in some ways it's been lost to me. Some of my fiction is an attempt to cobble together a whole out of all these fragments of my life. I've lived in Delhi, San Francisco, Brooklyn, Bangalore, and now I'm living in Austin, and it can be difficult as an individual to figure out what the central thread of your life is. Fiction, with characters who move between spaces but are connected by ideas, has given me a way to do that. Terrorism, as I was saying earlier, was another way in which I felt these places were connected.</p>\n<p><strong>You've said (jokingly) that you let down your family - and probably all of India - by attending Stanford and <i>not</i> ending up at Google or Goldman. You became a writer. One of the central characters in your books also chooses a nontraditional path, and perhaps less lucrative path, becoming a documentary filmmaker. Is that a bit of your past infused into that as well?</strong></p>\n<p>The part that is a bit of my past infused into Vikas Kharana is the idea of a character who has become an artist but is drawn to fairly bourgeois ways of living. And that's one of the dark jokes in the book—that as soon as Vikas suffers this immense tragedy, losing his kids, he starts having these dreams of going back into the security of his job as a chartered accountant. That was a comment on how something as major as a bombing or a terrorist attack makes society as a whole not just more conservative but also makes individuals more conservative, makes them more risk averse. That kind of divided character is someone I can relate to because while I've become a writer, I come from a background where no one else was a writer, and where most people work for various kinds of businesses. There's a sense of wrongness I still feel about being an artist. I've found that to be an interesting emotion to try to exploit in my own work.</p>\n<p><strong>Anything else you'd like our readers to know?</strong></p>\n<p>I think a good book is an attempt to see clearly—to see past terms and images that have grown stale for us in the media. I hope my book achieves that.</p>\n","cover_img":"Absolute_Magazine.jpg","post_img":"Absolute_Magazine.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Karan Mahajan ","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p>Judge Alexander Chee selected <i>The Association of Small Bombs</i> as his May Book of the Month.

So that was number one, and I only just did that last week, in preparation for everything that was coming. The second most important one to me was - I'm a Big Brother for Big Brother Big Sisters, and I had to call his mother, because I've been his Big Brother for a few years. I was afraid, because some people have negative connotations with the CIA and they think of the waterboarding and all of that stuff, and I was afraid she'd be like, oh wait - I've let my son hang out with this CIA guy for the past three years - I'm a horrible mother. When I told her she started screaming and - not in agony, but like, 'Say what! You can not be serious right now.' She's like, 'I need to hang up.' She called me back five minutes later, and then she's like 'Hang up, I need to think about this.' Then finally, she's like, 'You know what, I think it's awesome. So keep on keeping on. And I look forward to you telling my son that you've been doing this as well.' So it's been pretty cool. All of that has been a tremendous weight off of my chest.</p>\n<p><strong>What was your parents' reaction?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, at the time, obviously it was a lot for them, to know that your son has been doing this. For my mom the hardest part was, 'Wow my son's been in harm's way for the past ten years.' So she took that really hard. But I said, 'Hey look, I'm here, you can touch me. I'm not scarred in any way. I'm alright.' My dad is a military guy though so he was like, 'Oh great, that's good to hear. I'm proud of you.' Lately though, it's been pretty hard for them, because the media likes to say what the media wants to say. So they've been dealing with all of that different publicity, which is new to them too. Seeing me on television, seeing me in the <i>New York Times</i>, they're like, 'That's our baby.' It's been interesting, but we'll all make it through.</p>\n<p><strong>Did they have any idea?</strong></p>\n<p>So I was shocked at how little idea they had. But the thing is, they live back in the Midwest, so for them, they didn't have as much continual contact with me. Close friends in the DC area - after a while there's only so many weird things you can do before they're like, 'Dude, just tell us.' But for them, they only saw me on the holidays, and I could prepare and be lock-tight with my story about living in Hawaii - and read the <i>Hawaii Times</i> every day before I met them. They were kept the furthest in the dark, and so it was the biggest wow factor for them.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4QFzzVgTN3k?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>What was the process of writing a book like?</strong></p>\n<p>It was my first time so it was a very interesting process, and I look at writing the book the same way I looked at joining the Agency and the same way I looked at leaving the Agency - do I really want to do this? Do I want to continue doing this? Each thing was so novel to me, and new, that I wasn't sure if it was the right path and the right thing to do. Even starting the book, there were many times when I was like, 'I'm just gonna hit delete. Nobody wants to read this stuff.' I'm a huge critic of myself, which you can see in the book. Then going through the clearance process and everything else with the book, it was very time consuming, and I don't want to say that it was any way stressful, but it was certainly a pain at times.</p>\n<p><strong>What have you been doing since you resigned from the CIA? Other than writing?</strong></p>\n<p>I've been getting it cleared, and everything that encompassed writing a book as a CIA Officer. Obviously there's a lot that goes into that, more than just getting an advance and then writing it, as a typical author might do, and then meeting deadlines. I had to work closely with Mark [Of St. Martin's Press], a lot, to say - I can't have a deadline - because the deadline is with the CIA. What are you gonna do? Tell them, 'Hey you've got a headline?' They're gonna go, 'Bye! OK, keep waiting, we don't care. We've got much bigger fish to fry than getting your book out by your deadline.' They had all the power with that. For the past three years I've also been an independent contractor for the Department of Defense, so I've been doing that on the side as well.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_J3QepKDbp8?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>What was the reaction like from your friends and ex-girlfriends, who were all mentioned in the book?</strong></p>\n<p>When I say that I stopped contact with my ex-girlfriends, that's when it stopped, at those points in time in the book. And I haven't spoken to them since. So they're finding out in the <i>New York Times</i>, last Friday. I do feel bad about that, in that they know that it's coming out but they can't read it yet. So they've seen all of these precursors and they have to wait until tomorrow to order it. For some of them, I'm assuming, they'll probably take the day off work, [Laughs] and then try to hunt me down. So I'm gonna have to lay low. If there's anybody I have to worry about, it's probably them.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8o8ksgyyAOw?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>I have to say that when reading <i>Left of Boom</i> you reminded me of the character of Carrie Mathison in <i>Homeland</i>. Do you think her characterization is accurate?</strong></p>\n<p>Funny you should mention that. Just a month ago, my close colleague, who also just left the Agency, was telling me about <i>Homeland</i>, because I've never seen it. And I mention it also, because we don't watch a lot of TV. When you're in some of these Fifth World countries, they don't have the same shows, there is no Netflix, you can't just binge. So, it wasn't a possibility. Even still, over the past year since I left, I haven't really gotten a TV. I have internet, obviously, I'm not a caveman, but I've just always been deploying, and being out. So maybe that's what I should tell people my plan is - now that I'm done, is to watch a lot of Netflix. As for Carrie, I watched the first episode with my buddy, and we actually videotaped it, because we knew it would be hilarious. And the first thirty seconds, we're looking at each other like, 'Oh man.' The very first pilot episode, she meets an asset in public, right before she goes into a jail, and she's pulling out an envelope, and paying him in public, and I was like, 'Well he's dead, and so are you, and is there more than one episode? Like what's going on here.' We see that and go, 'Huh?' But then I finished the whole show and we just both talked about it, and we made funny comments throughout. Maybe I should throw that up on YouTube.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lUD3g8mNg2c?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Have you had any lapses back into the vices that you were prone to while working for the CIA?</strong></p>\n<p>How am I now? Well, if I was on oxycontin right now I'd be sedated and unable to do this interview, so clearly I've kicked that, and thank god. I will say though, that period of my life, and that downward spiral thing - as I tried to explain the best I could - that was something that took over me because of the situation I was in, it was the first time I had ever seen that before. I'd had a job since I was 13. Continuously for my entire life up until that point. So now, I'm just sitting around, I've got a broken ankle, I'm already taking these pain pills, and I'm bored, and then I start drinking, and then that started to spiral. It started to snowball. I'm obviously embarrassed that I made those life choices, but it was also something I wasn't not going to include in the book, because it's real, and it shows the type of character and the type of toll this can take on you. I chose to self-medicate, I'm sure a lot of other people have chosen to seek help elsewhere. Maybe through their spouse, maybe through someone else, but for me, I took it so seriously and I was so on 11 the entire time, I didn't talk to anybody else. And I should have. I regret that I didn't. I'm fine now - at least I think. I don't know maybe my friends might tell you I'm still crazy, who knows.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TNlZknwm3GU?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>What are your thoughts on the current geopolitical environment, how our administration is handling everything, and the recent ISIS bombings?</strong></p>\n<p>As a Case Officer, if you're a field guy, you're trained to be apolitical. Meaning, you're gonna do what you're told to do, regardless. Now I have been told that, I wasn't difficult to manage, it's just I wasn't easy to manage, which comes across. Because for me, you can tell me what you want to do, and I'm gonna do it, but you need to explain why. And you need to justify it to me. Telling me, 'Because I said so,' doesn't work. That never worked. As far as what's going on now, yeah I have opinions, anybody could, but political opinions one way or the other, for me, I don't think it's fair as a guy who was privy to such information as an apolitical guy, to start picking and choosing sides now. I was privy to that information because I was apolitical. And to come out now like some people do, and say, 'Oh I'm for Donald Trump. Or, oh I'm for Hilary Clinton, or oh, Barack Obama screwed up.' That's completely unacceptable for me. Because if you do believe that President Obama screwed up, you're only privy to that information because you weren't Democratic or Republican. So you don't have the right to now announce to the world that he screwed up. A lot of people have been painting me as though I said the President's Administration created ISIS. If they want to twist it, because that's what gets their clickbait, and sells papers, they can do what they want, but those words weren't written in my book.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you ever regret leaving the CIA?</strong></p>\n<p>I wouldn't say I regret it. I would say that I miss it, a lot. But I don't regret it. Because writing this book and everything that I've been doing is so unbelievably new to me, and it's a new adventure. I knew what I was getting when I was with the CIA, and quite honestly, I'd be right at my ten year mark, if I was still there. The past three [years] I've still been doing stuff really close to that. So it's been a decade of my life. And I'd like to put it on the shelf, admire it and say hey there it was, and then move forward in another direction. So I guess I really don't regret it. I'm proud of the book. I'm proud that I was able to actually get it out there because like I said, there were so many times I was just gonna hit delete. And it actually got published. And now it's your Book of the Month, so that's pretty awesome.</p>\n<p><strong>Was there anything in particular that made you keep writing?</strong></p>\n<p>I had a co-author, eventually, so he certainly helped. Obviously, once St. Martin's came around, then absolutely I was gonna continue - you've got a publisher now, this is awesome. So then that's kind of like the last step. Like OK great, we can move forward, and it's actually going to happen. I would say just from being so new and not understanding the process - the publishing world moved a lot slower, or in different directions, than what I was used to at the Agency. Not to say that the Agency didn't drag its feet on a lot of stuff sometimes, but I was sitting here going, 'Guys just give me a response, just yes or no?' And I might get one three weeks later, to a month later. I'm going, 'It took you three weeks to write two sentences to me?' So it was very frustrating for me being the go-forward, move, guy that I am. At those points, after two weeks, we'd go, 'Well they hate the book, I'm just gonna get rid of it.' And then you get, 'Hey actually we love it.' And I'm like, 'Why didn't you tell me that two weeks ago? My ego's bruised.'</p>\n<p><strong>What are your plans now?</strong></p>\n<p>Pay my taxes. That needs to happen. That's the first thing I'm going to do. I think I'm going to probably go back and just cut some wood with my dad in Ohio for a while. And then I haven't been to a beach for a really long time so I might find one of those. As far as occupational-wise, no plans.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks, Doug!</strong></p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited.</i></p>\n","cover_img":"LauxBook_663x400.jpg","post_img":"LauxBook_663x400.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Douglas Laux","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>The Book of the Month selection <i><a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=109\">Left of Boom</a></i> is inarguably one of the most entertaining Afghanistan war memoirs we've gotten since the beginning of the post-9/11 conflict.

Do you know anyone who has these kinds of dysfunctional relationships with their siblings?</strong></p>\n<p>[LAUGHS] Yes! I think fighting, particularly over money, as you age, is very, very common. One of the coolest things about the book tour starting - me going out into the world, going to a lot of bookseller conventions, and talking to booksellers - everyone wants to tell me their family money drama stories. Everyone. It's kind of amazing.</p>\n<p><strong>What's the craziest story you've heard?</strong></p>\n<p>It's usually the same thing - parents die, and it's like everyone becomes, I don't even know what word to use, just incredibly proprietary about objects, and houses, and finances, and believing they're owed certain things. I've had people tell me how they have siblings who feel that they were not the favorite and so therefore they should get more money after the parents have died. It's kind of like people keep a little running tab in their head of ways in which they think they have been treated by their parents, and how that differs from how they perceive their siblings were treated by their parents. All of that stuff, all of those old fights and resentments, and emotions, just seem to be fueled by the act of having to distribute things in a house or distribute money, or come to terms with finances, or who's responsible for helping mom and dad, because someone needs a nursing assistant or something like that. And all the old sibling dynamics come into play in ways that are not always admirable.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most powerful dividing force in adult sibling relationships? Do you think it's money, or care taking for elderly parents, spouses that siblings don't like, infidelity, distance, what have you seen along the way?</strong></p>\n<p>I think it's family history. I think that you are born into a story that you have no control over, including who the other people in the story are. And there's this assumption that because you share DNA with people, that then you'll all get along. And that just doesn't happen in a lot of families. It happens in some families, but I think the more kids you have, the more unlikely it is that everyone's going to get along. It's one thing when you're children and you're just arguing about whose turn it is to load the dishwasher. It's a completely different thing when you're adults and you all have different lives and the family keeps expanding and expanding, and then the argument is over who gets that ring that all the sisters want. Or who gets that painting or whatever. And I just think it's all of your history as children that comes into play.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/TheNest_663x400.jpg\" alt=\"Candid\" />\n<i>Photo credit: Camille Perri</i></p>\n<p><strong>So along that theme, what's your favorite trust fund fight of all time? We have a couple of examples: There's been J. Howard Marshall / Anna Nicole Smith, Brooke Astor - another big New Yorker, Ron Perleman.  Anyone else that comes to mind, or any of those?</strong></p>\n<p>You know I grew up in a very middle class, suburban family and I thought trust funds were something that really only existed in books and movies. And then I moved to New York City and found out that they were real. I don't know. People fighting over trust funds is just so pathetic.</p>\n<p><strong>What about Leona Helmsley - what do you think about leaving money to your dogs?</strong></p>\n<p>People can leave money to whomever they want. Leona was not exactly a humanitarian when she was alive.</p>\n<p><strong>So if parents shouldn't leave their money to their kids - why do you think this is an all-consuming goal for many wealthy people, passing along the biggest nest to their children, if we can see what it does to siblings?</strong></p>\n<p>I don't know. Do you think that's a goal for a lot of people? I'm not sure it is.</p>\n<p><strong>I think it's still pretty big aspiration for many, making sure that your kids are better off than you were. But it's not necessarily doing that…</strong></p>\n<p>I think people want their kids to be better off than they were, but I think it's a very American assumption, or certainly it's a cultural assumption in this country, that kids will do better than their parents, but not because someone's given them money. I think that's more of a European concept, and I've been having interesting conversations with my German editor about this. Going back to how I grew up, I didn't know anyone who inherited money. I didn't know anyone whose family operated that way. And when I met people when I was much older where that dynamic was in place, it didn't always seem like a healthy one to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting a little bit into the news cycle here, do you think family inheritance has had any personality impact on any of the current presidential candidates?  Any point of view on that?</strong></p>\n<p>Pretty much anyone who's running for president has family money. I think that's one thing that attracted certain people to Obama's story, and Bill Clinton's story. They came from more humble financial backgrounds. But the way the political system is right now, it seems like you have to check off so many boxes, I'm not sure how you do it if you're just a scrabbling, ambitious, smart, hard-worker. But that's life: if you have a family who's able to open doors for you in all different kinds of ways, you have access to opportunities other people don't. It's unfair, but it's how things work.</p>\n<p><strong>Ellie Kemper is Book of the Month's Guest Judge and she selected your book.  What's your favorite Ellie Kemper role?  (She's been in <i>The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, The Office, Bridesmaids, The Mindy Project? </i>)</strong></p>\n<p>Well I love <i>Kimmy Schmidt</i>. I think it's the perfect Ellie role. She's so talented she can do anything. She has this very middle America, very innocent, open, sweet face. And I like that the Kimmy Schmidt character allows her to be that person, but also have this very dark streak running through. And that's a really, really hard thing to pull off, and she just does it perfectly.</p>\n<p><strong>Ellie has a unique sensibility and a dedicated group of fans, what three words would you use as an author to describe her?</strong></p>\n<p>Funny. Generous. Authentic. She is very genuine. What you see off the screen, in real life, is who she is.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you know her, personally?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes I do.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you know her?</strong></p>\n<p>I've known Ellie for years. My husband has worked with Conan O'Brien since 1995 and Ellie was an intern on the <i>Late Night</i> show. After that, she started performing in sketches and also started dating one of the writers—her now husband—and we became friends around that time.</p>\n<p><strong>Going back to <i>The Nest</i>. There's a lot of New York City themes: money, power, privilege. All taking place in the aftermath of 9/11 and the financial crisis. Do you think this book could have been set anywhere else?</strong></p>\n<p>No. Publishing is in New York, media is in New York. You could take this cast of characters and put them in a different city but a lot would have to change.</p>\n<p><strong>Where did you live when you were in New York?</strong></p>\n<p>I lived in many, many different neighborhoods. I lived in New York for over 25 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh wow. What was your favorite?</strong></p>\n<p>I loved Brooklyn. That's where we lived right before we moved out here. We lived in the West Village for a while and I loved the West Village. That was really special, that's where I lived when my kids were born.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you miss New York?</strong></p>\n<p>I do, I do, but I get back a lot.</p>\n<p><strong>So this is your first book, correct?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>What prompted you to become an author and to write a novel?</strong></p>\n<p>We had moved to LA. And my kids were older and I was trying to figure out what my next career move was going to be and I had always been a marketing, communications copywriter and I didn't want to do that anymore. I had always harbored a desire to write from a more personal place. When I was living in New York, I started writing some essays When we moved to Los Angeles, I decided to take some fiction classes and that led to me deciding to get my MFA from the Bennington Writing Seminar and that's where I started the book.</p>\n<p><strong>You said you were once a member of Book of the Month.</strong></p>\n<p>I was - my mom was always a member. When I first moved to New York City in my 20s, in the mid-1980s, I joined the Book of the Month Club and Columbia Records. I probably still have books in this house from then.</p>\n<p><strong>Awesome. So our members will choose from one of five books each month, yours will be one of them for April. What kind of readers will most enjoy <i>The Nest?</i></strong></p>\n<p>Anyone who likes reading about family relationships, anyone who likes books set in New York City. I think it would definitely appeal to people who like books that have humor but I wouldn't describe it as a comedy. The book has been described as darkly comic and I think that's probably pretty accurate.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks, Cynthia!</strong></p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited</i></p>\n","cover_img":"Nest_663x400.jpg","post_img":"Nest_663x400.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>April Guest Judge Ellie Kemper selected Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney's debut novel,<a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=111\"><i>'The Nest'</i></a> as her Book of the Month.

I apologize for the bird pun in the very first sentence of this review, but what can I say? I'm giddy. I could not put this book down. The Plumb family is a messed-up, dysfunctional, self-obsessed unit full of messed-up dysfunctional, self-obsessed members – much like your family or mine. What makes their journey a delight to read is the way that Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney seamlessly and artfully weaves their stories together. I've always been fascinated by the fact that an artist can induce pleasure from essentially unlikeable characters, and Ms. Sweeney does just that in this captivating story.</p>\n<p>&quot;The Nest&quot; refers to the Plumb siblings' shared trust fund, which they are due to receive on the youngest sibling's 40th birthday. As is often the case with oldest siblings (I myself am the second of four – incidentally, the second child is historically regarded as the &quot;dove-like&quot; child who can &quot;do no wrong&quot;), the eldest Plumb brother goes and gets himself into an accident mere months away from this long-awaited payday. The financial consequences from this event put the entire Nest in danger, and the remaining three siblings are left scrambling as this promised jackpot disappears before their eyes.</p>\n<p>As a result of counting on this trust fund for years, the Plumb children have remained as just that: children. Their arrested development has produced any number of irresponsible life choices; Jack and Melody insist on living beyond their means to keep up appearances, Bea remains stunted in a writing career that never quite blossomed, and Leo Plumb appears to live first, foremost, and solely for himself. What the author does so masterfully in this novel is to continuously rotate the points of view; each chapter is told through a different character's eyes. In this way, the story never takes a moment's rest.</p>\n<p>While reading this book, I involuntarily assigned the cast of <i>Mad Men</i> to play the various characters. I saw John Slattery as Leo, Vincent Kartheiser as Jack, Elisabeth Moss as Melody (we would have to age her a bit, but it could work). I think this is a comment on how easily the story dances in the reader's mind; it lives and breathes and is as immediate as a theater piece playing out before your eyes. I was sad to reach the last page. I hope that Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney writes another one, very soon.</p>\n","cover_img":"BOM_Mag_EllieKemper.gif","post_img":"BOM_Mag_EllieKemper.gif","author":"Book of the Month, Ellie Kemper","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>April Guest Judge Ellie Kemper selected Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney's debut novel, <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=111\"><i>The Nest</i></a> as her Book of the Month.

How did you piece together those details after the fact, given the state of shock that you were in?</strong></p>\n<p>I began journaling almost immediately. I'm somebody who has most of my life kept journals and diaries, and I needed to write just to process my own terrible feelings. The writing helped me, it was therapeutic for me. So I began writing very, very early on and tried to remember everything I could to get into my diary, and therefore it became a record later.</p>\n<p><strong>You shared a lot of memories of your son in your book that the world would not have otherwise known about. Can you share some other memories of your son with our readers?</strong></p>\n<p>We took so many out of the book, I'm trying to remember which ones we had. The memories I think that I remember most about Dylan were when he was perhaps kindergarten age. He was just so precocious, so bubbly, loving and so bright. The thing I just found endearing about him was how hard he worked at play. He was somebody who loved to challenge himself.</p>\n<p>Some of my favorite memories are when he was a youngster. For example, he was just barely three when I got him this number magnet set and he wanted to know what the plus sign and the minus sign and the equal sign meant. He was still wearing a diaper at night, so he was a little guy. And I remember showing him on the floor, I got pinto beans out, and I showed him what the plus sign meant: take this pile and take this pile and then put them together and count them again, and that was it for him. He understood addition that quickly. Then he did the same thing with subtraction. He started putting equations on the refrigerator with these magnets - 3 plus 3 equals, and he'd use the equal sign, and then he'd put the answer, and he was never wrong.</p>\n<p>That was what was so amazing about him. He had such an inquiring mind and he had such a curiosity about things and a love of wanting to master and understand. It was a joy as a mother, and having been a teacher as well, to watch this kid suck up everything he could get his hands on. He loved mazes, origami, and he learned to read very early. He started reading books silently to himself by the end of kindergarten. He was reading <i>Stuart Little</i> and <i>Charlotte's Web</i> sitting silently on the couch. Those are the things that I think I remember the most with such great pride because I was very proud of him. He was also a loving child and a playful child. He would wrestle with his brother and jump on the bed and do all the things that all other kids do. He was just a treasure.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you. Columbine occurred 17 years ago on April 20th. You said in your book that the grief became somewhat easier to manage about 7 years in. What is it like now after 17 years?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh boy. You know, I still have bad days. Especially on anniversary days - either birthdays, or the anniversary of the tragedy. What I find is, as I lead up to these dates, I start having a great feeling of - I don't know - discomfort, sadness, depression. Sometimes I don't even remember that it is the date, but I notice that I'm feeling horrible. So yes, even after all these years, I still have times when the pain and the sorrow are there. But I think after all of these years, I've tried to come to think of Dylan's death as something going wrong in his brain, and that whatever went wrong, was the thing that ended up ultimately taking his life and the lives of so many others. So it is like, in some ways, losing a child if he'd had some other kind of disease. For the most part now, I think that's the way it feels to me - that something went horribly wrong with Dylan, and because of what went wrong, he died as he did. I still lost him, but I think more about ill-health as being the cause rather than some kind of character flaw or evil within him.</p>\n<p><strong>How are your other family members doing. How are Tom and Byron?</strong></p>\n<p>You know I always try to head off that question because they'd both prefer to keep their lives private, so I try to avoid that question if I can. Byron and Tom - like so many other survivors I have met who have lost family members to murders and suicide - they don't want to be reminded of it, they don't want to dwell on it, they don't want to be associated with that terrible tragedy. They find it more comfortable to not talk about it or dwell on it. The fact that I do is sort of an unusual way to approach this. So I guess that's a long answer for saying: They're both doing OK.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you still in touch with any of the victims or family members of the victims, I know you had reached out to them after the tragedy?</strong></p>\n<p>You know we do occasionally interact with each other. It's too difficult for me, in most cases, to sustain a friendship, or an ongoing relationship. I think that might have been possible, but it was just a very difficult place for me to be in, psychologically, to maintain a closeness. But yes I am in touch with some of them, occasionally. Usually it's around some kind of an event, when maybe we want to let the other one know something is happening so that we can be prepared for it. I have had the opportunity to meet a couple more victims of the tragedy since the book came out.</p>\n<p><strong>The concept of &quot;brain health,&quot; and the need to destigmatize brain health are strong messages in your book. How do you think our society is doing with this today vs 17 years ago?</strong></p>\n<p>I believe that we have made a lot of progress in 17 years. For example, even the willingness to have a discussion about a murderer who then takes his own life, which is really experiencing a murder-suicide event, is a more recent phenomenon. I think there are still some people who are not able to acknowledge this discussion. But what I have seen is that so many people are ready and so many of us out there love people who have harmed themselves or harmed other people. And we really believe that something has malfunctioned, that this is not the person we knew, this is not the child that we raised., I see more and more that people are eager to understand., They are hungry for this discussion, of how brain  function interacts with behaviors of violence towards self or others. I think it's absolutely the right time to start talking about it.</p>\n<p><strong>I know that you're very involved in those efforts. Are you politically involved at all? Given that this is an election year, what President do you think would be the best advocate for brain health?</strong></p>\n<p>I don't have involvement at the national level at this moment. I'm connected with networks in the mental health and suicide prevention community, and when certain bills come up on mental health parity or perhaps, a Zero Suicide initiative that is right now being discussed in Colorado, I usually weigh in by notifying my elected officials, just to let them know my opinion and tell them why I support something or why I don't.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/MotherA_663x400.jpg\" alt=\"Book\" />\n<strong>In your book you say there were many signs of depression that Dylan displayed that you were not aware of at the time. What would you tell our readers, who may have friends or loved ones who are demonstrating similar behaviors, to do as a first step in approaching their friends and loved ones?</strong></p>\n<p>There is a wonderful training that I have taken, and I recommend it to people. It's called <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/cs/\">Mental Health First Aid</a>, and they have two versions of this training, one for adults, and one for children, for teens. I think the most important thing to do - and the course teaches this in greater detail - is if you see something that could indicate that someone is struggling, to express your concern and ask open-ended questions.  It's difficult sometimes to identify whether someone has behaviors that are indicative of something wrong, or whether it's just normal teenage behavior. (It's very difficult to tell the difference because, for example, with depression, someone can be moody, someone can be withdrawn, there could be a change in behavior, there could be sleep patterns that change. This could be also part of adolescence, so how do we know?) The way that we might begin to know this is if we ask. I think parents, all of us, have to do a better job of asking.</p>\n<p>The other thing that we have to do is be able to listen. Parents are so quick to try to fix what our children are experiencing when they're in pain. We try to comfort them, we try to say, if they think they're ugly, &quot;well I think you're pretty,&quot; or, &quot;you won't always feel this way,&quot; and &quot;adolescence is difficult.&quot; I think we have to do a much better job of hearing what our children have to say and forcing ourselves not to jump to try to fix it, but to just listen. I did speak with a psychiatrist that I had talked with in one of my interviews, and he had a wonderful quote that I'd like to share. He said, for any parent who has a moody teenager, I recommend that you ask <i>'What is something that no one in the world understands about you, that causes you pain?'</i> I thought that was a really good question. Then he said, let them finish answering, don't speak, just listen, and then say, tell me more about that.&quot; I thought that was very good advice.</p>\n<p>One of the things taught in Mental Health First Aid training is to listen without judgment, without trying to fix it, to validate what someone feels, and not try to talk them out of their feelings or tell them why they shouldn't feel that way. I recommend the training for everybody because you never know when you, yourself, or someone you love is going to have some kind of a mental health issue or condition. We need to know how to help someone in distress. There are too many people who suffer in silence because they don't know how to get help, they don't know what to do, they don't want to be stigmatized. This is a first step in trying to get some help.</p>\n<p><strong>Writing was an outlet for both you and Dylan. What kind of a role does writing play in your life today. You wrote this book. Are you still journaling?</strong></p>\n<p>I have stopped journaling for the most part, but I do an awful lot of correspondence, and emails, and I stay in touch with so many people that I know. I'm at my computer writing constantly. I'm not keeping these for my own records, I'm sending people emails, or I'm writing letters, and I'm really thinking, as you ask that question, that it's very important for me  to go back to journaling, and really make sure that I write for me, and continue to do that. I think it's a really necessary thing for me to do, and I think I need to do more of that.</p>\n<p><strong>We talk to a lot of avid readers who have said that reading has helped get them through very trying times. Are there any books that were particularly helpful to you over the past 17 years? Any fiction books that have helped you?</strong></p>\n<p>I read a lot of non-fiction. I read a lot about suicide loss, and a lot of suicide loss survivors find it very helpful to read about that. I guess that's called bibliotherapy. I read about things that I am interested in - art or yoga. As far as fiction goes, I don't read much fiction anymore. I used to read a lot of fiction. But I haven't read much really since Dylan died. I don't know why. That's an interesting point, I hadn't really thought about that. Mostly what I read is non-fiction.  I love biographies. I'm reading right now <i>No Ordinary Time</i> about Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt. Those are the kinds of things I really enjoy reading I think - biographies, more than anything else.</p>\n<p><strong>I always ask our authors - what type of readers do you think should read your book?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm going to answer that based on the feedback that I've gotten. I have had many people say  that I think every parent, especially a parent of teens, or tweens, should read your book. I really hope that parents will read this book because I don't want any parent to ever have to go through what I went through, and I don't want any parent to have to look back and realize that their child was suffering and they didn't see it, didn't know how to ask, didn't know what to do. That's a very difficult thing to live with. So I think more than anything I was writing for other parents. I was also writing to other survivors of loss because I think it is helpful for all of us who have lost loved ones or who struggle with loved ones who are experiencing hardship. I think it's helpful to know that other people get through these things and that we can get through them too.</p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited</i></p>\n","cover_img":"MotherB_663x400.jpg","post_img":"MotherB_663x400.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Sue Klebold","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>17 years ago on April 20th, 1999, teenagers in high schools around the United States and their frightened parents learned of the events taking place at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado.

April marks the real beginning of spring weather (aka reading-outside-in-the-sun weather) for most of the U.S. and we evaluate every title under consideration with the question, &quot;Does this pair well with a hammock and a side of lemonade?&quot;</p>\n<p>This month's selections all fit that bill to a T, despite all being very different in genre and subject matter. Guest Judge Ellie Kemper's choice, <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=111\"><i>The Nest</i></a>, is exactly the kind of book you want to devour under the sun; just don't forget your sunscreen because this story of a family in upheaval will make the hours fly by. The Plumbs are the kind of dysfunctional family you'll love to hate when the book opens. Fighting about the unauthorized draining of their trust fund (dubbed &quot;The Nest&quot;), they have quintessential #firstworldproblems. But Melody, Leo, Jack and Bea - and their individual families - are so likeably unlikeable that you can't help but want everything to work out for all of them.

Klebold approaches the shooting, as well as events preceding and following, with such empathy and heartbreak that I personally had a physical reaction while reading it. Though it doesn't appear on its face like a sunshine-y book, her message is ultimately one of hope. I am so excited that we get to bring it, along with an exclusive interview with Sue, to our members. It's an important and powerful book that I know you will all love. It's one I'm recommending to just about everyone I know.</p>\n<p>For you historical fiction and mystery lovers, <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=108\"><i>Flight of Dreams</i></a> is that hard-to-find gem that truly fits comfortably within both genres. With captivating details and a plot that's as fast-paced as any modern thriller, Ariel Lawhorn has written one of my favorite historical novels of the year. And it's only April! Set aboard the Hindenburg, Lawhorn posits one answer to the mystery of why that airship exploded. And in the process weaves an amazing web of character and language that will delight just about every kind of reader.</p>\n<p>If you're like me, there's nothing you like to read more on vacation than an edge-of-your-seat thriller, that kind of thriller that you're white knuckling until the very end.

Written under the pseudonym &quot;John Smith,&quot; the memoir by a CIA agent dropped into the middle of the war reveals a deeper side to this already-shadowy battle. Doug Laux, who just recently revealed his true identity, somehow manages to both answer questions and raise more at the same time, leaving open the possibility that this heavily redacted - and I do mean <i>heavily redacted</i> - and amped up narrative is only half the story.

Aside from playing with a puppy, reading in the sunshine is pretty much the most enjoyable activity you can do outside without the company of friends. It's easy to get lost for hours in a novel, sitting on a park bench or splayed out on a picnic blanket, acquainting yourself with fantastic new characters and their stories. It's one of the least guilty pleasures we can think of.</p>\n<p><strong>It's a Way to Take Advantage of Those Extra Hours of Sunlight</strong></p>\n<p>Now that daylight savings is here, there are extra hours of daylight. Yay! Make Benjamin Franklin proud and put those extra, sunlit hours to good use by reading. There's nothing quite like curling up by a window with your book, particularly during those days before it gets warm enough to stay outside in the evenings. So have a seat in your favorite reading nook, put on a kettle of tea or crack open that bottle of Pinot, and read by the light of the sun as the ground outside begins to thaw.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/FB_Spring2.jpg\" alt=\"Spring2\" /></p>\n<p><strong>What a Lineup!</strong></p>\n<p>The spring brings out some of the most anticipated books of the year.

It's an exciting experience for me that every month I am met with five new amazing authors, each with a tale to share!</p>\n<p>I had previously been looking to join a monthly book subscription for a while but never committed, primarily because I was afraid that I wouldn't like the book selections offered. So after a little (ok, a LOT) of digging, I was really pleased to discover that Book of the Month allowed you to choose from a specific selection, including one from a guest judge! It was also very apparent that each book chosen was not something randomly picked, but had a meaningful impact to each judge. Any reservations I once had with joining were now gone because it was so reassuring to see how much each judge wanted you to pick their selections!

I've always loved to read.  I have a very eclectic style - reading anything from history to scifi to classics.  Because I (for the most part) don't tend to read one specific genre or author, I often find myself stuck as to what book to read next.  Going to the bookstore is a bit daunting because there is so much to choose from.  I've also tried asking friends for selections without much luck.</p>\n<p>A year or so ago, I found out about subscription boxes.  I tried a few different book subscriptions, but the books were selected for you and if that book was a bust, well you just wasted your money.  Then last year I came across Book of the Month Club.  I had remembered it from the mailings my mother used to get when I was a kid. (I liked playing with the book choice stickers). After finding a coupon code (three months for $20 or so) I decided to give it a try, figuring it'd be like the others and I'd drop it after the trial.</p>\n<p>My first book was <i>Smaller and Smaller Circles</i>.  Wow!   It is a book I probably wouldn't have picked up in a store, but I loved it. Same with <i>Bohemian Gospel</i> - again, a book I wouldn't have picked up but it took my breath away.  Now I find myself looking forward to the first of the month to see what the selections are.  Each month there is at least one book that I want.

Of course you do! All three books blend history and fantasy and feature a leading lady that is so pissed off that the world can't help but bow down. Kelsea of the <i>Tearling</i> series is wonderful because, even though she's fighting evil to retake control of her kingdom, she's still a teenage girl in so many ways. While you're waiting for the third book in the <i>Tearling</i> series, coming in November, <i>Bohemian Gospel</i>'s Mouse is a fantastic companion and one of the most memorable protagonists we've featured in Book of the Month. <i>Jane Steele</i> is a reimagining of the classic <i>Jane Eyre</i> (think <i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</i>) that will change everything you think you know about that definitive text: &quot;Reader, I murdered him.&quot;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/IfYouLiked_WhenBreath.jpg\" alt=\"Breath\" />\n<strong>If you liked <i>Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End</i>, read February selection <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=102\"><i>When Breath Becomes Air</i></a> and look forward to <i>The Gene: An Intimate History</i> (May 17th).</strong></p>\n<p>Doctors are people too. In all three of these spectacular books, a physician tackles illness and mortality - whether it be his own, his patients', or the worlds' - in compelling and emotional fashion. If you're feeling very ambitious, read these books in this order - <i>Being Mortal, When Breath Becomes Air,</i> and <i>The Gene</i> - for an eye-opening insight into medicine and those that see it up close. Mukherjee's new book is a follow-up to his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of cancer, <i>The Emperor of All Maladies</i>, and is one of the most hotly anticipated nonfiction titles of the year.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/IfYouLiked_Whites.jpg\" alt=\"Whites\" />\n<strong>If you liked <i>The Night Gardener</i>, read July selection <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=67\"><i>The Whites</i></a> and look forward to <i>Dodgers</i> (April 5th).</strong></p>\n<p>Before he was a writer for TV's <i>The Wire</i>, George Pelecanos was a crime novelist. And before there was Pelecanos, there was Richard Price. If you've never read Richard Price, <i>The Whites</i> is a fantastic place to start. With a hard-bitten NYC detective at its center, Price redefines the genre every time he puts pen to paper. <i>The Whites</i> is Price at his finest, with an equal focus on character and plot, and Bill Beverly's debut coming-of-age crime novel takes its cues from these two masters of the category.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/IfYouLiked_Barbara.jpg\" alt=\"Barbara\" />\n<strong>If you liked <i>Bad Behavior</i>, read November selection <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=85\"><i>Barbara the Slut and Other People</i></a> and look forward to <i>Rich and Pretty</i> (June 7th).</strong></p>\n<p>Mary Gaitskill's fiction has long been a bastion of feminism, masked as young women behaving badly (hence the title of her most well-known novel), and Lauren Holmes' short story collection and Rumaan Alam's debut novel do Gaitskill's legacy proud. Learning to be adults in a changing world of feminism and womanhood, the main characters in each of these author's books are honest and authentic.

Bryan Stevenson's groundbreaking look at the state of the criminal justice system from his perspective as a young lawyer is a perfect companion to Jill Leovy's examination of a neighborhood and the police in the aftermath of a violent and tragic crime. Add to that Matthew Desmond's revealing study of poverty in a suffering city, and you'll be hard pressed to find a better picture of modern urban life when you're poor, disenfranchised and subject to the mercy of a system that doesn't see you.</p>\n<p><i>(Want any of these Book of the Month picks?

The books chosen in the BOTM Club are always a wide variety, and each month I have trouble whittling down my choices to just one! (I always end up adding on books.)

The Feel of a Book</strong></p>\n<p>Holding a hardcover book is a physical, tactile experience. And that elicits strong emotions. It was one of the first things our Guest Judge Whoopi Goldberg mentioned about her love of reading, &quot;You know I like the feel of a nice book... There's nothing like a good story. Put the phone down get in the bathroom. Take a minute. You can sit on the can and be on the moon at the same time.&quot;</p>\n<p>Bestselling Author and Book of the Month member Mitch Albom painted an even stronger picture of us - that moment when the book is delivered to your door.</p>\n<p>&quot;I remember getting a book shipped to the house. Getting a book, and seeing it arrive is a different feeling than anything else because it has a nice shape...And there's a way of like ripping it open and pulling it out and it first comes out and you see all those, maybe the deckle-edged pages or something.

The Smell of a Book</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to touch, the sense of smell is also strongly evoked with a hardcover book. Whether it's an old, musty book, or a fresh-off-the-press tome with crisp new pages, most readers can't help but hold that spine up to their noses and take a big whiff. Why do books smell so good?</p>\n<p>The Daily Mail recently published an <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2647333/Why-old-books-smell-good-Infographic-reveals-complex-chemistry-comforting-scent-yellowed-pages.html\">article</a> citing the research of a British chemistry teacher. They explain, &quot;Old books have a sweet smell with notes of vanilla flowers and almonds, caused by the breakdown of chemical compounds in the paper, while new books smell like they do because of chemicals used in their manufacture.&quot; These chemicals originate from the adhesive, ink, and the paper treatment methods used in the book. The chemist explains that, &quot;No single chemical causes the odour of books. It's a result of a complex mix of volatile chemicals produced by chemicals used in their manufacture, as well as the gradual degradation of the chemicals within the paper.&quot;</p>\n<p>Whatever the science may be, the smell of a book elicits feelings of nostalgia and comfort. It's something that an e-reader can't do, even with a <a href=\"http://smellofbooks.com/\">product</a> that claims to give devices that real book smell.</p>\n<p>...We'd rather just read a real book.</p>\n<p><strong>3.

There are plenty of online resources (including <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/\">Book of the Month</a>!), but there's something exciting about seeing what complete strangers are reading out and about in public. It's a part of our curious nature. One of the most entertaining ways to pass the time on public transit is to creep on other riders' books. Instagram account <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hotdudesreading/\">Hot Dudes Reading</a> has amassed over 800K followers by taking photos of attractive men reading physical books and papers. Whether you're checking out the person holding the book, or the book itself, a hardcover will give you much more intel than the back of an iPad or e-reader.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Hardcovers May Be Better For the Environment</strong></p>\n<p>Reading a hardcover may be better for the environment than consuming books on your e-reader. Depending on your book consumption, reading a physical book may be the best way to keep your carbon footprint to a minimum. The New York Times dug into this topic <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/04/04/opinion/04opchart.html?_r=0\">here</a>, with the following conclusion:</p>\n<p>&quot;With respect to fossil fuels, water use and mineral consumption, the impact of one e-reader payback equals roughly 40 to 50 books. When it comes to global warming, though, it's 100 books; with human health consequences, it's somewhere in between. All in all, the most ecologically virtuous way to read a book starts by walking to your local library.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>5. It's Easier to Comprehend What You're Reading with Physical Books</strong></p>\n<p>You may have suspected that what you read on the screen isn't absorbed in quite the same way as what you read from physical books. <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/reading-paper-screens/\">Research</a> shows that the absence of a tactile experience when reading from screens and e-readers &quot;prevents people from navigating long texts in an intuitive and satisfying way. In turn, such navigational difficulties may subtly inhibit reading comprehension.&quot; Other research shows that readers may approach reading from a screen in a way that is less conducive to learning, and that reading from a screen may also drain more of our mental resources and make it harder to remember what we read when we are done.</p>\n<br>\nWe hope this gives you enough reasons to curl up, read, and sniff a hardcover.

I know that you're from Morocco.</strong></p>\n<p>That's interesting. I mean I think that the sort of journey that my life has taken, which was not one I had expected has certainly played a big part in my writing. I had not expected, for example, to become an immigrant. I came to the United States to go to graduate school, and within a couple of years I had met someone and was married and [laughs], so you know life happened. I think that sort of crossing of borders has certainly been a central theme in a lot of what I'm writing. So for example, in my first book, <i>Hope and Other Dangerous Pursuits</i>, I write about a group of Moroccan immigrants who try to cross the Strait of Gibraltar on a lifeboat.</p>\n<p>It's not just physical crossing of boundaries that interests me, but I've also written about, sort of moving between cultures or between languages, and between milieux, that certainly was the case in my second book, <i>Secret Son</i>. And then with this one, which is a little bit different because it's a historical novel, you can kind of see that it's still dealing with the same issue of cross-cultural encounters, except that in this case it's set in 1528 and it's an epic story of conquest. What happens when a person from one culture is suddenly thrust into another, or what happens when two cultures meet, what are some of the consequences of that?</p>\n<p><strong>That brings me to a question that I had about something you had written in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/my-life-as-a-muslim-in-the-wests-gray-zone.html?_r=0\">New York Times</a> - you said &quot;I was born in one nation (Morocco) speaking Arabic, came to my love of literature through a second language (French) and now live in a third country (America), where I write books and teach classes in yet another language (English).&quot; Can you tell us more about those experiences of having multiple cultures, religions, and languages present in your life?</strong></p>\n<p>I think, to me it's not that unusual of an experience. I think nowadays we live increasingly in an age of globalization and I think that kind of experience is more common than people imagine. So I was born in Rabat, Morocco, and I grew up in a house full of books. I grew up around people who loved to read, my parents were big readers, and so I read from a very young age and I started to have the urge to tell stories from a young age, but at home we spoke obviously Moroccan-Arabic, but my parents sent me to a French school when I was a little girl, and so my earliest exposure to literature came through French. So I read a lot of French books and French literature later on. There certainly is a huge Moroccan literature in French - a number of Moroccan writers - writing in French. So I read a lot of my own culture through French. Then later on in college I majored in English and then I ended up studying in England and later in the United States, and decided, because I was already writing so much of my research, for my dissertation, in English, decided to try my hand at writing non-fiction, and then later fiction, in English.</p>\n<p>So that kind of a journey through languages is featured again in my work. This is what I mean when I say that I'm always writing about crossing boundaries. I've always found it to be very enriching, I've always found it to be something that has added great value to my life to have been able to live across different cultures. When I see a lot of what's happening in the country right now, a lot of this divisive rhetoric, that's being spouted by a number of presidential candidates, it's just very, very concerning, because I don't fear others. I see myself in other people, I don't necessarily fear them and I feel like a lot of the divisive rhetoric is based on fear.</p>\n<p><strong>Going more into <i>Moor's Account</i>, what specifically appealed to you about writing this account from what was thought of as one of the first black explorers of America?</strong></p>\n<p>It's such a fascinating story. I was reading a book about Moorish Saints years ago and I came across a very brief mention of a man named Estebanico who was said to be the first black explorer of America. He was said to be a Moroccan slave who had been part of the Narvaez expedition. When I came across that, I said, &quot;Wait a minute, what do you mean first black explorer of America?&quot; It just seemed such an incredible story and I had never even heard about it. So I decided to read up more on the chronicles of the Narvaez expedition. That's how I found Cabeza de Vaca's account.</p>\n<p>The Narvaez expedition, it's such an incredible, epic story. It's a story of conquest, it's a story of ambition and greed. Narvaez, this fascinating character in his own right, left Spain with 600 men, women, and children, nearly 100 horses. Landed in Florida in 1528 with the goal of claiming it for the Spanish crown, but within a year, there were only four survivors, for a variety of reasons, because the expedition just basically met with every imaginable disaster. Within a year there will only four survivors - Cabeza de Vaca, the treasurer of the expedition, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, who's a young nobleman, Andres Dorantes de Carranza, who's another nobleman, and his Moroccan slave, a man that the other three Spaniards called Estebanico. We don't actually know what his real name was. And together they journeyed across North America. When they were found many years later and brought to Mexico City and asked about their experiences, the testimony that was collected was collected only from the three nobleman but not from the slave because it was assumed that his testimony was not valuable or superfluous or uninteresting, in spite of the fact that he had learned indigenous languages and served as a translator for the others, often times also as a scout, and had been alongside them the whole time.</p>\n<p>That historical erasure seemed to me to be interesting because it also felt very modern, it's something that I still see, that I think is ongoing. It is part of history that certain perspectives are going to be recorded and valued and other perspectives are not going to be recorded or not going to be valued and are going to be erased. So that appealed to me, this idea that he had this incredible life and nobody remembered it. And I thought, wouldn't it be interesting to hear about this expedition from the point of view from the one member of the expedition whose destiny was never collected.</p>\n<p><strong>What was the process like, writing historical fiction?</strong></p>\n<p>Well it was, actually to be honest, it was a little bit terrifying, because I hadn't written - my work up to that date had been contemporary. I hadn't written a historical novel before, so I was a little bit afraid of all the research that it would involve. It certainly was a very, very long process, the research, but I feel like I've been very fortunate in the sense that the Narvaez expedition has been the subject of intense interest on the part of historians and anthropologists. So there's a lot of material about it, obviously about Cabeza de Vaca's account, and various translations of it, but also commentaries that were made about it, discussions that existed in academic literature. So I was able to read up on it - find maps, find additional documents, read up more about what Narvaez had been like before he decided to go on this journey. I read also a lot about Spanish exploration of the Americas in the 16th Century. I also read extensively about Moroccan politics in the 16th Century, like the specific circumstances that might have led someone like Estebanico to end up on a Spanish expedition.</p>\n<p>Of course I also read up a lot on indigenous tribes in what is now the United States and tried to find as much information as I could about them. A number of these tribes are now extinct and so we often have only Spanish sources about them. Later on, we also have other sources that can be relied upon for research. So it was a long process of research but at the end of the day research can only take you so far and you have, in writing fiction, obviously you have to create characters, you have to create a story, you have to create themes, and that really is the challenge, is that you have to create these characters but you're operating within the constraints of history. You know that they're going to leave Spain at a specific date and they're going end up in Mexico City at a specific date, and that certain circumstances are going to compel them to act in certain ways. The rest of it is up to you, the rest of it in creating these characters, is up to you as an author. That process I found very enjoyable. I really had a lot of fun writing the book.</p>\n<p><strong>Great. I wanted to ask, what are some of your favorite books - whether fiction or nonfiction?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh dear me. You know I always have such a hard time answering that only because there's so much to pick from. I'm a great admirer of John Coetzee, the South African writer, I guess now Australian writer. So I went back to him a lot during the writing of this book. I also love V.S. Naipaul, I like Margaret Atwood, Toni Morrison has been a huge influence on me. For this book I read a lot of historical fiction, so I read a lot of Amitav Ghosh.\nAnother big influence on the book has been travel-logs. So I read the Moroccan explorer Ibn Battuta. I read some of his work to prepare for the Moor's Account.</p>\n<p><strong>What books do you read to your daughter?</strong></p>\n<p>Well I am a little bit unusual in that I've tried to read some of my serious works to her but - so for example last year together we read <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> and <i>Tom Sawyer</i>, she loved those, such great fun to read those. But we also read things like <i>Animal Farm</i>, [LAUGHS], <i>The Metamorphosis</i>, I love Kafka and I thought that was probably the more accessible of his books. She's a little bit older now so of course we did all of the <i>Harry Potter</i>, all of the Philip Pullman, all that stuff we did a long time ago, so we're kind of transitioning to semi-serious stuff now. Another book she loved was  <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>.</p>\n<p><strong>So how does it feel that your book was selected by Craig Ferguson, obviously you've gotten a lot of acclaim for this book, but specifically Craig Ferguson who is a historian himself?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, yeah it's weird when you publish a book you never really know what to expect - whether it's going to find readers. He just came across the book like any other reader. At the bookstore, read it, loved it, had me on his show back when he had his TV show but it didn't quite work out because the segment before mine went a little longer so my segment didn't run. So I think he's been such a great supporter of the book and has mentioned it in interviews. So it's just been delightful to see that he's a fan of it.</p>\n<p><strong>What are you reading right now?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, [LAUGHS]. I am judging two literary prizes, so I'm afraid I'm reading a lot of manuscripts. I'm judging the PEN/Bellwether Prize and I'm just finishing up with that and I'm going to be judging the Hurston/Wright Legacy Prize for Debut Fiction so I just have a whole box of books that have been submitted.</p>\n<p><strong>And what are you working on now?</strong></p>\n<p>Well I'm working on a novel, and it's actually part of a larger project. I'm kind of hesitant to discuss much about it. What can I tell you? It has to do with two generations of a family, across two different countries. How 'bout that.</p>\n<p><strong>Great. Anything else you want our Book of the Month members to know as they're reading through this content to see what book they want to select for the month?</strong></p>\n<p>I hope that they enjoy reading the book and I hope that it leads to discussions about how history is recorded and the line between fact and fiction and whether it's as hard and fast as we usually like it to be, or believe it to be.</p>\n","cover_img":"663x400_Lalami.jpg","post_img":"663x400_Lalami.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Laila Lalami","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p>March Guest Judge Craig Ferguson's selection, <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=103\">'The Moor's Account'</a> tells the story of the the first black explorer of America, a Moroccan slave called Estebanico whose testimony was never recorded.

For the most part. There were some very exciting trips that I took to research the novel. I think probably one of most exciting was a last minute trip to Paris, to see the gowns of the Empress Eugenie, that were being displayed at the Fashion Museum of Paris, as well as out at Compiegne which is now a museum dedicated to the Empress Eugenie.</p>\n<p>So I found a $215 round trip ticket on Air India and dashed off to Paris to take advantage of this opportunity because it wasn't the sort of show that was going to be around for a very long time and that was a wonderful and fantastic opportunity. I'm really always so pleased when I look back that I took advantage of it. A lot of the research was things like going into the special collections at the University of Rochester and discovering the autobiography of a British Governess who had worked in the Tuileries Palace during the Second Empire, taking care of the Duke and Duchess de Tascher and who just dished, a lot of dish, on the Empress [laughs]. Or the letters of the Soprano Lily [Multan], she was an American soprano living in Paris, married to a British lord, and who had the affection of the Emperor and Empress. They had seen her skating in the Bois de Boulogne and they were so impressed - they were trying to skate themselves, trying to learn to skate. They asked her if she would teach them, which I think is a completely adorable story [laughs]. So these kinds of things were also as thrilling to me but they didn't involve glamorous travel and looking at beautiful gowns in quite the same way.</p>\n<p><strong>I was going to ask you, about the focus on the costumes and the gowns, there's so much attention to detail there. I wanted to ask you - if the 'Queen of the Night' were to be turned into a movie, is there a designer who you would trust to bring those costumes to life?</strong></p>\n<p>There's a number of designers who would be fantastic to do it. But the one I hope is interested is Prabal Gurung. A friend of mine gave him and a member of his design team signed copies of the novel, and they invited me to his show in New York during Fashion Week. It was a thrill to be able to shake his hand and tell him I'm a fan. So I'm hoping the novel inspires him. Thinking in the biggest possible terms... [laughs] My fantasy would be if the novel was chosen as the theme for the Met Gala by Anna Wintour, that would be the supreme situation. Many designers working on the vision, as a grand ball, well, that would be incredible.</p>\n<p><strong>Maybe we'll plant the seeds here.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Our Guest Judge for March is Craig Ferguson and he chose a historical fiction book, 'The Moor's Account,' and so he talked a lot to us about historical fiction and this idea, is it really fiction though? We don't know? It could have happened, it was very well-researched. So you've talked about this before, is 'Queen of the Night' historical fiction?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Most definitely it is. But with a twist.</p>\n<p>I loved 'The Moor's Account.&quot; That's my friend Laila Lalami's novel, it's fantastic. I would say she and I did different but similar projects. We both wove our stories into the existing history as a way to illuminate and argue with that history. I think in my case the big difference is that mine is also posing this question: what if someone who was alive at that time had this kind of extraordinary uncanny existence but in secret? It's a novel about an opera singer who believes she may be one of those people chosen by the gods to be made an example out of, in order to be known forever for her hubris--cursed to repeat the fates of the characters she performs, and so the plots of the operas that she is performing in are taking over her life. And that was really fun to play with, to try to take opera plots, which are so over-the-top, and to imagine, &quot;What if that plot was your real life? What would that be like?&quot; That was what I was trying to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you have those pre-plotted out the different roles that she would take - that she would be a circus performer, and in the opera, or how did those roles take their shape?</strong></p>\n<p>I did not have the story pre-plotted, not at all. Lilliet as she is at the end was the first vision I had of her: An opera singer traveling with the circus, on a train at night, sneaking off to hang out with the elephants in the elephant car, and full of secrets. She has just retired from performing in Europe and is beginning a new life in America, and isn't really explaining herself to anyone. From there I kept asking questions like, where did you come from? Where did you go to school? Where did you learn to be a singer? The questions led to answers and the answers led to this plot and to the twists and turns.</p>\n<p><strong>What intrigues you about singers and choirs, that's something you've written about before?</strong></p>\n<p>As a human experience, being touched by music, being able to touch other people through your music, through your voice in particular, there's really not anything like it. There's no analogous relationship. And that's what's so potent about it, to me. The way in which a song can instantly transform your mood, the way in which it can take you, transport you...those are incredible things to think about. And then also when you are singing, the way in which you are in a communion with something bigger than yourself, that is also something that comes from yourself, at the same time--that also is entirely unique and I think, spiritual and beautiful.</p>\n<p><strong>You said in an article that you ask your fiction writing students, 'what are the implications of what you've invented?' So what are the implications for <i>Queen of the Night</i> and for this character that you've invented?</strong></p>\n<p>When I tell my writing students this it's usually because they have come to me with a scene but no plot. Much in the way that I describe that scene that I began my own novel with. And that's what I mean by the implications. For example: I had a student who was writing a vampire novel, and the vampire was a real clothes horse, and I said to her, 'Well, if she's been alive for 800 years and she loves clothes, she has an incredible closet.' [Laughs] That would be such an incredible invention to pursue, you know and that was a missed opportunity for her as a young writer. She saw this and went back to it.</p>\n<p>For myself, with this book, I kept thinking about all the ways in which someone like Lilliet would have had to struggle and the incredible challenges she had to face. I think it's very hard for people to imagine how bad things were for women back then. I know that I've dramatized it in this very stylized way for the novel--this is not realism--but I was trying to include those very real challenges in a way that honored them. And I hope that was successful. So when I say, what are the implications of what you've invented, I'm really talking about that drafting process.</p>\n<p>In terms of the implications of what I've invented now that it is done and out in the world, I suppose I'm still finding out, but I think what I have learned is how much readers really, really want to just be completely absorbed in a story--a story that takes this world away and replaces it with another one. That all these things that I feared might be off-putting, the foreignness of it, the levels of detail and description, the curse, that that is all actually exactly what they want. That's a tremendous lesson for me as a writer. I don't know what I'll do with it, but I'm paying attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Switching gears a little bit here, can I ask your reaction to being selected as a Book of the Month author? And is there anything you want our readers to get from <i>Queen of the Night</i>?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm thrilled, it's an honor, it's an august institution Book of the Month Club, and I couldn't be happier about it. And I think in terms of what I would want readers to get from it, I just hope they experience it as just a ripping, good yarn. [Laughs] Just an adventure, you know just to go into the fun of it and see what else they find in the process, because there was a way in which I just wanted it to be, at one level, an adventure novel, within the world of opera at that time.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your plans now? What are you working on?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm currently at work on a collection of essays, and thinking about what's going to be my next novel. I have four different ideas for what the next book could be. And I have different pages for all of them, and I'm just kind of pushing them around and looking to see which one's going to be the one I'm most interested in.</p>\n<p><strong>Then I have a question from Liberty Hardy who chose your book. She wants you to talk about the Scarlet Professor project.</strong></p>\n<p>The Scarlet Professor is a screen adaptation of a biography by Barry Werth that I'm writing with my partner Dustin Schell. It's a biography of a professor by the name of Newton Arvin who was a literary critic in the early 20th Century, one of a group of literary critics who were creating our sense of what American literature is now. He was a gay man, the first important lover of Truman Capote and also something of a mentor to him.  He wrote important, early books on Hawthorne, Melville, Whitman, and Longfellow. So we owe him a great debt and an even greater one in a sense because of what happened to him in 1960 when he was the subject of a sting, coordinated by the FBI, the police and Postmaster General. His mail was being opened, without his knowledge, a common practice at the time, and they were looking for what they considered to be obscene materials. He was arrested as a pornography trafficker. Simply for owning a few pieces of erotica, and a few pieces of pornography, and then some classical Greek images. He was internationally humiliated by the police at the time as a part of their attempt to root out &quot;perverts.&quot; His life and the lives of 17 other men were destroyed.

Eight years prior, as medical students, we'd slept similarly ensconced in a twin bed next to my grandfather as he lay dying at home, having cut our honeymoon short to help with caregiving duties. We awakened every few hours to give him medications, my love for Paul deepening as I watched him lean in and listen closely to my grandfather's whispered requests. We'd never have imagined this scene, Paul's own deathbed, so near in our future. Twenty-two months ago, we'd cried in a bed on another floor of this same hospital as we learned of Paul's cancer diagnosis. Eight months ago, we'd been together here in my hospital bed the day after Cady was born, both napping, the first good, long sleep I'd had since her birth, wrapped in each other's arms. I thought of our cozy bed empty at home, remembered falling in love in New Haven twelve years earlier, surprised right away by how well our bodies and limbs fit together, and thought of how ever since, we'd both slept best when entwined.

Behind us, the police cruiser was at the far edge of the parking lot, presumably trying to look inconspicuous.  <br>\n&quot;If Leigh is the love of your life, Paul,&quot; I asked quietly, &quot;why'd you let her go off on her own? Why didn't you come after her?&quot;  <br>\n&quot;I've been asking myself that question for a long time,&quot; he said. &quot;But you know what, Rocky? You can't change the past.

Reading was hugely important. We belonged to that - they were fine with that. I could pick out any books that I wanted. I remember getting a book shipped to the house. Getting a book, and seeing it arrive is a different feeling than anything else because it has a nice shape. You know what it is when it gets there. It comes in that box, you know, that's kind of set for it. And there's a way of like ripping it open and pulling it out and it first comes out and you see all those, maybe the deckle-edged pages or something. You're holding it in your hands for the first time, you're flipping through it. So tactile you know. That's what I try to tell my young family members, who are in their teens or 20's and read...one of my nephews read 'Frankie Presto,' 500 plus pages, on his phone. A cell phone. And told me, 'Oh it was great.' I said, 'How could you even absorb it on your cell phone?' So yeah I remember the days of books coming in the mail, for us, and ripping them open, and that was a big deal.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KEosviQS6Bw?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>We also asked Mitch what he's currently working on.</strong></p>\n<p>What am I working on...

Yeah, so the last six years since the earthquake. Which has really opened my eyes to children and what it means to be a family, even if you know, they don't look like you, and you're the wrong age, and all these other things. Kids in Haiti have really opened up my eyes. So there's a lot of stories that I've collected, and there's one in particular that I'm going to focus on. And I think we'll do that in 2017.

Albom, who is best known for his memoir 'Tuesdays with Morrie,' tried to make it as a musician before becoming a writer. 'Frankie Presto' is narrated in the voice of music and tells the story of the world's greatest guitarist, weaving in real artists, like Elvis Presley and Duke Ellington, who Frankie encounters throughout his life. In a one-on-one with Mitch at ABC Radio, where he broadcasts his nationally syndicated show, he told BOTM: &quot;So it was really failure that led to writing, not anything more glamorous than that.&quot;</p>\n<p>Watch the interview or read the transcript below:</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hU7gUK_6ksg?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Why did you decide to write a non-fiction book centering around music?</strong></p>\n<p>Before I ever wrote anything I was a musician and some people know that - most people don't. It's always been a love of mine. I sort of stopped playing music and trying to make it as a musical artist when I started writing so I think in my head I never mixed the two, because one sort of begat the other you know I didn't really start writing until I gave up music. But at this age, I was able to come up with something that I wanted to say about talent. And the way that every talent that everybody has - and everybody has one, at least, affects other people. I realized, well the talent that I probably know the best, maybe people who read me think it would be writing, but it isn't, it's music. So I said the time's probably come to set a book back in the world that I actually know better than anything else, even sports, and use that to tell the story about how the talents we have affect everybody in a different way and really changed the world around us.</p>\n<p>I'd like to say that there was some sort of divine calling to writing that swept me away from music, but the far less glamorous truth is that I flopped in music. I couldn't get a record deal, I couldn't advance the way that I wanted to, and I was starting to see - I lived in New York and you know, just did the starving artist thing, held every kind of odd job while I worked at night singing or playing or writing songs or bringing them to record companies, having them try to - &quot;please buy my song, please buy my record,&quot; &quot;no, no, no, no.&quot; People didn't even really listen to what it was, and I think one day I was auditioning some guys for a band that I was putting together, and I was only 23 or 24, and guys were coming in who were 50 years old to audition for the band that I was putting together. I sort of realized - &quot;Wow this can go on forever. I mean, there's no end to this.&quot;</p>\n<p>I started writing when I started volunteering for a local newspaper where I lived. They gave it away for free. I picked it up one day, there was an ad that said 'If you have some free time we could use some people helping us with the newspaper.' So I had some free time, I went down there, I was the youngest person there by about a hundred years, and they gave me an assignment that day to write about parking meters. And I went out and covered it as if it was Watergate. Never wrote anything before really, but I think I had some innate writing ability and certainly music helped me know how to create phrases and ideas. When the paper came out the next week I picked it up in the supermarket and my story was on the bottom of the front page - which shows you how little news actually happened that week - but also it was my first byline. I saw my name, and you get like goose bumps even when you tell the story about wow you know I could make words and put them together and they come out in this printed thing, and it's mine forever.  And I think I became a writer that day, and that was it. So it was really failure that led to writing, not anything more glamorous than that.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJEiAPxW40o?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Is Frankie Presto based on anyone?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm glad you asked me is Frankie Presto based on anyone and not, 'Is Frankie Presto based on you?' Because people have asked me that and I've said 'Well let's see, he's stunningly handsome, has endless music talent, can sing, can play, so there's absolutely no connection to him from me at all, thanks for rubbing it in.' But I would say...there's a little Elvis in there, there's a little of this 19th century guitar player Francisco Taregga, who ends up sort of becoming kind of a guardian angel type for him. Frankie is born in Spain in the same town and the same church where Francisco Taregga was.</p>\n<p>There's something to me about the spirit of an artist living on, because if you think about art - music in particular - there are no musicians that just come out of the blue. They all listened to somebody before them. Even the most distant musician in some far away tribe in some far away country - the young artist has to listen to the elder. Certainly everybody who listened to jazz and rhythm and blues got into rock roll, everyone who listened to early rock and roll got into later or psychedelic rock and roll, everyone who listened to that stuff got into disco and punk. So I thought well Taregga, he was sort of the father of modern guitar in Spain. Modern classical guitar. He had trouble with his eyes and he was a bit of an outcast early on, like Frankie is, and he's from Spain, and he loves the guitar. So there's a little of him, there's a little Elvis, in that he was sort of fated to become this real big thing and then kind of regrets becoming a big thing, which I kind of think Elvis did. Then just little bits and pieces that I've heard from musicians along the way.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D2ZTQuGrhwk?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Going back to that concept of musicians who die - their talent being passed on. Do you think the same can be said of writing?</strong></p>\n<p>In the book, music tells a story, music is the narrator. That was the most fun and most challenging thing I've ever had to do in writing because when you decide to write a book that ends up being 500 pages, and the narrator is not a person, it's just a thing, it's a talent - music speaking as music. It's a challenge. It's also fun because you get out of the human set of parameters. So music explains that when you're born, you come into the world, human beings, before they even open their eyes, they can actually see. And what they see is a wall of colors, really bright colors. And those colors are actually all the talents in the human spectrum, and when we clasp our hands for the first times when we're babies which is of course the first thing we do when we come out, we're actually seeing that wall of colors and grabbing the colors that appeal to us instinctively and those become our god given talents. So why you may be good at singing and someone else is good at dancing and someone else is good at math. And you say, 'How did the kid get good at that?' Well because you grabbed it, when you were younger.</p>\n<p>I like that metaphor because someone, some way, we all end up born with a certain ability to do something better than most people can do it. I do think that if you exercise that over the course of your life, if you line up with the color and the talent that you were meant to have, that was in your hands when you clenched it, you will create something that will live on beyond you, and will therefore affect somebody else that absorbs it, or reads it, or listens to it, or whatever. It's most certainly true in music, but it's proven true in writing. Go to any library and take out a book from somebody who's dead. He's doing it. His talent is going on because you're reading his words, you're hearing a voice from two centuries ago, three centuries ago, and it's still going on. That's very much the concept, it's easier even in a book, because books we have from that long ago, whereas music we only have from the time it was recorded which is relatively new.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ULH6pPyWZsQ?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Hoda was very interested in the real life musicians who were mentioned in your book. She talked to Darlene Love backstage about being used in your book. Can you talk about your relationship with some of these amazing musicians?</strong></p>\n<p>So I had the idea that because music was going to narrate the book, and Frankie Presto was going to be this sort of larger-than-life figure, that it was starting to get almost as if it was taking place in a non-real universe and if I took music and I took this superstar singer and then I made up bands and made up music and made up eras, the whole thing would just seem like it was taking place on mars. So I decided to ground it by making Frankie surreal, but all the other musicians in the book real. Not just the ones that are featured, but everybody he plays with along the way, is real. Everything in the book is historically accurate in terms of when he would have toured with Duke Ellington, when he hung around with his band, they were out on tour during that time. When he met Elvis Presley and played in his band on the Louisiana Hayride, that was accurate. When he met Hank Williams, and sold him the car that Hank Williams ended up dying in, that was accurate.</p>\n<p>So then I got the idea, well it's a funeral. That's where it starts. Wouldn't it be interesting to see how people spoke about him at the funeral, but I'm not going to make up people for the most part, I'm going to see if I can get real people to let me use their voices. Many of the people in the book I knew before the book started. I've been very blessed to have met a lot of people in the music world, I think because of my background in music, my interest in music, and the fact that I am no threat to anybody. Because I never met any of these people when I was in the music business. It was only as I got into the writing business that everybody wanted to meet me in the music business and vice versa. So Burt Bacharach, Tony Bennett, John Pizzarelli, Wynton Marsalis, Darlene, Roger Mcguinn, a number of these other guys, and women, I had a chance to know. I called them up and said listen, I have an idea, I want you to have met my character. Maybe you fell in love with him, maybe you influenced him, maybe you saved him, maybe you discovered him when he was down and out, I don't know. I'm not sure what you're gonna do, but would you trust me enough that I'll write something in your voice - I know how you speak, I've been around you, and I'll send it to you, if you don't approve it, fine no problem. But if you do I'd like you to be part of his life. To a person they all said yes and to a person they all approved it. It was really something, that everybody did.</p>\n<p>Darlene, she gets one of the best ones because she meets him early in life when she's 18 years old. Something that I found out from both talking to her and reading her autobiography about where she was when she was 18, and she did a concert at the Hollywood Bowl with Nat King Cole, so I took Frankie and I put him at that concert, everything else about it is real. When I saw Darlene she said, &quot;How did you know about Nat and that?&quot; And I said 'Darlene, you wrote a book -  you told me, you basically told the whole world.' She falls in love with him, and then he just sort of takes off. They have one night together, and that's it. But he says to her, 'Don't give up on music. You have a voice.' And she says, 'How can you tell I have a voice, I was singing with a bunch of other women?' And he said, 'I can always hear the one that stands out.' He gives her the encouragement to go in music. She goes home that night after she meets him, and writes in her diary, 'Today I met the boy I'm gonna marry.' Which of course became a hit song for her several years later. And in the book she says when I saw they gave me that song, 'Today I met the boy I'm gonna marry,' she said, 'Oh well this is my song because I wrote that sentence about Frankie Presto.'</p>\n<p>So the truth and the fiction interweave, and I did that with all of them. They were all tickled by it, I have to say. They were great. They got into it. They made videos about it. Some of them recorded songs about it. So there's a cross-section, there's something to be learned from, how much admiration artists have across different arts. Maybe even more than within their own. Within their own there's always a bit of jealousy, and a bit of... well if he's that good then what does that make me? But if it's a different field than yours, you can admire it without reservation, and you can just say ,'Oh that guy's a genius filmmaker or a genius dancer, or whatever.' And I was really fortunate to get cooperation from those artists.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sonkXoHqSqs?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>How does it feel that our Guest Judge Hoda Kotb selected your book for Book of the Month?</strong></p>\n<p>I owe her a big thanks when I see her again.

It's a small town in central Virginia, kind of best known as being the home of Jerry Falwell's Old Time Gospel Hour. I always joke around with people because most people when they think of Lynchburg, they think of Lynchburg, Tennessee, which is the home of the Jack Daniels Distillery, and I always say no, no, not Lynchburg, Tennessee - Jerry Falwell, not Jack Daniels. Big difference. I didn't really grow up in that world. I grew up across town, in the land of the sinners and the hypocrites, which we referred to as Episcopalians and Presbyterians. I always just was drawn to storytelling from a pretty young age. I think around the time I was a junior or senior in high school, I started thinking about writing more seriously as a pursuit, I had a really profoundly influential English teacher my senior year named Patty Worthem and she was a really wonderful mentor to me and turned me on not only to Shakespeare and Yates and all the classics that have really been a source of inspiration to me for many years but also was the first person that really encouraged me to read a lot of contemporary fiction and so she got me in particular interested in John Irving who has been a huge influence on me as well as Tim O'Brien and certain other really good contemporary writers that I like a lot. So that really was a huge influence for me. Then the other thing that I had happen when I was a junior and senior in high school was that I was involved in acting, in the theater group at our high school. We had a very influential and ambitious director, by the name of Jim Ackley, and he really pushed us</p>\n<p>He got this idea when we were seniors to write a play and perform it and I got the first experience of writing something that was - not published exactly - but delivered to an audience and I just got a real charge out of that and it was a lot of fun and I felt like man you know I can do this. I started pursuing that throughout college and then eventually decided I would probably want to go to graduate school, but my path took a lot of circuits. Family situations, and the general challenges that I think every writer faces who is not just born ready at early adulthood to go out there and set the world on fire. I meandered for a while, and was in and out of grad school, I wasn't sure really whether I wanted to go to creative writing grad school or try to get a doctorate and try to be a Professor first. Eventually I did wind up down at Florida State Graduate Creative Writing Program where I came under the influence of some really important mentors and teachers in particular Bob Shacochis whose last novel called 'The Woman Who Lost Her Soul' was a finalist for the Pulitzer I think last year or two years ago. And Elizabeth Stuckey-French, a really great contemporary writer, her last book is called 'The Revenge of the Radioactive Lady,' it's really good. And so I started there and learned a lot from those two teachers in particular and I wrote another novel that was very long, it was kind of more of a Shacochis-type novel which was dealing with sort of global politics and crime, and it was much more of a kind of serious Robert Stone, Cormac McCarthy type novel. That was the type of writer I thought I was supposed to be.</p>\n<p>Along the way I got married and my wife got married and I decided that I better grow up and support my family in a meaningful way and I hadn't finished my degree yet there so I said alright I'm going to get a job teaching at an independent school which I had done before and was comfortable with. Then I finished that book when I was teaching high school and I thought oh well I'll just do this for a few years until I finish that book and then the world will be ready to recognize my genius. Well that book did not sell - it came close in a couple of places. I still think it's a good book, clearly there was something about it that just didn't make somebody fall in love with it with is really what has to happen in the publishing process. You have to have an editor that absolutely loves your book and is willing to fight for it. So I kind of realized at that point that my life had changed, I'd become kind of a tamer person, I don't really have the type of lifestyle that I had had when I was younger. Now my life revolves around my children, and my wife, and is so much more domestic, ostensibly small concerns. So I realized that I wasn't going to have the luxury of writing a big, global type book again, because I didn't have the room to go off and discover those things, the way I had when I started the first book. I realized I had to turn back to memory, and go back in my childhood and find the events and the inspirations that made me feel like I had an urge to tell stories in the first place. So I rewound into some issues in my past, some problems with my family from when I was really young, and kind of learned about these things when I was older, and just didn't realize that there was a lot of hardship going on around me while I was just a happy-go-lucky kid, thinking I had the perfect family. So that was kind of the main theme for me when I went into the writing of 'Only Love Can Break Your Heart.' Trying to duplicate that feeling of disillusionment where you lose that innocence and your understanding of the way the world is around you and discover that it's a crueler, harsher place and that the people that you love are maybe wrestling some demons that are very powerful.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Post51_EdTark1.jpg\" alt=\"EdTark1\" /></p>\n<p><strong>You answered a couple of my questions from Liberty. Is John Irving one of your influences?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Who else?</strong></p>\n<p>I would say probably at this point obviously John Irving is a huge influence. I haven't really thought about it consciously but it's come to me a little bit lately in the last few months because I've been getting some comparisons to Pat Conroy and I really did - when I was in high school, I just devoured Pat Conroy's books and just thought he was amazing. As I got older, I sort of forgot about that and left it behind but there's no question that his sense of the importance of family and also his sense of place and love of language has filtered into me. Walker Percy is a huge influence to me, really not just as writer, but as a person, as a thinker. I identify with the struggle that is kind of the central theme of his writing and trying to wrestle with the problems of meaning and faith in the modern, fallen world and so I kind of think of him as a spiritual influence as well as a writing influence.</p>\n<p>Lately I've just been trying to broaden my scale a bit in terms of what I read and am influenced by. I try to read a lot more women writers. I think when I was younger I was always just trying to read the books written by the guys that I felt like, sort of resembled me, and now I realize that that's a huge limitation. I've gotten really interested in, I'm a big fan of Kate Christensen, I just love her novels, and I go back to them all the time. I got real into James McBride, an African-American writer, 'The Good Lord Bird' is just an absolutely amazing book. I don't know how I could ever write anything like that, but it just really turned me on a lot and kind of inspired me. It just made me energetic about writing. Not everything has to be written for me, or toward me, in order for me to be inspired and moved by it. Muriel Spark has been a big influence on me in the last couple of years. My dream would be to write my own version of 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.'  I just think that's a perfect book. So those are thne influences I'm thinking about now. I wouldn't say that I was particularly influenced by it because I'd already pretty much finished my book when I read 'The Goldfinch,' by Donna Tartt, but I just absolutely loved that book and I felt like in a lot of ways, that book validated a lot of the things that I was wrestling with as a writer because I think I struggled for a long time with the question of - is this stuff about people just living in a small town serious enough in a post- 9/11 world to merit anyone's interest? Even though there's the sort of element of terrorism as the instigating act in 'The Goldfinch,' it's really not about that. It's a coming-of-age story - a 21st Century 'Great Expectations.' To see that and just fall in love with that book and really see a lot of people moved by it,  kind of validated for me, where I was going as a writer. I have a lot of admiration for her.</p>\n<p><strong>What about the title? Did you have the idea for the title from the beginning, or was it something that you worked in later?</strong></p>\n<p>It was a totally Eureka moment. I hadn't thought about it at all - I didn't have a title. I was pretty close to finishing. I had name checked the song in the book at one point but I hadn't thought about other than it was just one of the songs that the character was thinking about when he was making a mix tape to try to impress this girl that he's trying to get close to. I was riding around in the truck, I did spend a lot of time just listening to and meditating on music that I felt like these characters would be listening to, and Neil Young's music was definitely an entry point for me because I associated it really strongly with the prime period that I was beginning the novel with. I don't remember much about it, I was really young, but I do remember that I had this record of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young with several songs on it that were Neil Young songs and just being kind of hypnotized by those when I was a kid so I associate that time with that sound which I like to say is at once ancient and other-worldly. It just sounds like it could be from another time but also from another planet. It really had that mesmerizing effect on me when I was a kid. I was listening to that a lot, and I was driving around in cars listening to 'After the Gold Rush,' and the second song on the album is 'After the Gold Rush,' just absolutely haunting, creepy, weird, wonderful song and I liked it so much I was like &quot;gosh I wish I could just crib a lyric from this song,&quot; but nothing in there really works because if you actually know the history of that song it's based on an un-produced, science fiction movie about aliens coming down to earth and there's no aliens in my book so that didn't really fit.</p>\n<p>Then the song flipped over to the third track, which is 'Only Love Can Break Your Heart.' It just hit me like a lightbulb going off over my head. That's it. There it is, that's what I'm going to call my book, 'Only Love Can Break Your Heart.' It's just perfect. And I listened to the song, and thought about the lyrics and I realized, I don't know if I had just internalized those lyrics or if it was just a coincidence, but the lyrics almost summarize the themes of the novel. The song - &quot;when you were young and on your own, how did it feel to be alone?&quot; &quot;I have a friend I've never seen, he hides his head inside a dream.&quot; It just sort of fit the problem of the main character, with the loneliness that he experiences after his brother disappears and he struggles with reconciling his love for this person that he can't really trust. So I just slapped it on there.</p>\n<p>The initial reaction to it was pretty positive. My agent loved it, and people seemed to like it, but then when I showed the book to some people, something sort of strange happened which was that a few of my friends told me &quot;I don't know, you might want to reconsider that title...maybe it might sound a little too feminine...maybe it sounds something that's like a romance, and you don't want to alienate male readers.&quot; And my initial reaction to that was, &quot;what male readers?&quot; Most of the people who I know that are pretty serious readers are women and if that's the audience I get, great right?! And the men that I know that read are quite a few but are definitely not the types of people who are scared to pick a book up because it mentions love or heartbreak in the title. And most of those are familiar with the song. I didn't want to let it go, but I did have a bit of anxiety after that where I'd go around and people would be like, &quot;so what's your book called?&quot; And I'd be like &quot;it's called...um...[slurs] Only Love Can Break Your Heart.&quot; And I'd kind of mumble it and then I'd real quickly invoke Neil Young to make sure that everybody knew that hey this is actually a song title from a super masculine, cool guy, rock singer. And then the more I thought about it I was like &quot;what it is wrong, it's stupid right? Why should I be embarrassed about this?&quot; If there's something too feminine about caring about love and heartbreak, well then I'm going to own that completely, I think those are the things that matter most to me, and I think when it comes down to it, that's true of most people. So I had to kinda get comfortable with it again but now I'm completely on the other side where I'm very proud of it and I'm very proud that hopefully I've written a book that communicates the importance of those things in my life. I think most other people will agree that when it comes down to it- that's what life is all about - love.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Post51_EdTark2.jpg\" alt=\"EdTark2\" /></p>\n<p><strong>I'm glad you stuck with it. It's a great title, it's a great cover too. Can  you talk a little about the role of religion and spirituality, which you touched on a little bit, from your childhood. Sounds like you've drawn from a lot of your childhood experiences. What was the decision there to thread this element of religion throughout the book?</strong></p>\n<p>It was a profound influence in my life when I was a boy. My mother was very devout and got real involved with other people in our town who shared those inclinations. There's a character in the novel called Miss Anita Holt, who has a kind of spiritual clairvoyance, and there actually was a woman that I knew growing up, a very close family friend, she's since passed away and I'm sad that I was not able to finish the book in time for her to be able to read it, because I think that I meant for the character to be kind of a homage to her influence on the lives of the women in our community, and she really did have an extraordinary ability to know things, that she shouldn't be able to know. We went to a traditional mainline Presbyterian church growing up and about every second or third Sunday we'd drive across town to this place called The Lighthouse, which was essentially like a Revival Church.  A tent meeting place - the type of place where the preachers were the traveling preachers, very charismatic and Pentecostal. And I can remember being very young, probably the same age or younger than Rocky, the narrator, at the beginning of the novel, and being in these Church services, where people would suddenly begin to speak in tongues. The one that I think probably made the biggest impression on me was when the pastor was in the middle of some prayer or service and this woman suddenly started crying and screaming and falling down on the ground in this sort of ecstasy. It frightened me. I asked my mother, &quot;what is going on?&quot; She explained to me that God was speaking to the woman - that she was being communicated to. She felt that God was talking to her. As I've gotten older and become more skeptical, I'm not sure that that was actually the case, but when I was a seven or eight year old kid, that made a huge impression on me. Then as I did get older and I got more skeptical, the whole concept of religion and religiousness in my life became something that I really have struggled with. I am not really a religious person anymore. But I don't deny anything. I feel like there is a great mystery out there, there are things that are beyond our understanding, that it's foolish to say that they're not. There's just too much unknown about the world to deny the existence of these things. At the same time, the tools that I feel like we've been offered, in particular, the kind of often repressive, and judgmental interpretations of Christianity in the South, can be very damaging to people. It's something that I have a lot of conflict over. Naturally, given the influence that that had over my life as a child, and also the issues that I still kind of struggle with, and my desire and need really to have a spiritual life, in conflict with the difficulties I face in really accepting that there's really any one dogmatic or doctrinal path toward that understanding. They are things that I wrestle with so naturally are going to be things that I want to write about in some capacity.</p>\n<p><strong>What about the central act that happens at the end of the book? Without giving away any spoilers, did that draw from anything in your childhood experiences?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely, from a very specific thing that happened, from a crime that took place in my town. I can't remember the exact year but I was maybe eleven or twelve years old when it happened. It was exactly as shocking as is described. The circumstances and the details are different in real life, but the effect that it had on this little town where everybody felt like it was no big deal if you forgot to lock your doors at night. It was absolutely devastating. If we're trying to avoid spoilers I can't get into too much detail but the case itself has come back into the media in the last few months. There was a big feature article about it in <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/blood-ties\">The New Yorker Magazine</a> in November, and when I saw that it was just like &quot;Whoa unbelievable, that after all this time, this case has come back up.&quot; One of the people who was ultimately held responsible for the crime is still claiming to be innocent and has developed a fairly persuasive argument that his trial should have been declared a mistrial. So he's actively lobbying to try to get out of prison right now. When I was telling the people at my publishing company, Algonquin, about this, everybody's eyes popped open and I was like &quot;oh no, but I don't want to talk about it because it'll make it so obvious - it'll spoil the ending of the book.&quot; But, it's there. It's kind of ironic because I've had a few people give it the old &quot;that would never happen&quot; remark about that particular element of the story and I'm like &quot;you bet it happen!&quot; But of course it doesn't matter if things really happened, the trick is, as a writer, you've got to make people believe that they could happen. Most people I think that have read the book - even though it's understandably shocking - most people seem to accept it and it doesn't break their suspension of disbelief of the story.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Post51_EdTark3.jpg\" alt=\"EdTark3\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Do you have plans to write any more books after this one?</strong></p>\n<p>I do. In fact, I'm delighted to say that almost two weeks ago my agent presented another contract to me from Algonquin for my next novel and we've agreed to the terms, and there's still a few minor things but it's in principle, the deal is done. I'm really excited about working with Andra Miller again, whose my editor, I think she's extremely talented and that she gets me, and she's read a significant portion of what I've written already and has a lot of enthusiasm for it so that's a real good feeling and it makes getting up in the morning and getting back to work a lot easier when you know that there's somebody on the other end waiting with excitement and with some confidence and encouragement for what you're doing.</p>\n<p><strong>Congratulations. My last question, what do you want BOTM members to take away from this book?</strong></p>\n<p>What do I want people to take away from this book? I think that so much of life now is - particularly for me as I'm easing past the years of my youth basically - really identifying my main role, my main identity in life is as a father. I really just want to believe, and I do believe, that even though terrible things are inevitable, and that we, and our children, are going to be confronted with challenges that can't be avoided, we're going to make mistakes, we're gonna pay consequences for our choices. Not everything is going to be easy. I do believe that love and forgiveness can overcome almost anything. As I mentioned before, I'm not a particularly religious person, I'm pretty skeptical. But I do believe in the power of forgiveness and reconciliation. Many terrible things befall the people in this novel, relatively speaking, obviously there are much more terrible things that people endure, but, our concept of pain is relative to our experience and so by most people's concept the things that these people endure are terrible things. Yet I think that they find a way to live on and to grow from those things and to continue forward. There is life and love beyond pain. I do believe that. That may sound naive and unnecessarily optimistic - maybe I'm wrong about that - maybe I want to believe that because I've got small kids and I want to have hope for their future happiness, but I know in my own life that things that I didn't think I was ever going to be able to overcome, or get past, don't matter that much to me anymore because of the things that I do have. Hopefully, when people put the book down, they'll feel that way, and also that the things that they suffer are worth it. That what we go through for the people that we love, and what we suffer, on their behalf, what we watch them suffer which also causes us pain - it's worth it. Life would be pretty empty without it.</p>\n","cover_img":"EdTark5_663x400.jpg","post_img":"EdTark5_663x400.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Ed Tarkington","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":""},{"id":50,"title":"<p>Judge Kim Hubbard on 'When Breath Becomes Air'</p>\n","subtitle":"<p>&quot;It's a brilliant, inspiring exploration of how to live a meaningful life in the face of death&quot;</p>\n","summary":"<p>Judge Kim Hubbard selected the heartbreakingly beautiful memoir, <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=102\">'When Breath Becomes Air,'</a> in which Stanford Neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi details his experience being diagnosed with terminal cancer and deciding how to spend his remaining days.

Written by Paul Kalanithi after he was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer, the Stanford neurosurgeon, who also has a Masters in English Literature, examines some of life’s most important questions: What do we do with the time we have left and how do we live meaningfully? Some of his answers included spending time with his wife Lucy, and having a daughter named Cady. Lucy wrote the Epilogue to Paul’s memoir after he passed away in March 2015, and has recently been busy sharing Paul’s words with the world. We spoke with her in a 30 minute interview.</p>\n<p>Check out the full audio interview here or read the full transcript below:</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MQFvN5QNYUQ?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>I read this book it was beautiful and hard to keep a dry eye - what has the whole process been like for you? Finishing the book, dealing with his death at the same time as raising your daughter. Can you update us on your life and how you've been dealing with all of this?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I sort of don't even know where to start. It's obviously totally surreal, especially now that the book has come out, it's like this mixing of private, personal, with public. As an example, I haven't been to Paul's grave in a week or two because I've been so busy with the book promotion, it's sort of like the good news and the bad news, you know. But it's been really wonderful and kind of a consolation for me - it was so important for me to complete it and carry it forward because Paul had worked so hard on it and I felt like he really had important things to say in drawing in his experiences, not only as a terminally ill person, but also drawing on his background in medicine and then literature and philosophy. I am so proud of him, that it was really wonderful to do this for him - finish it. Make sure it happened, that what he was trying to do happened. Then also feel connected to him still through that process.</p>\n<p><strong>You talked about this a little in the book but what was your reaction when Paul first decided he wanted to document this experience? Obviously he was passionate about writing - but it's such a personal experience for you and your family. Were you hesitant at all in the beginning?</strong></p>\n<p>About him writing a memoir?</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah.</strong></p>\n<p>I would say not hesitant, although like a little bit surprised and interested in how he was making those choices. The first thing he wrote was a personal essay, almost like a journal entry, that ended up being that piece, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/opinion/sunday/how-long-have-i-got-left.html\">'How Long Have I Got Left?'</a> in the New York Times. He got this really immediate gratifying response to that where he suddenly was connected to other patients, or doctors, or others who responded to the themes in that piece. It was interesting because he said you know, this is such a personal story, he was almost surprised it resonated with other people and then it sort of became obvious, in the singular experience, people can see themselves and connect to each other through stories. The fact that he had always wanted to be a writer and then had this initial positive experience writing something public that led him to do that.</p>\n<p>He was quite a private person, or he could be a private person, so it was actually interesting to see him want to be public with such a personal experience facing illness. He did start writing and then he did a couple of public interviews, like including an interview on stage at Stanford speaking with a Palliative care physician about his experience. It sort of became obvious why he would want to share that and stay connected through this purpose. I almost was surprised by how deeply authentic and detailed he was in describing his personal experience. Because he really didn't spare himself or anybody else anything. When he was writing the book, he writes about his own failures, and he just writes really starkly in some ways. But I actually think part of the reason people seem to be responding to the book is how authentic it is. So it kind of surprised me a little bit, but then now in retrospect it really makes sense to me. I wrote this piece recently in the New York Times called <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/my-marriage-didnt-end-when-i-became-a-widow/\">'My Marriage Didn't End When I Became a Widow'</a> and I don't think I ever would have done that had it not been for Paul's paving the way and then realizing how consoling it is to connect with people.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Post51_AirCoupleB_663x400.jpg\" alt=\"AirCouple\" /></p>\n<p>I also thought about our own experiences reading, Paul read so much poetry and literature about facing mortality. It was so helpful to him. He left this book behind, so to speak, a friend of his had given him this book 'Lament For a Son.' It's by this guy Nick Wolterstorff who was a Professor at Yale who lost his son in a mountain climbing accident when his son was 25. Nick Wolterstorff wrote this tiny little volume called 'Lament For a Son,' it's super mournful and just really stark and personal and Paul read it and loved it and before he died he said &quot;can you give this to my parents when I die?&quot; It was very helpful for his parents. It includes all these beautiful ideas - like the idea of owning your grief, not trying to suppress your grief, or he says this beautiful thing, where he says, &quot;every lament is a love song.&quot; It talks about how grief is the flip side of love, the deeper your grief, the deeper your love. That's another example of this really singular experience that Dr. Wolterstorff writes about but then you realize how consoling and fortifying it is in your own life. I think Paul aims to do that same thing. He was writing for himself but he was definitely writing for readers and taking them into this personal experience that in a way then illustrates the universal and makes people feel connected, the more personal it actually is.</p>\n<p><strong>That brings me to what you were speaking about - the role of literature and how that consoled him and helped him - Sam Beckett's &quot;I can't go on. I'll go on.&quot; Do you have any pieces of literature that you turn to now? I read an interview with Paul saying he was so fascinated by you when you guys first meet because you had a bookshelf full of books but that you didn't like to read.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Post51_AirCoupleA_663x400.jpg\" alt=\"AIrCouple2\" /></p>\n<p>I was sort of laughing. He sort of outed me for something which was like, half of those books were books I acquired and wanted to read and half those books are books I love. He thought it was hilarious. He was like, &quot;What did you think of this book?&quot; and I was like &quot;I haven't read it yet.&quot; And he was like &quot;What! Why is it on your bookshelf?&quot; I actually think you're allowed to do that too.</p>\n<p>Especially since he died - we had very different tastes in literature. I actually considered myself a reader just not compared to Paul, Paul was just like unbelievably connected to books and just had like - he never could throw away a book. His parents still have like 22 boxes of books at their house in Arizona because Paul never ever rid himself of a book, ever. I'm a reader, just not to that extreme degree. I kind of like recent, non-fiction, which is different from Paul liking English literature, as far back as it goes. Poetry has been really helpful for me since Paul died. There are all these beautiful poems. I really love, &quot;Surprised by Joy,&quot; which is this [William] Wordsworth poem about the experience of grief, and then I love this other poem called, &quot;Last Night the Rain Spoke To Me,&quot; I think it's a Mary Oliver poem. It's sort of about the idea of going forward and the last line is something like, &quot;Oh the long and wondrous journeys still to be ours.&quot; And it makes me think of me and Cady. It's kind of like this turning forward and remaining in the moment.</p>\n<p>There's another poem called, &quot;Elegy to Philip Sidney,&quot; which is by Greville, who's a poet, whose poem Paul drew the epigraph in the title for his book from. This other poem, &quot;Elegy to Philip Sidney,&quot; is like 600 years old and it's about Greville losing his best friend, Philip Sidney, and it's so, so, so heartbreaking. There are a couple of lines that really make me think of Paul. The last few lines say - talking about going to a grave - and it says something like &quot;Salute the stones that keep the limbs that held so good a mind.&quot; It's just this heartbreaking thing that's kind of like a tribute, and a lament, and it makes me think of Paul. There's also another line in that poem that says &quot;Death slew not him, but he made death his ladder to the skies.&quot; I can barely say it without crying. It's sort of like...I really like the idea of, there's the battle metaphor for cancer. Which often works, but not for terminal cancer.</p>\n<p>There was a headline after Paul died, his death got covered in a few local news pieces. One of them said, &quot;Stanford Neurosurgeon Succumbs to Cancer.&quot; I was like, I don't think Paul succumbed. He died, but I don't think he succumbed. That theme shows up in literature. So do a lot of others. Poetry has been very helpful. I've read, 'The Year of Magical Thinking,' before, and I keep thinking I should go back and read it. I read C.S. Lewis' terrible book on grief, I mean terrible because it's so heartbreaking. It's almost too painful to read, he's so pained that I almost couldn't do it. It just depends what strikes you. I have been reading a lot since Paul died.</p>\n<p><strong>That brings me to my next question which is from Kim Hubbard, who selected your book, she's the books editor at People Magazine. She said that she was floored by your writing and thought you were such a beautiful writer yourself. Do you have plans to write your own book?</strong></p>\n<p>No. I've learned, since, learning more about publishing and writing, that writers don't have to love writing. I think Paul actually loved writing, he enjoyed the actual process of writing. Even though it was hard work. For me writing feels a little more like pulling teeth. With that New York Times piece ultimately it feels like my heart is on that page. I feel so good about what's written there but the process - it takes me a very long time. I need a lot of help with it. It's easier for me to talk than to write. I think, I'm more of a talker than a writer, so I'll have to figure out what to do with that.</p>\n<p><strong>Fair enough. I wanted to ask about something you said in the Epilogue about thinking the only thing really missing from the book was Paul's sense of humor. I'm curious about that. Can you tell us more about it to get a better sense of who Paul was?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Post51_AirMoustache_663x400.jpg\" alt=\"AirMustache\" /></p>\n<p>Yeah. It's funny because I did an interview with Katie Couric last week, her piece just came out on <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/katiecouric/when-breath-becomes-aira-young-father-and-133132815.html\">Yahoo News</a> and it's like this 9-minute news piece. And at the beginning she let me talk about how Paul was really funny. I don't know if you can <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/katiecouric/when-breath-becomes-aira-young-father-and-133132815.html\">link</a> to it - but it definitely gives people an example. I talk at the beginning - there's these pictures of him being sweet and goofy and then I talk about this little detail, which was, when we were in medical school he had been a sketch comedian in college and he was an extremely talented comedy writer. I say in this Katie Couric thing and they even show a photo where Paul had a fake mustache in his Yale Medical School ID for four years. He had thrown it on at the beginning of med school out of his pocket he put the mustache on right before they took the ID photo. I think for him it was almost like this anodyne...at the time he thought he would enter medical school and then become too serious. I think it was like almost a challenge to himself, to retain himself.</p>\n<p>The book is really serious, and it's written by a dying person, and it draws on the deepness of Paul's intellectual self. But then he was super, super funny and even his friends who read the book will say like &quot;Oh it's not funny enough.&quot; But it's like, that's not who Paul aspired to be as a writer in the world. He just was so cute and snuggly and funny. It's funny because, I read this interview a long time ago, there's this psychologist at Harvard called Dan Gilbert. He's talking about his best friend who died whose another psychologist named Dan Wegner and he <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/07/11/daniel-wegner-harvard-social-psychologist-unraveled-mysteries-thought-and-memory/SATmfA8Vo07c5lezCPZFyH/story.html\">says</a> this thing: &quot;Humor is the place where intelligence and joy meet.&quot;  And it's like, it was this lovely thing to say about his friend, and I loved it because I think the same thing about Paul. He was super funny and it was that same kind of idea, he was observant, and joyful and it came out in this other way too.</p>\n<p><strong>I love that. Can you give us an update on your daughter? How is she doing?</strong></p>\n<p>She's 18 months. She's doing great. It's really funny because she just doesn't know what's happening. She loved Paul, and then Paul died, and she wasn't really aware, and now the book's coming out, and she doesn't know...When Paul was alive, he wasn't a famous writer, and then now it appears that he's a famous writer, so it'll be interesting to see what kind of relationship she develops with him and his legacy at various stages in her life. She's a really sweet kid and she really looks like a mix of me and Paul. I'm sure it's easy for me to notice things in her that seem similar to Paul, but it's like, she's got these kind of fiery, dark eyes and she's unflappable and she's really funny and she loves books. There are pieces of her that remind me of Paul. At the same time, she's not replacing Paul. She's her own person, and now that she's starting to talk and be willful, I feel like I'm getting to know her. She's turning from an infant into a little person. She's doing great, she's really thriving. We have a really wonderful community and family, and so I feel like even though Paul's not here, I feel really happy about all the support that she has and that I have.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Post52_AirFamilyB_663x400.jpg\" alt=\"Family\" /></p>\n<p><strong>To that point, how are you juggling all the press for the book and then being a doctor, and having a family?</strong></p>\n<p>Well thankfully I work at a really amazing Institute at Stanford that thinks about healthcare value. I've worked there first as a Postdoctoral Fellow and then now as a Junior Faculty Member, ever since Paul got sick. It's a really humane place to work and they've been really supportive of me and Paul and our family and let me have a flexible schedule and then now I still have a flexible schedule to be able to do this work on Paul's book and then I'm ramping up my commitment to them again. So thankfully I'm not juggling too many things at once, and then I have a lot of help taking care of Cady, even though I've been on this leave from work, especially now with publicity, been working on behalf of Paul kind of full-time on the book, so that's gone up and down, but I have a lot of help balancing it.</p>\n<p>It's all kind of a joy. Cady's amazing and the book - I'm really glad that the book is happening for Paul and I'm really glad that I got to work on it. I raised this a little bit in the New York Times piece, the idea of carrying something forward for Paul but also kind of molting Paul at the same time. I think this is like a way to stay connected to Paul but then also stretch me into the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, that’s great. Besides getting to know Paul, what do you want Book of the Month readers, or any readers really, to take away from this book?</strong></p>\n<p>I guess, I'm really grateful. I want to express gratitude that people are reading it. And it's amazing that it's being featured by you guys, and Paul dreamed of becoming a writer, and it's really amazing. Then I guess, one of the things that's been gratifying, or that I think the book has the potential to do is help people reflect on their own situations. Whether that's their own illness, or their mortality, or their choices, or sick or aging family members, I think it's an opportunity to start personal conversations. I think illness and death are really hard to talk about, but I think this book sort of is a little piece of this larger opportunity for us to be talking to each other in a realistic way about our healthcare and our lives and our ability to take care of each other and the resources we need to be able to do that in our communities and in our families. So I think that, insofar as I picture discussions that come out of this book, I think they are actually not necessarily going to be about Paul, I think they're going to be about the readers own lives. I think - I'm really proud of Paul for being able to be kind of like a springboard for people to then bring up important things in their own lives or in their family.</p>\n","cover_img":"AirFamilyA_663x400.jpg","post_img":"AirFamilyA_663x400.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Lucy Kalanithi","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":""},{"id":52,"title":"<p>TODAY's Hoda Kotb on her Book of the Month</p>\n","subtitle":"<p>&quot;The book is so awesome because it shows how music changes lives&quot;</p>\n","summary":"<p>TODAY Show Co-Host and February Guest Judge Hoda Kotb <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=98\">selected</a> Mitch Albom's 'The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto.'

Here are some of the highlights:</p>\n<p><strong>CRANDERSON13:</strong> I am posting with an understanding that Ms. Macallister will be responding to questions. As a whole, I did enjoy this novel. The narrative form was an interesting one, lying both in the present circumstances of the characters' immediate dilemmas and in Arden's life story. By what means did you craft this novel? Did you write this in the order that it reads, or did you write multiple chapters of Arden's story while later breaking them up with the interrogation chapters' Also, if you have time, what are your personal writing habits' Did you craft this on a strict schedule and how long did this take from conception to publication?</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance!</p>\n<p><strong>GMACALLISTER:</strong> Great question! Because of the framework you mention, it was a particularly complicated process of writing and rewriting. I wrote the first draft in the order it came to me, but during the editing process I separated the Virgil/Arden scenes from the story Arden is telling, and edited them separately. Then I'd piece it back together. Repeated that process several times, making sure both stories were moving forward, and sharpening the flow of the book each time.</p>\n<p>From the initial inspiration to publication, it took a little over six years. Publishing is not for the impatient! Though I did also have two babies during those six years so that slowed me down a bit. I'm not a writer who writes every single day, but if I'm actively drafting a book I definitely move the book forward in some way every day, whether writing, researching, doing plot work, etc. Momentum is important. Hope that answers your question!</p>\n<p><strong>AVIDREADER:</strong> I really like endings that leave me curious about what may happen next, and this one did exactly that. As Whoopi said, the characters are changed by the end and I wonder what their futures may bring. I love that you created hopeful possibilities for Virgil and Arden. Do you have any plans to continue their stories, or are you working on something else?</p>\n<p><strong>GMACALLISTER:</strong> Wonderful -- so glad you enjoyed it! Endings make such a huge impact on my enjoyment of a book as a reader, and it sounds like they do for you too.</p>\n<p>I do wonder what happens to Virgil and Arden (among others) after we leave them on the last page; I'm definitely open to exploring that in the future. I'm also considering writing more about Adelaide Herrmann, whose exciting real life included far more than I was able to write about in The Magician's Lie.</p>\n<p>But my current project, GIRL IN DISGUISE, is a novel about Kate Warne, the first female private detective in the US, hired by Allan Pinkerton in 1856. It should hit shelves in about a year. Like TML, it's the story of a woman ahead of her time who ruffles a lot of feathers -- I think you'll like it!</p>\n","cover_img":"663x400_MagLieComp.jpg","post_img":"663x400_MagLieComp.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Greer Macallister","youtube_link":null,"live_date":"2016-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":""},{"id":44,"title":"<p>Why It's Important to Read Great Books</p>\n","subtitle":"<p>From the intellectual to the emotional benefits, picking up a book will greatly enhance your life</p>\n","summary":"<p>At Book of the Month we believe in the power of great books.

In a 2013 <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6156/377.abstract\">study for Science Magazine</a>, social psychologists found that reading literary fiction, or narratives that focus on subjects' inner feelings and thoughts, improves 'Theory of Mind.' Theory of Mind is the ability to navigate complex social relationships and is measured by tests of empathy, social perception, and emotional intelligence. After just a few minutes of reading, participants who read literary fiction were better able to identify the emotions of subjects presented to them than those who had read other genres or had read nothing at all.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Post44_Coffee.jpg\" alt=\"Coffee\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Books are the Ultimate Stress Reducer</strong></p>\n<p>Many excuses for not reading center around not having enough time. Instead of thinking about reading as a source of stress, think about it as a stress reliever. In a 2009 <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/5070874/Reading-can-help-reduce-stress.html\">University of Sussex study</a> commissioned by consultancy Mindlab International, researchers found that reading a book for just six minutes reduced stress in participants, as measured by a slower heart rate and less tension in the muscles. The researchers commented, &quot;This is more than merely a distraction but an active engaging of the imagination as the words on the printed page stimulate your creativity and cause you to enter what is essentially an altered state of consciousness.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Having Books on Your Shelves Might Make Your Kids Smarter</strong></p>\n<p>In a 2014 study, <a href=\"http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/92/4/1573.full\">the sociologists at Social Forces</a> concluded that the number of books in a home has a strong influence on children's academic performance. The researchers behind the study found this to be true across 42 nations, and even after controlling for factors like parents' education, parents' occupation, and family wealth. They found that gains in academic performance are larger at the bottom - meaning that building a library from 5 to 10 books will have a greater impact than adding a 100th book. Thus, enjoying books which can then fill your shelves doesn't just impact you - it can have a positive impact on those young minds in your home.

As <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/magazine.html?postId=8\">Whoopi Goldberg</a> so eloquently, put it, reading allows you to 'sit on the can and be on the moon at the same time.' Whether you use reading to teach you something new, to escape the stresses of the world, or just to hear a good story, there's no denying that reading is enjoyable.</p>\n<p>We hope we've given you enough reasons to sit down with a good book.

I was blown away by the variety in selection options, the panel of judges, and the fervor with which each judge pushed his or her book each month. How can that kind of excitement not be contagious? My second month rolled around and I opted for Liberty Hardy's pick: F.H. Batacan's 'Smaller and Smaller Circles,' which proceeded to blow my socks off. This is a book I never would have heard about (which is a crime, it should be shouted about from the rooftops) and which became one of my favorite reads of the year.</p>\n<p>That experience sold me. I have now signed up for a year subscription and eagerly anticipate each month's selection email in my inbox. It's also the little things. Each monthly box comes with a note from the judge and the books are carefully wrapped so as to avoid damage in the mail. Additional titles available for $9.99 is also a great draw.

How did you get into all of this?</strong></p>\n<p>I knew I had a love for literature ever since I read 'Lord of the Flies'  in 5th grade English. My teacher had turned to me during a class discussion and asked, &quot;Did you read that analysis somewhere?&quot; I told her I had simply interpreted the story, but she hesitated to believe me. Her disbelief made me realize I had a special connection with books and eventually led me to pursue the study of literature. Years later, around the time I started teaching, I created an Instagram account to inspire my students to read. I rarely read without a steaming cup of coffee in hand (hence <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/booksandbeans/\">@BooksandBeans</a>), and so I always brewed a fresh pot of coffee for my students and brought it with me to class. After reading and analyzing the course texts, students would ask me what I thought about certain books I had posted on Instagram and would even share fun facts about books they were currently reading. Then we'd end the class with a relaxing yoga pose. It is a wonderfully inspiring environment to be in.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some of your favorite books?</strong></p>\n<p>Some of my favorite books include 'The Bell Jar' by Sylvia Plath, 'A Thousand Splendid Suns'\nby Khaled Hosseini, 'We Should All Be Feminists' by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, 'Olive Kitteridge' by Elizabeth Strout, and, of course, 'Harry Potter'.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some of your favorite book covers?</strong></p>\n<p>My absolute favorite book cover of all time belongs to F.

Something about the smell of coffee, the quiet clatter of cups and spoons, and the distant trickling of rain against the window makes for the most soothing background noise while reading. I studied writing at Yale this summer, and I spent most of my time curled up in odd corners on campus watching the rain from behind glass as I wrote and read.

What prompted you to write this book?</strong></p>\n<p>Well my reasons for writing the book have always been very personal, my sisters started asking about our parents and where we had come from when I was in my early 20s and i was raising my sisters - they were 8, 10 and, 12, and they started asking me about what happened to our mom and I hadn't even realized that I hadn't told them because we left  LeBaron [the fundamentalist Mormon community where she grew up] when they were so young and so at that point I was still in college and I didn't really have time to start writing the book but i knew that I really wanted to for them, so that they could understand our personal history and why we grew up without parents. So it's for them, it's for my sisters to understand our mother in a way that I did as a child that they weren't able to.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/RuthWariner_Post36_LanesShop.jpg\" alt=\"Lane's Shop\" /></p>\n<p><strong>It was obviously an emotional book, it was emotional for me as a reader, how did you feel as you were actually getting this all down on the page?</strong></p>\n<p>There were times, especially during the most tragic scenes and the saddest scenes that I definitely had to step away from the page and take a break from writing and sometimes I wouldn't be able to come back to the page for a couple of days. And it was hard but I also ended up having so many memories come up that were good for me to face and let go of, and when I was writing about it, it was definitely cathartic, there was a lot of healing I went through as I was writing. and I was able to leave a lot of that on the page even though it took me a while to get it out, it wasn't the type of thing I could sit down and write about for 8 hours a day, I definitely had to take my breaks because it was so emotional and thinking about my mom and the way she looked, the way she smelled, and the things she used to say and her quirky little jokes and different things like that were hard but they were good for me too because I needed to remember her as an adult. Writing about her really helped me have more compassion for her and her situation and I think that was really helpful. And even though the story was a hard one to tell I think I found a lot of forgiveness for her because it helped me understand her better.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/RuthWariner_Post36_StrathmoreCA.jpg\" alt=\"StrathmoreCA\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Going into that, this relationship with your mother was one of the most complex and important relationships in this memoir - what are your feelings towards her today, you talked about forgiveness?</strong></p>\n<p>There are still times when I don't understand her choice to stay, there are times when I still will dream about her and be frustrated with her, like &quot;why did you stay?&quot; But that doesn't happen very often anymore. I think that as I've grown into womanhood and facing the struggles that maybe a lot of women face and that I believe my mom faced, was just that lack of self love that she had for herself because I inherited part of that because of my childhood and because of the way that Fundamentalist Mormon religion treated women. I believe she didn't learn a lot of self love and didn't have a lot of confidence, and she ended up in a religion and a lifestyle that validated the way she felt about herself - and that's just me, as I didn't get to know her as an adult - but that was me reflecting back on her and then again on my own life and realizing that I had to learn to care for myself and love myself and nurture myself in a way that my mother was never able to and I don't know if that was because of her generation, if that was just the culture or what that was. I've learned to deal with that in myself I really feel like I was learning to forgive my mom at the same time  because she believed something that kept her from growing and learning and being out in the world. I also see other women in that situation especially knowing women back then, there were so many women that stayed that had several children, and then especially my mom having three disabled children and in addition to seven other children and the situation that they put themselves in or they find themselves in eventually it's really hard to get out of, so there has been a lot of forgiveness - a lot of forgiveness for my mother and a lot of forgiveness for myself but there's still some residual like, &quot;why did all that happen?&quot;, kind of thing and it comes up once in awhile but for the most part... It was also cultural, you know like I said I look at a lot of the women there that stayed in similar situations and it was what the people from colonia LeBaron or the women back then in the 70s and 80s did - they stayed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/RuthWariner_Post36_Edgefield.jpg\" alt=\"Edgefield\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Along that concept of learning to love yourself, brings me to one quote at the end of your book when you're talking about meeting your husband and having such a wonderful man - you say:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&quot;It took years of counseling, prayer, meditation, and self-reflection before I felt worthy of a man with such qualities. I had much to discover and nurture in myself first. On this day, I realize that all the work was worth it.?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How did you realize that you could do the work and how did you between all of your responsibilities, how did you kind of come to that realization and do all that work?</strong></p>\n<p>For me it started when I started raising my sisters one, because I wanted to be a better person once I became responsible for their lives there was a part of me that naturally wanted a better life for myself and for them. I was working at the time - gosh they were 4, 6, and 8 i think at the time - when I was a secretary in accounts receivable at a wrecking yard, in southern Oregon, in Grants Pass, Oregon and I was on my own at that point with my sisters making $6.75 an hour I mean it was just not a living wage and we were still on welfare, and I just wanted a better life for ourselves and I had spent a lot of time in their classrooms, and really loved being around kids and learning and loved to see how children light up when they discover something new or when they figure something out and so I really wanted to go back to college to be a teacher. I started community college, and when I started community college, I started taking a lot of literature classes, and world religions classes and philosophy of religion and it kind of opened in my mind into so many different ways of thinking and thinking about myself and my life, and I started questioning in a way that i hadn't before - questioning my own life and what I wanted from it and how I wanted to move forward and what kind of lifestyle I wanted - those kinds of questions that I had never been introduced to before in my childhood. So i think for me it really started with my education and a love of learning and a desire to want to do more and to do better with my own life. And I started writing a lot and after I took one of my world religions classes, and i was still at the community college level, but I was just so fascinated at how different religions believed and for me it was always - I always picked up on the similarities in the religions and really, it kind of strengthened my faith in God. Different religions have a different word for it, but that's what it was for me, and to start wondering about my own spirituality and questioning it, and I decided, I wrote research papers on - I made this one choice in a writing class, I decided I wanted to compare Jesus and Buddha's teachings. It was after I had taken the world religions class and I was just so fascinated about how similar their teachings were and the way that they taught, so I thought, I just had this brilliant, I was so excited about this idea that I thought was so original and then I went to our small little library and started to do research on it thinking I would find separate books, explaining that and found probably at least 20 or 30 books just in that tiny library about people who had already written about the same topic - so for me it was this exciting new thing but obviously people had been seeing those similarities for centuries and had already written bout it. So I started to love to learn about those kinds of things and question and at that point I started to learn to love just what i was inspired by and one of them was learning and growing and then once I became a teacher and I was still constantly - I've always been a reflective person and I was still learning about myself because I was still raising my sisters and when I started teaching high school they were teenagers at that point and they actually came to the school where I was teaching and I taught two of my youngest sister.</p>\n<p>Once I started teaching, and I had benefits, I had really good benefits, mental health benefits, and i had always wanted to go to counseling but couldn't afford it until then and I was in my late 20s at that point, and it took me a while, but found a good therapist that was honest that had experience with women and children who had had traumatic childhoods similar to mine, and she knew a lot about the fundamentalist Mormon religion, too. So I was able to relate to her at that level as well, and I worked with her for several years and sometimes I still go back to her and it was good for me to be able to talk out things and she was really good at giving me advice about what was going on inside me and just helped me find a deeper level of maturity to myself and she kept telling me I needed to re-parent myself because the way i grew up wasn't normal. I think therapy really helped, you know my family I grew up with them too and my relationships with other people - I learned a lot about myself through that. It's been a process, I'm still learning, I'm still learning and growing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/RuthWariner_Post36_40th.jpg\" alt=\"40th\" /></p>\n<p><strong>So can I ask you about your siblings...How do you feel that your younger sisters, that you had to raise them? Do you wish that they had had your upbringing and grew up in LeBaron or how do you feel about how everything happened?</strong></p>\n<p>I am glad that my sisters didn't grow up in LeBaron, I wish that we had had normal parents. Quote, unquote &quot;normal parents.&quot; I mean I guess everybody's got their family histories, every family's got their secrets and their dysfunction but I think we missed out on not having parents. I think that's been hard on all of us i know it has been on me- but to go back to that culture where, at least back then when I was there, women weren't respected at all, children didn't really have a voice, they were - nobody ever said it - but they were meant to be seen and not heard. I grew up with so much of my childhood not having a voice and not having a say in my own life and I just thought that was normal at the time so would I have wanted my sisters to grow up in that culture - probably not - they're pretty independent, strong women, really smart they do well in their lives and so I guess there are some things that I wish we had but not in colonia LeBaron. I don't think I would go back there.</p>\n<p><strong>One of your quotes:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&quot;The memory of those days reminds me of how exhausted I had been, but my siblings gave my life purpose, they were the bridge from pain to healing, from past to future. They are as much the authors of my survival as I am of theirs.&quot;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You're talking about raising them at a very young age, how did you even have the strength to support them while you were getting your education, and how did you even - I guess you were raising children from a very young age even when your mother was there - but how did you step into that role?</strong></p>\n<p>I stepped into that role I felt like at the time pretty naturally. We lived with my grandmother for 4 years and she helped me, I got my GED while I was living with her and I took home study classes to help with my sisters and as she got progressively older and she had advanced diabetes and some other heart problems and stuff and as she got sicker, and wasn't able to have us live with her anymore, I really felt like I wanted, like it was the natural thing for my sisters and I to stay together. So for me, it just felt natural and when I made that choice I was 19 when I moved out on my own with them and I didn't know what I, like most parents, especially single parents, I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I was working and part of the way we supported ourselves for me was on student loans, part-time jobs, and on welfare so we were still collecting food stamps really for a while - really until I graduated, finished with graduate school and started teaching. As I was raising them there were definitely times where it's like am I doing the right thing here, is it the best thing for people to do when they don't have parents to raise their siblings? Do we all have to stay together? So I doubted myself and I questioned myself quite a bit but for me it always came back to - yes this is worth it I want my family to be with me and I want them to be OK. So just the relationships with them and wanting to be with them. My younger brother Aaron stayed with us and lived with us for a few years too, for me, that was what was familiar, it's what i knew - I think had I lost them as well, I don't think I would have been as emotionally stable. I don't know if that makes sense but they did bring stability to my life, in spite of how hard it is to be a single parent. So for me it was it was definitely worth it - and was it challenging? Absolutely. I was learning about myself, I was growing up basically at the same time I was raising them and sometimes I think about it and I think that maybe I would like to have them as little girls now, because they were just so adorable and to be able to raise them from a more mature place, and a more grown up place, and you know a place where we're not as poor. I would have been able to provide for them better had I been older but that's what the situation was and for what it was, I'm grateful for what we were able to do in spite of how hard it was.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/RuthWariner_Post36_Lebaron.jpg\" alt=\"Lebaron\" /></p>\n<p><strong>You were very lucky to have them. So talking about if you had had them today - can you talk to us about your life today, your career, your marriage, your religious beliefs?</strong></p>\n<p>I live in Portland, Oregon, I've been married to my husband Allen, it's my first marriage, and we've been married for six and a half years now and I quit teaching - I taught high school Spanish for 8 years - and I quit teaching to start writing the book and I helped my husband's business a little bit, he owns his own consulting business for city and regional magazines. I help him a little with that but for the most part for now I'm working full-time on my writing and the promotion of the book. It's been challenging but it's been a lot of fun and I'm learning a lot so that's always been my thing - I've always loved to be challenged and to keep learning so it's been good in that regard. I have two little sisters that live here locally - my youngest sisters, Leah and Holly, rent a house together in Southeast Portland and I just had dinner with them last night. We talk on the phone - they actually, my three little sisters talk to each other on the phone all the time, but I'm glad if they do and if I am ever concerned about one or the other I'll ask Holly about how Leah is doing and she'll tell me all about it because they talk to each other constantly. The oldest of the three, Elena, lives in Seattle and she works at Boeing. She's got a beautiful little apartment there and we just spent Christmas with her in her new apartment with a panoramic view of the Space Needle and the Sound, and so that was really fun. My brother Aaron also lives in Seattle, he's a mechanical engineer there, and he's doing really well too. We spend the holidays together all the time. I see them, my family in Seattle, every few months, and then my brother Luke lives in Southern Oregon and my Aunt and Uncle help take care of him there. He's my special needs brother and he plays Special Olympics - he plays sports about 3 times a year - and plays a variety of sports and works at a nursery, called Greenleaf in Grants Pass Oregon. He's doing really well and my oldest brother Matt is still involved with the church - the fundamentalist Church that my father started. He's tried to live with me a couple different times, it's not quite working out, it doesn't seem to be fitting into his - you know the modern life - my mother's generation was much more into the religion I think than my generation and my brother's generation so it's becoming harder and harder for that culture to continue on just because of the cost of living and for practical reasons I think more than anything else. But he's doing well, he has 14 children and his youngest wife will probably keep having children for a while. We see him a couple of times a year. Religiously, I don't belong to the fundamentalist Mormon or the LDS Mormon Church. It's just not a religion that inspired me and I do believe in God, I start everyday out with journaling and my prayers and my quiet time to help center me and get me focused on what's more positive in life and i need that for myself everyday. To me, religion - I have trouble with organized religion - but really for me it's important but it's also very personal, it's not something that I need to convince anybody of or to say that I'm right and you're wrong. It's just more of a healing part of my own life, a spirituality that I practice, that helps keep me centered and sane I guess in our crazy world. I believe in god but I don't believe he belongs to any one particular religion - that that spirit of creation belongs to any one group of people.</p>\n<p><strong>I'm so glad everyone is doing well.</strong></p>\n<p>We feel very lucky and feel very blessed and I think that keeping us together really helped us stay stable and helped us grow up with some healthy relationships and perspectives.</p>\n<p><strong>I want to ask you a little bit more generally about your favorite books and favorite authors and are there any favorite books from childhood that stand out to you?</strong></p>\n<p>There was one book in my childhood that I loved and it was actually based on the bible and I had heard a lot of bible stories back then, I think I was 6 or 7 years old, and there's a little bit of a scene of it in my book in &quot;The Sound of Gravel&quot;. The reason I think I loved the book so much was because my grandfather read it to me and it was called 'Joseph and the Coat of Many Colors' and it was an Old Testament story that I fell in love with I think because there was the sibling connection, even though it was a painful story about siblings betraying each other, but I loved the way my grandfather read to me and I think he really - the special attention that i got from him, my mother's father - was something that helped me enjoy and love reading so much. My favorite, I love historical fiction and probably my favorite historical fiction book was &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha,&quot; it's an older book now but I love the characters and the description and the times that it was set in WWII it was just so fascinating to me because I feel like I really was transported to another culture that I'd never been to and learned from that story. I was so surprised and so impressed that it was written in a female voice by a man and I thought that was extremely smart and thought the writer was so talented. I love a lot of spiritual readings and one of my favorite books of all times I think was Eckhart Tolle's 'A New Earth' - I loved that book. I owned it three or four times and kept loaning it out and had to buy it again and every time I read it, I kept underlining and highlighting my favorite parts over and over again that I actually still go back to and read because I feel like they're so inspirational and really feed my soul. I love Eckhart Tolle, I follow him quite a bit and I also love Iyanla Vanzant, she wrote a book, I think it was 'Yesterday I Cried' and that was partly her memoir and it was also a spiritual and sort of a self-help book, at least that's how I took it, and I loved hearing about her life because she told it in such a way that was very direct and honest but also in a way that helped me heal because I was able to believe in a God that was loving and accepting and forgiving rather than having this God that was going to come down and punish me for every cup of coffee or glass of wine that I drank. Her life story helped heal me and so I've been following her for a while too. More recently, gosh I bet everybody's probably read this book, another historical fiction set during WWII was 'All the Light We Cannot See' and Anthony Doerr...And i just loved the book. I listen to a lot of audiobooks so I listened to that book on tape and was totally transported into a different life, in a different world, and I have a lot of prayer books I read from people like Marianne Williamson, Tosha Silver, people like that. I belong to two book clubs so I can't even remember all the books I've read but those are the ones that stand out to me.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about your book being featured in BOTM?</strong></p>\n<p>It's so exciting I was reading some of the reviews of the other books and I feel completely honored and flattered and just completely blown away that it was chosen. It's hard to be a new author, I'm learning. It's hard and it's wonderful and it's exciting, but it's so nice to have this kind of support early on it really feels like every author should be this lucky. I really feel very very fortunate to be included, and I was reading too about the Judges and it's pretty prestigious. I know who all these people are - all these editors from magazines and newspapers and movie stars - it's a pretty incredible group of people and writers to be included with i feel very very fortunate.</p>\n<p><strong>We're very excited to be featuring you, it's a powerful memoir and story so thank you for sharing it. One thing I didn't ask, what's the one thing you'd like your readers to get from &quot;The Sound of Gravel&quot;?</strong></p>\n<p>I think for me, for readers it would be most important...for them to be able to reflect on their own lives and to find the gratitude in themselves and to hopefully resonate with that part of me that was strong and resilient and in spite of my situation, to realize that we all have that in us and in spite of how difficult circumstances can become, we don't have to be a victim of it, that we can rise above it, not that it's easy because I don't want to make it seem like it's easy to do that, but that we can, that we have the power to do that. I think that one thing that people have - what I've gotten, responses from early readers is that by me telling my story, in a very vulnerable way, it opens the door for my readers to share their stories in vulnerable ways and I think that can be very important and healing. I tell them just a little bit about the story just when I'm talking about the book and they open up like &quot;ohh this happened to my mom and I heard that story so many times and I had to do this when I was 15,&quot; and you know so I think it opens the door for that which ultimately opens the door for healing, so even if it's just a small spark of healing I think that would be pretty amazing.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have plans to write more books?</strong></p>\n<p>I would love to - I've thought about things I've started writing scenes and it kind of all depends on how the next couple of years play out - I hope to be able to, yes.</p>\n","cover_img":"663x400_RuthWarinerBook.jpg","post_img":"663x400_RuthWarinerBook.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Ruth Wariner","youtube_link":null,"live_date":"2016-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":""},{"id":37,"title":"<p>The Friendly Way to Get Free Books</p>\n","subtitle":"<p>Want free books?

What hit me the hardest in 2015 was Jill Leovy's 'Ghettoside'. It's just the sort of thing I go for: an exhaustively researched non-fiction account of people I know nothing about. When those people are from India, as in Katherine Boo's 'Beyond The Beautiful Forevers' one can sort of be forgiven, but in 'Ghettoside', as in Adrian Nicole LeBlanc's masterful 'Random Family', the strangers are Americans. They live in our towns, but in another part. The part we avoid, most likely.</p>\n<p>This book focuses on the 77th Division of South Central Los Angeles, and follows a number of homicide detectives tasked with solving gang-related murders, the kind buried deep inside the newspaper, or perhaps not mentioned at all. In preparing this recommendation, I read a number of reviews. All of them were positive, and praised the author's reportorial skills. They put the book in context, mentioning the murders of Michael Brown and the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement. They made it sound important, which it is, and wise. What they left out,  and what I so enjoyed about Ghettoside, is that it reads like a novel. It's meticulously paced and the writing frequently stopped me cold.</p>\n<p>What I most loved was how it challenged my expectations. Why had I thought that the detectives—most of them white— wouldn't care that some gang member was murdered, or that the families of the victims, people to whom gun violence is an everyday event, would accept the deaths of their teenagers without anger or grief, as simply par for the course? Like all great books, this one leaves you thinking, not just &quot;Who are they,&quot; but also &quot;Who am I?&quot;</p>\n<p>Many of the reviews I read recommended the book as medicine, a disservice, I thought, as it's so enthralling. I feel bad using that word when these are real people, and they're suffering so horribly. It's to the author's credit that 'Ghettoside' is so hard to put down, and that you wind up caring for everyone involved. When killers are caught, you don't feel victorious so much as sad. Another life wasted. Unlike a detective novel where you think, &quot;Well, that happened,&quot; here there's the sense of the grinding wheel, one gang-related murder after another. On and on and on. It's relentless and brutal, and Jill Leovy's account of it is art.&quot;</p>\n","cover_img":"663x400_NotesSedaris.jpg","post_img":"663x400_NotesSedaris.jpg","author":"David Sedaris","youtube_link":null,"live_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p>Our January Guest Judge, the hilarious and observant David Sedaris, selected <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=94\">'Ghettoside'</a> by Jill Leovy.

His book had me hooked within the first paragraph.  Dan really has a wonderful talent brilliantly displayed in the way that he is able to put so much of himself into his words.  As profane as it was at times that just made it all the more real to me.  A couple of years back I was taking classes to become a CNA (Certified Nurses Aide) where I did hands on work at an nursing home where I met and cared for patients who were living with ALS and other incapacitating illnesses.  During the time I was caring for them I met so many of their family members and saw first hand how much love and compassion we can hold for our loved ones.  But no matter how much love you can give, sometimes the best thing for everyone to hear is a well placed fart joke or a couple of well meant curses!  Like Dan says at the end of the book where he reveals that part of the proceeds earned from the sales of the book goes to the ALS Association, &quot;Thanks, and f*ck Lou Gehrig's Disease!&quot;.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any particular Judges who you follow?</strong>\n<br>\nJudge Kim Hubbard has been pumping out amazing selections the past couple months, and I really can't wait to see what she picks out next!</p>\n<p><strong>What do you like the most about Book of the Month?</strong>\n<br>\nIt's so hard to pick just one thing I like most about Book of the Month, and why should I?

It really makes the entire experience come to life, there is nothing else quite like nerding out with people who understand your obsession with books, because I don't think my boyfriend will ever understand why I'm jumping up and down from excitement the second week of every month when my book arrives, to be honest!</p>\n<p><strong>Anything else you'd like to share?</strong>\n<br>\nBook of the Month Club is such a wonderful subscription service.

Do you think reading should play a larger role in people's resolutions?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely.  Reading is good for you — research proves what many booklovers have\nlong intuited. Study after study has shown that reading improves memory;\nheightens social skills of empathy and understanding; improves self-esteem and\nfeelings of connection to others; lowers levels of the stress hormone cortisol (just\nfive minutes of reading will do the trick but the more the better); and staves off\nAlzheimer's while making the reader smarter and ready to connect more and more\nbrain synapses.</p>\n<p>But even if reading didn't do all these wonderful things for my brain, my morale, and\nmy ability to be a good human being, I would still always make sure I make time to\nread. Because reading brings me joy.  Joy in making new friends (characters in\nbooks); discovering new places (I might never get to); experiencing new things\n(safely); and trying out new ideas (bourbon as the great American drink?). Reading\nalso helps with the resolution to exercise more — I find it much easier to ride a\nstationary bike or climb the endless stairs of the Stairmaster if I am reading a great\nbook at the same time.  But I have to admit that when I read a book like any of those\nby Louise Penny, who does such a wonderful job describing food and drinks, I\nalways end up making my way to the kitchen to fix a snack... .</p>\n<p><strong>What's your 2016 New Year's Reading Resolution?</strong></p>\n<p>In 2016 I resolve to read more nonfiction (I tend to bury myself in long fiction) and\nto find new intellectually satisfying ''cozies'' to read. Cozies are murder mysteries\nthat are big on atmosphere and characters and pay less attention to blood or thrills\nor chills — but so many of the cozies coming out these days are written for ninnies.<br />\nTwo delightful cozy series, which I just discovered, are the Jenn McKinlay library\nmysteries and the Shadows Antique Print mysteries by Lea Wait. I hope to find more\ngreat cozies in 2016.</p>\n<p>As far as nonfiction goes, Book of the Month offers wonderful selections I never\nwould have found or selected on my own but which I've loved, including one of my\nfavorite books from last year, <em>Gironimo: Riding the Very Terrible 1914 Tour of Italy</em>\nby Tim Moore. And yes, bourbon is the great American drink, as I learned from\n<em>Bourbon Empire: the Past and Future of America's Whiskey</em> by Reid Mitenbuler,\nanother Book of the Month selection.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is reading so important to you?</strong></p>\n<p>Reading saved me at a time when I had become lost.  My sister died at the age of 46\nand all of a sudden I wondered what living without her could look like for me — it seemed impossible. But reading showed me how to live on, looking backwards with\nmy memories of her and moving forwards as I discovered new ways of being in the\nworld without her.  Reading was quite simply my therapy back to a connected,\nmeaningful, and satisfying life. Even now, whenever I feel stressed or cranky or\nunhappy, I know that if I just sit down and let myself sink into a good book, I will\nend up calmer, happier, and ready to take on life again. I always carry a book with\nme, so that my lifesaver is always there. Joy, escape, comfort: all in the pages of a\nbook.</p>\n","cover_img":"botm-magazine-sanko.jpg","post_img":"botm-magazine-sanko.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Nina Sankovitch","youtube_link":null,"live_date":"2015-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p>We sat down with Judge Nina Sankovitch, who once spent a year reading a book a day to cope with the loss of her sister.

We asked <em>The Magician's Lie</em> author, Greer Macallister, about writing, book comparisons, Hollywood actresses, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>What was your reaction when you found out your debut novel was selected by Guest Judge Whoopi Goldberg as her Book of the Month?</strong></p>\n<p>Blown away! I might have danced around the room a bit. Hearing it was chosen was great, but to hear who it was chosen by — someone whose career I've been following for years and years now, since the Comic Relief specials of the 1980s — was just unbelievable.</p>\n<p><strong>Whoopi asked you a question about your inspiration for the character The Amazing Arden. Was Arden based on any particular magicians you researched?</strong></p>\n<p>Arden herself wasn't inspired by any real-life figures, but one magician who turned up in my research absolutely had to go in the book — Adelaide Herrmann. She was her husband's assistant until he died suddenly, and then she took over his act and delivered on the bookings he'd promised: starting with the Bullet Catch, the deadliest illusion in professional magic. When I read about that, I knew it had to be included in the book, and it becomes the event that changes the direction of Arden's life.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite magician's illusion after conducting your research?</strong></p>\n<p>The Herrmanns did an illusion called &quot;The Slave Girl's Dream,&quot; a variation on levitation, one of the most common illusions. A woman appears to be hovering parallel to the ground. Seems simple, right? But the reason I find it so impressive is that it's physically very challenging. There's a giant steel truss under the woman's garments, with an adjustable metal pole running up to the armpit. So her whole body is held up by that pole, and it must be very painful. But for the illusion to work, she has to look like she's not putting forth any effort at all.</p>\n<p><strong>Your book has been compared to <em>Water for Elephants</em>. Do you agree with that comparison? Why or why not?</strong></p>\n<p>I absolutely adore Water for Elephants, so I like it! It's also a lot to live up to. Comparisons can be useful for readers, and if you say, 'Oh, this is like Water for Elephants, if you like historical fiction following a traveling show, and there's a love story in it,' that can be helpful. But one book is never exactly like another, so there's always a little danger in any comparison.</p>\n<p><strong>If your novel were turned into a film, are there any actresses you would want to portray Arden?</strong></p>\n<p>Such a hard question! I'd be so excited to see this on the screen, I can't even tell you. When I was writing the book, I had Mia Wasikowska in mind, but I did an online book club chat a few months back where one reader suggested Jessica Chastain, and now that's who I picture. I think she'd be incredible.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us about the writing process for historical fiction? What kind of research did you need to conduct about that time period (the turn of the 20th century)?</strong></p>\n<p>I'd never written historical fiction before, so I really was making up the process as I went along. The research was so engrossing at first it was really getting in the way of the writing. So I had to designate separate blocks of time, as writing time or researching time. I had romantic notions that I'd be poring over dusty old materials in the library, and while I did some of that, mostly my research was internet-based. Finding the details isn't the hard part — it's deciding what to use. If I described what people were wearing and eating and how they got around in every single scene, there wouldn't be much room for the rest of the story. It's really about balance.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have plans to write more historical fiction novels?</strong></p>\n<p>I do! Every idea I've had since finishing TML falls into the &quot;bad ass women of history&quot; category, which I find exciting and inspiring. So next up is a book about Kate Warne, the first female Pinkerton detective, who was hired by Allan Pinkerton himself in 1856 in Chicago. It's called GIRL IN DISGUISE and I believe Sourcebooks is planning a release date in early 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>What's the most interesting question you received from a reader on your book tour?</strong></p>\n<p>On a Skype book club just last week, one reader had a question about what had happened to a character who features heavily in the early part of the book, but disappears thereafter. But it wasn't just her question, which was what had happened to the character — she had sort of a whole alt-history of what she thought might have happened to her and why, and I was really amazed and impressed by that.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any questions you want to be asked but haven't been?</strong></p>\n<p>No one asks whether it's really safe to have a tiger hanging out on your porch, as happens in one memorable scene, but I'm OK with that. I think it means they believe that this tiger would do what this tiger does, in context.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you currently working on anything else?</strong></p>\n<p>Writing GIRL IN DISGUISE is my main focus right now, and I've got some ideas percolating for another book beyond that … all in good time.</p>\n<p><strong>What books are you reading now?</strong></p>\n<p>I just finished an advance copy of Ariel Lawhon's amazing FLIGHT OF DREAMS, about the Hindenburg disaster — I think it comes out in February. So good. Now I'm reading THE STORIED LIFE OF A.J. FIKRY, which is so charming, by Gabrielle Zevin. Next up is Mary Kubica's thriller PRETTY BABY — I loved THE GOOD GIRL so I suspect this one will also hit the spot.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Greer will be answering member questions on the <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/discussions.html\">Discussions</a> section from January 20th – January 22nd.

But when you're online, you're a total dick. I know when you're typing away on social media or adding to the comments section you feel like a righteous person, defending the environment, or animal rights or veterans. But, actually—total dick.</p>\n<p>Which is why you need to read Jon Ronson's <em>So You've Been Publicly Shamed</em>. Normally, I prefer reading about how other people are bad. A good Pol Pot biography, maybe, or some morally compromised Jonathan Franzen characters. But Jon Ronson's <em>So You've Been Publicly Shamed</em> is about how <em>I'm</em> bad, which, it turns out, is much more interesting, since it's about me.</p>\n<p>It taught me—and hopefully will teach you—how to stop being a jerk by continuing a tradition of jerkishness Ronson traces back to the Colonial-era jerks who put people in stockades, like jerks. Ronson provides a correction to the virtual mob rule that is ruining many non-virtual lives today. For instance, I have no doubt that anyone who reads this book would hold off from going online to rip apart that Minnesota dentist who killed Cecil the Lion. I, for instance, am restraining from doing so right here.</p>\n<p>Ronson visits with lots of people whose lives were ruined when they became social media's Villain Of The Week, including Justine Sacco, the publicist I've felt a lingering guilt about ever since I was too afraid to write a column defending the harmless AIDS joke she tweeted that ended her career and, I learned, her dating life.</p>\n<p>He's somehow able to make us feel awful while still entertaining us. Ronson is a funny, self-effacing, neurotically self-aware, overly trustworthy narrator who spends just slightly more time investigating the emotional wreckage of his subjects than he does investigating the emotional wreckage he experiences thinking about his subjects. He begins the book with stories where he shamed others with liberal righteousness, and follows them with his own fury at being the victim of a social media attack. The two great things we learn about in this book are: what it's like to live in an age of online mob rule; and, what it's like to be Jon Ronson. And they're nearly equally interesting.</p>\n<p>As a person who has written cruel things about people in my columns and had cruel things written about me online, the latter of which I remember far better, I was furious at myself for not writing this book before Ronson did. But I also know he did a far better job than I would have. And, as much as my jealousy is fueling me to do so, I'm not going to write about how much more pleasurable it is to read this in print than to listen to his nasally voice on audiobook. It's really hard to stop this shaming thing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=86\">See more about <em>So You've Been Publicly Shamed</em></a></p>\n","cover_img":"BOM_Mag_Joel1.jpg","post_img":"BOM_Mag_Joel1.jpg","author":"Joel Stein","youtube_link":null,"live_date":"2015-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":""},{"id":14,"title":"<p>Joel Stein's Guide to Masculinity and Humor</p>\n","subtitle":"<p>Find out how our November Guest Judge embarrassed himself in front of George Clooney</p>\n","summary":"<p><strong>1. Are you related to Ben Stein?  (Bueller?... Bueller?? Bueller?)</strong></p>\n<p>No. But I did interview him once and he befriended me. His dad had just died and he cried during the interview, so I think that, plus the same last names, and the fact that he started as a columnist, and I did some TV appearances, made him feel bonded to me. So we went out to dinner with our wives once. We're not that similar. But I liked him.</p>\n<p><strong>2. You've written over 500 columns for Time Magazine. Which one is your favorite?</strong></p>\n<p>Whatever one people liked the most. I am all ego and no inner compass. Maybe when my wife eats her placenta? Though I have a soft spot for the one where I proposed to her.</p>\n<p><strong>3. In 2013 you wrote a cover story for Time Magazine called the &quot;Me Me Me Generation&quot; in which you called Millennials (people age 15 to 35) narcissistic, over-confident and self-involved. Two years later, has your perspective changed?</strong></p>\n<p>Not at all. The fact that so many Millennials got personally offended by it (I can't imagine any Gen Xer caring that Slackers made us look bad) made me more sure about those facts.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Your book <em>Man Made: A Stupid Quest for Masculinity</em> describes your exploits hanging out with firemen, working in a machine shop and joining the Army (for a few days). Did any of these activities actually succeed in making you more manly?</strong></p>\n<p>To my surprise: Yes. It also made me more comfortable around men. I can ask very specific questions about boot camp, UFC, cars, boy scouts, football and day trading now. And that's all you need.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Teddy Roosevelt vs. Jason Bourne:  ¿Quien es mas macho?</strong></p>\n<p>Theodore Roosevelt. I'd like to see you call him &quot;Teddy&quot; to his face.

Where do you think Nicole learned to write so well?</strong></p>\n<p>I know it wasn't from her freshman year writing tutor, which was me. She didn't exactly come to me for essay help. She was already writing poetry that famous poets were recognizing. I thought they were creepy old men who thought she was cute, and I told her so. [[[I was a dick.]]]</p>\n<p><strong>7. You also taught a humor class at Princeton.  Can you actually teach people how to be funny?</strong></p>\n<p>Totally. It's just math. Funny people have just been doing that math a long time, usually because if they didn't, they would have gotten beaten up.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Who is your favorite comedian?</strong></p>\n<p>Right now at this moment? Amy Schumer is really good right now. So is Louis C.K. I just saw Mike Birbiglia and was surprised at just how good he's gotten.</p>\n<p><strong>9. When you had George Clooney over to your house for dinner, what did you cook for him?</strong></p>\n<p>The spaghetti carbonara and salad were good, but I kept having to put the mustard-crusted rack of lamb back in the oven.

There is a person in the world who understands me so intimately and so terribly well, and it is this person who gave me this book.</p>\n<p><em>The History of Love</em> works so incredibly well as a piece of literary artistry because it taps into some of the greatest tension we as readers can experience, and it makes us fall in love. Krauss creates a character in Leo Gursky who we need to understand and who is so very hard to understand. That tension between what we know and what we want to know keeps us riveted. And she creates in Alma a character so in need of being understood, and yet so beyond understanding that the tension is magnified. It is this dual tension that fuels the novel.</p>\n<p>The story of a story unfolding is also what <em>The History of Love</em> is about. It is a search for an answer, and we not only go on the journey of the search but we are participants in watching the searcher search. It is the ultimate multi-dimensional novel in this sense: we watch a watcher watching. We struggle to watch a struggler struggling. We become a part of the novel without even realizing it. This book became a part of me as I read it and for a long time after.</p>\n<p>Any novel that has twists and turns cannot really be written about; it needs to be experienced. The experience I had allowing this novel to unravel into a perfect pile of chaos and meaning was a transformative one as a reader and as a lover of literature. The process of watching a novel grow before your eyes as you turn the pages is spectacular.</p>\n<p><em>The History of Love</em> changed my life because of the way it made me believe. It made me believe in friendship all over again, and it made me believe in literature too. But mostly, this novel made me believe all over again in the promise of love.</p>\n<p>Through history, we learn. <em>The History of Love</em> chronicles the way we learn to trust, to understand, and to love. In this way, we become a part of history.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=82\">See more about <em>The History of Love</em></a></p>\n","cover_img":"BOM_Mag_MayimBialik.jpg","post_img":"BOM_Mag_MayimBialik.jpg","author":"Mayim Bialik","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2015-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":""}],"postsLength":14,"member":null,"members":{"active":[{"id":0,"image":"Mee.jpg","name":"Mee","town":"Sacramento, CA","quote":"Getting around to reading all these books I got...for every book I read, I somehow manage to buy like 3 more lol #readingislife #bookofthemonth #botm #bookstagram","books":[178,172,139,174,168,140,117]},{"id":1,"image":"ShelbyBMember.jpg","name":"Shelby","town":"Bentonville, AR","quote":"So excited to receive my July #bookofthemonth in the mail today from the @bookofthemonthclub 🎉 - now excuse me while I get lost in the pages for a few days 📖🤓📚💕"},{"id":2,"image":"Anna.jpg","name":"Anna","town":"Marietta, GA","quote":"Crazy weeks call for lazy Sundays like this.

Eleven</em>, the global population is decimated by a virus known as the Georgia Flu. 95–99% of humanity is wiped out, almost overnight. Those who caught the virus were dead within twenty-four hours. Entire countries flicker, then blink out of existence. Those who remain are left waiting for help and begin to wander aimlessly when none arrives, hoping that someone who can make any kind of sense out of the madness is waiting farther down the road.</p>\n<p>The novel follows the lives of several loosely connected survivors. When we meet them, the central characters are all attending or participating in a production of King Lear in Toronto on the night the pandemic starts. Kirsten is a child actress waiting in the wings, Arthur the star of the show…until he drops dead of a stroke mid-monologue. Jeevan, an EMT, rushes on stage in an unsuccessful attempt to save his life. The book splits from there, and we follow these characters and those surrounding them back and forth across the years—sometimes experiencing the present along with them, sometimes retrospectively gazing at the past.</p>\n<p>It is in these moments and portraits of individual lives that Mandel shines. In a new world where no one can count on their next sunrise, Mandel reflects on what makes us human, what we use to define ourselves when there is nothing left. She answers these big questions by moving the reader through time, giving equal importance to Kirsten’s struggle to survive the dangerous new road fifteen years after the virus as she does to Arthur’s life as a celebrity in the many years prior, weaving it all together to show that global devastation cannot overpower the strength of human action, love, pain, and hope.</p>\n<p>At its core, the book holds and follows the Traveling Symphony—a group of actors and musicians who wander along a set route between various encampments, the closest thing to towns and cities it seems this fractured new world will ever be able to achieve. The troupe members bring classical music and battered copies of Shakespeare’s plays with them, traveling under a banner that reads <em>“because survival is insufficient”</em> as they attempt to spread what beauty remains.</p>\n<p>This book is rich, deep, beautiful, and terrifying. Beautiful in its flowing, intelligent prose that draws the reader in so deeply that when I looked up from a page, I half expected Mandel’s world to be the one surrounding me. Terrifying in its closeness because there is nothing about this book that seems unrealistic or too far of a reach when you step away from it and examine the world around you.</p>\n<p>If nine out of ten people that you know were gone when you woke up tomorrow, if your cell phone stopped working, if your car ran out of gas, if all flights were grounded and all infrastructure crumbled, what would you do? Mandel answers that question for you by taking you on the road, carrying you along with those who choose to stay at the first settlement they encounter out of fear and with those who press on out of a need for this to not be the final, unsatisfying answer. Some choose to hold onto every possible vestige of the life they knew before along with those who block out all memories from the years surrounding the outbreak. Prophets heralding a new judged earth attempt to have their way with and subdue anyone who will listen. Men, women, and children seek love, comfort, and safety wherever they can find it. Wouldn’t you do the same?</p>\n<p>Mandel’s breathtaking, yet attainable and effortless prose evoked every feeling I’ve ever had about humanity. All at once, she made me realize the duality and cohabitation of triviality and significance in every choice, word, and moment of human life. Mandel’s novel is sweeping and dramatic. It renders nothing insignificant but fits it all into the larger scheme—the elusive grand plan that boils down to this: life is not promised, so make yours a good one.</p>\n<p><em>“I stood looking over my damaged home and tried to forget the sweetness of life on Earth.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Do you remember when we were young and gorgeous? Clark wanted to ask. Do you remember when everything seemed limitless?”</em></p>\n","img":"StationEleven.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>This book is rich, deep, beautiful, and terrifying.

Because even a hint of light, any kind of light, feels like a blowtorch held against your skin, you banish every wisp of it. Could you survive that? How long before you went mad?</p>\n<p>Anna Lyndsey's haunting and lyrically gorgeous narrative imagines just that scenario. Except that it is not an imagining; it is real life, a nightmare that she lives with every day. Lyndsey's extreme light sensitivity, caused by an unknown culprit, goes from nonexistent to annoying to bad to worse, as she falls down a rabbit hole of light-blocking clothing (velvet and high-quality black felt are best) and endless black days of listening to audiobooks. Even eating in a light just bright enough to make out the food on her plate is an excruciating experience.</p>\n<p>As unreal as her story seems, as heartbreaking and terrifying as her disease is, Lyndsey's story is filled with moments of poignant and hopeful joy. She invents games that can be played in the dark, becomes inventively resourceful, and finds beauty in the things that most of us rarely notice anymore. In a rare moment of remission, she stands outside in a rain storm and glories in the mere fact of nature being nature.</p>\n<p>Throughout, her relationship with her boyfriend Pete is a constant. Pete, as a photographer who is captivated by light, is juxtaposed with Anna, and the truly heartbreaking moments of Anna's memoir are those when she wonders if she is trapping him, handcuffing him to a half-lived life with her, because he is too much of a good guy to end it.</p>\n<p>Anna Lyndsey's memoir opens the door to not just a life without light, but really, instructions to a life lived in the dark.

Geronimo Johnson holds a mirror up to classic American stereotypes on both sides of the political spectrum and forces readers to examine themselves and their own biases. Whip smart and timely in its examination of racial and cultural tension, this novel examines the law of unintended consequences while maintaining a uniquely and hilariously light touch.</p>\n<p>D'aron Davenport is a &quot;Really Nice Guy&quot; from Braggsville, GA (population 712). Looking for experiences beyond his rural, Southern hometown, D'aron heads off to college at ultra-liberal UC Berkeley, where the quirky personalities he encounters ensures he gets more &quot;experience&quot; than he bargained for. When D'aron's strident new friends learn of the yearly Civil War reenactment that is staged in his hometown, they see it as a perfect opportunity to stage a &quot;performative intervention,&quot; a sort of performance protest, to express their indignation at what they consider an archaic and offensive event.</p>\n<p>Fueled by a mission of social justice, they travel to Braggsville over spring break, their paths lit by their shining naiveté. Under the thrall of the group and the Berkeley bubble, even D'aron is blind to the chance that their interruption might be unwelcome. As their trip descends into catastrophe, with life altering consequences, the group is confronted by their collectively idealistic point of view, reflected in the face of well-meaning (if not ignorant) citizens.</p>\n<p>Johnson's satire shines a light on the absurdity and extremism of both the politically over-correct and the culturally oblivious characters that populate the real world, and in doing so, urges both sides to embrace rationality and empathy instead.</p>\n<p>Employing innovative and exciting prose, Johnson creates a narrative voice and a tone that will have you cheering, thankful that there still exists such fresh new ways to form sentences and express ideas.

The animal, an elusive resident of a remote, protected mountainous region between Laos and Vietnam, was unknown to western science prior to May 1992 when naturists saw its horns mounted in an indigenous hunter's hut. The parallels between the saola and the mythical unicorn don't stop just with the horns; you're pretty much just as likely to see one as the other in the wild.</p>\n<p>And that's exactly what scientists William deBuys and William Rochibaud, along with a team of Lao naturalists, set out to do—to record and observe a saola in its native habitat. No easy task, between untrustworthy and ill-tempered hired guides, Vietnamese poachers, rapidly dwindling financial reserves, an inhospitable environment, and deBuys' (self-admitted) past-prime physical state.

She spent her days clicking buttons on her mouse, moving material from her mind, to her screen, and then on to the immense internet void. Tailoring content and clicking, clicking, clicking… In her years as a journalist in Boston, the industry had migrated from carefully crafted articles for actual paying subscribers to short-form &quot;digital content&quot;—quick bites for a younger, plugged-in demographic.  Disillusioned with the state of her career, and the state of her soul, MacLaughlin desperately craved a new direction.</p>\n<p>Despite having no experience, she answers a Craigslist ad seeking a carpenter's assistant—<em>women strongly urged to apply</em>. So begins a journey of discovery, away from the digital, ephemeral life of her past, and into the tangible, physical, concrete (sometimes literally) life of a carpenter. Clicking gives way to hammer blows, typing to screaming saws, research to whirring drills. And in this well-crafted memoir, MacLaughlin illuminates not only her transformation into a skilled carpenter's assistant, but also into a woman and a new way of inhabiting the world.</p>\n<p>Making the switch from a life of letters to a life of tools and wood and sweat, MacLaughlin aligns these two worlds with a deft hand, a curious eye, and an ear for language that shows the beauty in all things. A piece of wood, in MacLaughlin's hands, takes on a translatable sensory experience that the reader shares in: the smell, the weight, the feel of it. MacLaughlin is a student of carpentry and a master of language.</p>\n<p>This book is ultimately a meditation on craft: the craft of words and the craft of raw materials. And while she acknowledges the similarities between writing and building, MacLaughlin also makes clear the stark differences between crafting sentences and crafting homes. She has moved from the intangible to the tangible, the mental to the physical, and though there's a blur, a smudge where the two worlds fuse as she moves between them, it is clear that in her new life, she is both building and being built in a way she never could have imagined.</p>\n","img":"HammerHead.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>Making the switch from a life of letters to a life of tools and wood and sweat, MacLaughlin aligns these two worlds with a deft hand, a curious eye, and an ear for language that shows the beauty in all things.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":2,"visible":true,"judge_id":1,"store_id":1,"in_stock":false,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":12,"authors":[52]},"51":{"id":51,"mmid":1403136,"title":"See How Small","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":3,"year":0,"pages":224,"description_title":"One Horrific Crime Rocks a Small Town","description":"<p>&quot;We have always lived here, though we pretend we've just arrived.&quot;—I was drawn into Scott Blackwood's novel <em>See How Small</em> by the very first sentence: A simple sentence but one that promises mystery, obfuscation, surprise. Three young women are brutally murdered in a small town, and the duplicity is everywhere, in all the lies told by those left behind. Blackwood's precise and crystalline prose gave me immediate and intense entry into a world that should have horrified me, but instead surrounded me willingly in its layers of grief, anger, denial, and survival.</p>\n<p>Not only is the atmosphere of horror and aftermath so perfectly evoked by Blackwood's writing, but so also is the atmosphere of the landscapes: the ice cream shop where the girls are killed; the small Texas town where they lived; the cold blight of winter in Chicago, sought out by one of the criminals in a final bid for absolution.

His quest to find the baby's mother sets in motion a Dickens-worthy plot of intrigue and deception, fear and heroism, love and forgiveness. Populated with fascinating and endearing secondary characters, the resulting adventure is fantastic and absorbing, filled with macabre details, hair-raising twists and heartbreaking turns, and a showdown so unexpected and wonderful that I had to read it twice.</p>\n<p><em>Church of Marvels</em> is a book of marvels, offering as main attraction a fantastic story of lost souls and found loves, along with plenty of wondrous side shows involving unforgettable characters and eerie landscapes, and delivering a powerful and exciting conclusion. Parry's readers are left satisfied and even more, enriched, by her profound observations on the eternal questions of identity, fate, and self-determination.</p>\n","img":"ChurchOfMarvels.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>Fantastic and absorbing, filled with macabre details, hair-raising twists and heartbreaking turns, and a showdown so unexpected and wonderful that I had to read it twice.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":1,"visible":true,"judge_id":2,"store_id":1,"in_stock":true,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":14,"authors":[55]},"54":{"id":54,"mmid":1403435,"title":"The Sympathizer","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":4,"year":0,"pages":384,"description_title":"Spy vs. Himself: Torn Loyalties and a Communist Double Agent","description":"<p>Occasionally a book comes along that you can't believe hasn't already been written. <em>The Sympathizer</em> is just such a book: an intellectual spy novel about the end of the Vietnam War that is, in equal parts, a thriller, a portrait of Republican Vietnamese in defeat and exile, and a psychological novel about the varieties of ambivalence thoughtful people must endure when living through complicated times. The book is addictive and compelling and mysterious all at the same time.</p>\n<p>The narrator, who manages his confession quite well without a name, is a Communist double agent in the entourage of a defeated South Vietnamese General. His position is complicated by his status as half-Vietnamese, half-European and his problem is that he loves everyone. He loves Vietnam and wants it to be free. He loves America and all its luxury and frankness. He loves Communism and all its magnificent idealism. He loves capitalism and its gorgeous vapid consumerism. In long letters describing his new life in California to his Communist handler, the descriptions are testaments both to the beauty of America, and simultaneously to his dedication to serving its enemies. His fellow feeling extends to everyone and he never seems quite sure of whom he wants to betray or why. He never quite seems sure whom he belongs to and who belongs to him. And all these overlaid contradiction make for fascinating reading.</p>\n<p>The spy's position makes him an ideal observer for a novel. He notes every detail with supreme cynicism and attention. Even the carpet of the office of Chair of Asian Studies becomes a grim political point: &quot;He had hung an elaborate Oriental rug on his wall, in lieu, I suppose, of an actual Oriental.&quot; The thrill of <em>The Sympathizer</em> is in the sympathy, which becomes a surprisingly dangerous emotion. For a guy who sides with everybody and nobody, the inevitable question is which side will he end up on. The deeper question is: does it matter?

Let's see, there's the Earth, of course. And dirt. Possibly Abe Vigoda. That's about it. And it's not as if there are existing black-and-white photos of Rain when it was just a drizzle in diapers, standing on a lawn with its parents, the Clouds, shaking its lightning bolt rattle.</p>\n<p>As we all know, and California is unfortunately experiencing for itself right now, rain is one of the most necessary things for our planet. I applaud Cynthia Barnett's ambition in taking on such a broad subject. After all, rain isn't something you can readily sit down and interview. It can be elusive. It happens, or it decidedly doesn't happen, and both courses can cause great growth or despair, which you can find detailed in this book.</p>\n<p>Did you know that there were torrential rains for thousands of years when the Earth was first formed? (You thought Seattle was bad.) Or that Thomas Jefferson was a big supporter of weather forecasting? Or that the Assyrians invented the first umbrellas? I could go on about rain for days, with all this book taught me.</p>\n<p>From page one, Barnett deftly weaves rain-related literary references in with discussions about climate change, droughts, flood and the rain forest. (I hadn't noticed how often Ray Bradbury references rain in his work, and as a huge Bradbury fan, seeing all the information laid out in one place was a nerdy treat.) There's talk of witchcraft, kings, the Bible, and Shakespeare, along with scientific facts about rain that are in no way boring or tedious to read. This book will have you turning to the person next to you every few minutes, saying, &quot;Hey, did you know…&quot;</p>\n<p>Suffice to say, I adored this book. I even found myself feeling a little verklempt reading it. Barnett does a lovely job of imparting to the reader a sense of awe and wonder. What a remarkable thing rain is! And it happens right here, right where we live! Rain rivals any biography where the subject has a more discernible origin story, and I'd recommend it to any inhabitant of our planet.</p>\n","img":"Rain.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>Rain happens, or it decidedly doesn't happen, and both courses can cause great growth or despair.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":3,"visible":true,"judge_id":4,"store_id":1,"in_stock":false,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":7,"authors":[57]},"56":{"id":56,"mmid":1403439,"title":"Lacy Eye","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":4,"year":0,"pages":352,"description_title":"A Father Brutally Murdered &mdash; Could His Daughter Be to Blame?","description":"<p>First, a bit of context about my relationship with the bad seed genre: I read <em>We Need to Talk About Kevin</em> in one sitting, my baby son dozing sweetly in my lap while I lost myself in the world of one of fiction's most notoriously violent teens. When the movie came out, I went by myself to a 10PM screening where I shared a pitch-black theater with a lone man who laughed uproariously when the tip of an arrow pierced the flesh of its first victim. At that moment, I feared for my own safety—and started to question my enthusiasm for books about kids gone wrong.</p>\n<p>Now, thanks to the arrival of <em>Lacy Eye</em>, I'm right back in the saddle—and more appreciative than ever of my own garden-variety offspring who aren't even remotely interested in archery or croquet (more on this later).</p>\n<p>Just as <em>We Need to Talk About Kevin</em> is a now-classic tale of a mom trying to make sense of her son's murderous rampage, Jessica Treadway's second novel comes to us from the perspective of a mother whose child has never been quite…right. When we meet Hanna, she's recovering from injuries sustained in a brutal attack where her husband, Joe, was bludgeoned to death in the bed next to her with a croquet mallet. In the aftermath Hanna struggles to understand: who would do this to an average accountant and his kind-hearted wife? All evidence points to Rud Petty, the charming boyfriend of Hanna and Joe's daughter, Dawn.</p>\n<p>As Hannah works to surface buried memories from that night, she must confront the possibility that Dawn might have been central to the attack. Treadway's thoughtful mystery gathers steam through interviews, court papers and Hanna's flashbacks to an ordinary time that suddenly doesn't seem so ordinary at all. Watching her lift the curtain from her own memory is the central pleasure of reading this book. You're rooting for clarity even as you know that the cloudy view is sparing her the worst kind of heartbreak.</p>\n<p>Discovering more than she ever wanted to know, Hanna bravely confronts truths about her own life and her children that would leave any mother heartbroken. A tense psychological thriller, the novel teasingly doles out snippets of information, keeping you as much in the dark its characters are.

Accused of murdering two children when he was only 14, after having been released from juvenile detention for torturing several other children, his guilt is rarely in question (except by his mother).  It's not a question of whodunit, it's a question of why. That is the driving force behind the story; that and, how many children will die before the killer is caught?</p>\n<p>Just as Erik Larsen connected the wider context of Chicago to his killer in <em>The Devil in the White City</em>, so too does Roseanne Montillo connect Pomeroy to Boston.  Uniting multiple events and personalities from the time and place in which Pomeroy acted — including the Great Fire of 1872, Herman Melville's own struggle with mental illness, and the legal interest of Oliver Wendell Holmes — Montillo paints not only a portrait of a killer but also a portrait of a city. Setting the rubberneck-inducing account of a horrific crime spree against a distinctive historical setting, the book is at its core a gripping chronicle of a boy gone wrong.</p>\n<p>Madness, as presented in <em>The Wilderness of Ruin</em>, is not only a brain dysfunction; the fire of this particular case of madness is fueled by abuse, class separation, governmental neglect, media sensationalism and community fervor. Madness, Montillo suggests, is a product of situation, and she questions what the word — in 1870s America — meant.</p>\n<p>Jesse Pomeroy is a terrifying and yet strangely compelling subject, to be sure. The descriptions of his crimes gave me chills, gruesome as they are, and his indifference to the suffering of his victims is just as horrifying. By telling the story of Pomeroy and the story of Boston in the late 1800s, the idea that society can exacerbate or even cause craziness kept me flipping pages long into the late hours of the night.</p>\n<p>In the same way Boston society was gripped by the unbelievable particulars of Pomeroy's murders, I was enthralled by the smallest of details and dying for the answer to the question, &quot;What became of Jesse Pomeroy?&quot;</p>\n","img":"TheWildernessOfRuin.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>[A] rubberneck-inducing account of a horrific crime spree… a gripping chronicle of a boy gone wrong.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":5,"visible":true,"judge_id":1,"store_id":1,"in_stock":false,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":5,"authors":[59]},"58":{"id":58,"mmid":1403783,"title":"The Unraveling of Mercy Louis","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":5,"year":0,"pages":336,"description_title":"Scandal Shines the Spotlight on High School's Girls ","description":"<p><em>The Unraveling of Mercy Louis</em> is both a study of a milieu that we rarely encounter in fiction — a devoutly religious refinery town on the Texas coast — and an impeccably rendered depiction of the strains of adolescence and the complications of family and friendship.</p>\n<p>The novel opens with a gruesome discovery that becomes an overnight scandal. As local police and politicians contend with increasing public pressure to find the perpetrator, suspicion turns on the girls in the local high school, who quickly find themselves under an intolerable microscope.</p>\n<p>The story moves back and forth between two girls, Mercy and Illa, who occupy vastly different social strata at the school. Mercy is the star of the high school basketball team, in a town where high school basketball is a very, very big deal. There are times when she seems to carry the weight of the struggling town on her shoulders. But the pressures in her life extend well beyond the court.

But conditions in Ireland are far from ideal for a celebration: Irish nationalists are fed up with English rule, and tensions over land, crops, and livelihood simmer.</p>\n<p>For some, the sunny, blue skies are a metaphor for the British Empire, &quot;upon which it was proclaimed the sun would never set.&quot; For others, the heat and unrelenting sun creates an atmosphere of humid, airless imprisonment, a metaphor for the reign of Queen Victoria suppressing Ireland into poverty and deprivation. Only the precious few with connections to England can rise above the grime, argue the Irish nationalists, and those fighting against her Majesty's rule promise to lift everyone up to the light.</p>\n<p>In the midst of the heat-riddled celebrations, two bodies are found on the outskirts of Dublin. To Detective Sergeant Swallow, the murders appear unconnected to the upcoming visit of Prince Albert. But when Swallow is taken off the case — viciously warned away by Scotland Yard's Special Irish Branch — he begins to suspect deep, dark, and dangerous connections between the murders and the political intrigues simmering away in the unusual June heat. There is nothing ordinary at all in the weather, in the murders, or in the handling of the cases. Swallow should just walk away, for the sake of his career as well as for the safety of his family.

I had recently become a vegetarian, so I was delighted when, after finishing the book, he announced that he was forever forswearing meat. A week later, that vow became a promise to avoid McDonald's whenever possible. A week after that, he was back in line for the drive-through.</p>\n<p><em>Fast Food Nation</em>, Michael Pollan's <em>The Omnivore's Dilemma</em>, Jonathan Safran Foer's <em>Eating Animals</em>: for as long as there have been factory farms, there have been books documenting their evils. None of them has had more than a marginal effect on the meat industry, but there's reason to believe that Barry Estabrook's clearheaded dissection of the pork industry, <em>Pig Tales</em>, will fare better.</p>\n<p>Estabrook walks the reader through the arguments for ending intensive pig farming like a detective building his case; despite its serious subject, the book is a page-turner. He begins by describing the intelligence and social lives of pigs themselves; one chapter is devoted to a &quot;highly sociable piglet&quot; named Christopher who &quot;adored belly rubs.&quot; Then he goes in for the (rhetorical) kill. &quot;Factory-raised meat may be cheap, but those inexpensive chops come at a cost. No facet of modern food production does as much harm to the environment, the animals it raises, and the people it employs as the pork industry.&quot; And the meat, Estabrook says, doesn't even taste good anymore.</p>\n<p>The villains of <em>Pig Tales</em> are the giant corporations that process nearly 70 percent of all the hogs in this country. The heroes are individual producers like Jennifer Small and Michael Yezzi, who run their small farm humanely, with concern for the pigs and the farmworkers alike. It's on operations like theirs that Estabrook pins his hope for the future. The good news for meat eaters, and the reason I think <em>Pig Tales</em> might persuade a good number people to change their diets, is that, according to Estabrook, you don't have to give up bacon, just the mass-produced kind.

She spends three hundred pages trying to explain — to herself as much as to readers — a massive mistake that destroys her personal life and wrecks her career. If nothing else, <em>Criminal That I Am</em> will make you feel better about your own screw-ups.</p>\n<p>Ridha's crime is, by her own acknowledgement, monumentally foolish. While representing Cameron Douglas, son of a certain 1990s movie star (can you say &quot;Gordon Gekko&quot;?) who is charged with dealing meth, she makes a series of idiotic decisions, and in the process, transforms herself from a nice, upstanding woman into a criminal.</p>\n<p>And this is no poor ignorant kid driven to criminality by despair or poverty or simply not knowing any better. A graduate of Columbia Law School, she finds herself in the ironic position of teaching the theory of punishment to her students while actually receiving her own punishment from the criminal justice system.  Filled with self-deprecating humor and tabloid-worthy scandal, Ridha's memoir illustrates how a rational person does something she knows is wrong but still can't help herself from doing.</p>\n<p>But the crime really isn't the point. Becoming a criminal, and being judged for it, involves an incredible level of intimacy. Ridha watches her secrets exposed one by one. &quot;Over time, the exposure will extend to the most intimate parts of human existence, the spaces that one believes, or at least hopes, will never be public knowledge,&quot; she writes.</p>\n<p>Ultimately <em>Criminal That I Am</em> is an examination of the insane things people do under the influence of a charming con artist, and the self-reflection that follows when they are no longer trapped in the thrall of infatuation.

Eight crossed the finish line.</p>\n<p>One hundred years later, Tim Moore, out of shape and well into his forties, decided to recreate the race.  Why?  As out of shape as he may be, he is even more out of sorts with modern cycling, a sport plagued with drug scandals, pumped up with super-humans riding space age machines, and far removed from the way things used to be: a man, a bike, and long road ahead, to be conquered only with a combination of heart, head, and spirit.</p>\n<p>With all the enthusiasm that only the most cock-eyed quests can conjure (think Don Quixote and windmills), Moore vows to be utterly authentic in his re-creation of the race, everything from wooden bike to woolen jersey to stout leather shoes and blue-glassed goggles.  But first, he has to put a bike together and get his body into shape – both of which he accomplishes through hilarious efforts. &quot;Hilarious&quot; covers pretty much everything Moore does to prepare for, and complete, his quest.  I laughed throughout this book, and stopped only when my eyes flooded a bit with emotion, as when his parents join him for one stage of the journey. We imagine that at some point during this comedy of errors – as he tries to recreate this tour to exacting historical accuracy – that he would recognize the utter absurdity of his quest. But his stubborn commitment to finish, despite all the obstacles (most of which he saddled upon himself), makes for an entertainingly gleeful adventure.</p>\n<p><em>Gironimo!</em> is not only a book about cycling, questing, and craziness; it is also one of the best travel books I've read in a long time, offering vivid appraisals of the paradises and purgatories through which Moore cycles. He starts and ends his journey in Milan (his finale there is splendid and unexpected and wonderful), and in between goes from one coast of Italy to the other, and down south to back north. He describes all that he sees, the heartbreaking destruction in earthquake-damaged L'Aquila, the gorgeous squares and facades in  Ascoli, the banal but utterly comfortable and pleasant Pesaro - and so on and on we go, racing (or not, depends on the state of the bike and the weather) through Italy. Up hill and down, through swarms of midges and over pot holes, dodging treacherous traffic and singing when all alone: Moore takes us with him, the toll of kilometers rising higher and higher.</p>\n<p>I loved this book and I am not even a cycling fan! But I am a fan of honest, funny, smart, and informative memoirs, and <em>Gironimo!</em> has it all.  With all that cycling, we get to the meaning of life: the destination is not the point, the journey is.

That is, not until you read Cole Cohen's brave, brilliant, and bitingly funny memoir <em>Head Case: My Brain and Other Wonders</em>.</p>\n<p>At age 26, Cohen cannot judge distance, time or space; is undone by the simplest math equation; and cannot shop in a grocery store without getting lost. Although she has seen dozens of psychologists, speech pathologists, and therapists since childhood, no one has figured out why everyday tasks elude Cohen and why leaving the front door of her house terrifies her. That is, until an intrepid neurologist finally locates a hole in the writer's parietal lobe that she describes as &quot;about the size of a lemon.&quot; Suddenly, her whole existence begins to make sense.</p>\n<p>As she retraces her life from birth to the present, about five years after her diagnosis, we are treated to a vivid voice that is defiantly unsentimental and daringly original. Words, which failed her for much of her life, empower Cohen as an author. Whether describing the angst of her first relationship, attending college and graduate school, or trying valiantly to hold down a job, Cohen conveys her experiences with the acerbic timing of Gore Vidal. About her endlessly patient parents, she writes: &quot;My mother is a librarian and my dad is a philosophy professor; I am their longest-running joint research project.&quot;</p>\n<p>I'll admit I approached this debut work with a tinge of caution. First, I'm a tad squeamish about gray matter. (The 1983 Steve Martin comedy, &quot;The Man With Two Brains,&quot; haunted me for years). And after over-indulging on 90s memoirs about every dysfunction from alcoholism and gambling to food addiction and pyromania, I’ve become a skeptic when a book touts &quot;a never-before-heard story.&quot;  However, I’m glad I took this thoughtful, fearless, inspiring, and, yes, never-before-heard journey with Cohen, a journey I hope you will take as well.</p>\n","img":"HeadCase.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>What’s funny about having a hole in your brain the size of a lemon?

In the same vein as his previous novels <em>The Wanderers</em>, <em>Clockers</em>, <em>Freedomland</em>, his screenplay for <em>The Color of Money</em>, or even his episodes of <em>The Wire</em>, this novel was intended, as Price has said, to be, &quot;slicker, tighter, faster, more on the surface of what’s happening.&quot; Price used the pseudonym because he planned to write this book quickly to make money. But he couldn't do it, and after working on the novel for several years, he realized &quot;it's another damn book by me, there's no separation, there's no genre, there's no nothing, except another book.&quot;</p>\n<p>As if any book by Price could be just another book. <em>The Whites</em> certainly isn't – it is slick, tight, fast, but also superbly written, full of social resonance, one of the finest novels about a policeman and what a policeman's work consists of, in recent memory. And its protagonist is a great and complicated creation. Billy Graves, a sergeant in Manhattan's Night Watch, the cadre of detectives who respond to all &quot;felony-weight&quot; crimes from Washington Heights to Wall Street from one to eight a.m., is haunted by his past mistakes, by the unfaded specter of his apprentice days in a crime-ridden New York in the 1990s, and by the daily burden of managing the demons of the night shift. He works all night, and comes home every morning to a wife, Carmen, and two young children whom he barely sees in passing.</p>\n<p>Billy Graves spends a lot of time alone, managing (or not) the demons in his head, and we are right there with him. It is a claustrophobic and riveting place to be. On the surface, <em>The Whites</em> is a crime novel; it begins, gaudily, on St. Patrick's Day with the murder of a man who figured in the unsolved death of a 12-year-old boy early in Graves' career. But it is also a relentless psychological portrait of a haunted man who sees too much darkness around him to concentrate on the glimmers of light.</p>\n<p>The title is a reference to Melville's Moby-Dick, and to the cases, that become a detectives' &quot;personal Whites&quot; – perps who &quot;committed criminal obscenities... and then walked away untouched by justice,&quot; and crimes that &quot;arbitrarily lay siege to their psyches like bouts of malaria.&quot; <em>The Whites</em> has that effect – it lays siege. It is a novel of a policeman's mind at work, but it also about New York today and in a not-too-distant yesterday, with a cast of colorful characters on both sides of the law (the parenthetical, off-hand detail and sustained portraiture are equally vivid); and there is real, looming danger, as past and present converge.  The separation of public and private, of good and evil, has never felt more dangerously thin, with Price accelerating the tension, and the pace, as that line and the line between justice and revenge, becomes grittier and almost invisible.</p>\n","img":"TheWhites.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>One of the finest novels about a policeman and what a policeman's work consists of, in recent memory.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":5,"visible":true,"judge_id":9,"store_id":1,"in_stock":false,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":2,"authors":[69]},"68":{"id":68,"mmid":1404979,"title":"Local Girls","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":7,"year":0,"pages":288,"description_title":"A Movie Star Walks Into a Bar","description":"<p>Four girls on the cusp of adulthood, each dying to get out of their &quot;burn-out&quot; small-time town, have been close friends for years. One hot summer night, Sam Decker, a gorgeous, tabloid-worthy, A-list film star (think Ryan Gosling) walks into their local bar.  The girls, astounded by his surprise appearance, clamor for his attention, and Sam is more than happy to oblige.  What starts out as a raucous, alcohol-fueled night, however, will change their lives in ways they can’t begin to anticipate. Come morning, none of the girls will ever be the same.</p>\n<p>The complicated and authentic relationships among the girls is the thing that really drives this story home for me. Both before and after the fateful night, Maggie, Lindsey, Lila, and Nina are bound together—and pulled apart—by the secrets they each carry. As with every group of friends, each person has their role to play: the optimist, the prankster, the dreamer, the stoic. But the girls are growing into women and their roles are changing as choices are made, connections are severed, and consequences become real.</p>\n<p>Over their years of friendship, the group dynamic has shifted, and the glamorous Sam Decker is a catalyst that fissures the friendships.  All of the girls will be hurt, and not all of them will heal.  I was haunted by how the fallout from a single night can damage the long-standing love of childhood friends, leave wounds that will be carried for a very long time, and impact their futures in ways I can only imagine. That's the next novel I would love to read, telling the ongoing story of these girls as they become women. (Are you listening, Caroline?

The eldest daughter Christina wanted for nothing: a wild animal trainer entertained at her tenth birthday party; when she turned fourteen, her presents included a $2,000 Tiffany watch and a cameo role on Dawson's Creek. And when love faltered—as it did on the day her dad Tom lost his temper and threw her against a wall—lavish gifts were the remedy. Tom left the house and returned with a fancy Scarlett O'Hara doll in a velvet-ribboned box.</p>\n<p>And then it all came crashing down. In this riveting, thoughtful memoir, Christina traces the fallout (both material and emotional) after her father's business deals with Jordan Belfort (aka the &quot;Wolf of Wall Street&quot;) resulted in a securities fraud conviction in 2000. With Tom in prison, his family lost their home, their belongings, their very selves: if love is possessions, what are you once they're gone? Hardest of all for Christina, then 19, was believing that the father she adored had built her fairytale childhood on lies—and was lying still. Prousalis insisted he was innocent, even as he laundered money in Christina's name, stealing her identity and plunging her into $100,000 worth of debt. To distance herself from it all, Christina ultimately changed her last name to McDowell.</p>\n<p>When the movie <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em> opened in 2013, Christina wrote an <a href=\"http://www.laweekly.com/news/an-open-letter-to-the-makers-of-the-wolf-of-wall-street-and-the-wolf-himself-4255219\" target=\"_blank\">open letter</a> to Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio in which she castigated them for glorifying Belfort's (and her father's) crimes. The letter quickly went viral. (Her father then wrote a vitriolic open letter in which he castigated her for the letter she'd written.)</p>\n<p>There's a rubbernecking-at-the-car-crash aspect to reading about Christina's fall: her spiral into drugs and alcohol, her desperate promiscuity, her abandonment of acting dreams for sleazy bar jobs that paid the rent. She isn't always easy to like—you just know she was that snooty Mean Girl in high school—but she wins you over with her smarts and the sincerity of her struggle to understand her past and move beyond its soul-deadening materialism.</p>\n<p>&quot;Remember, Bambina.

Or rather, I stopped being a bourbon drinker as soon as I got old enough that an evening's glass would guarantee a headache the next day. But even though I no longer drink the spirits Reid Mitenbuler describes in <em>Bourbon Empire</em>, I had a lot of fun reading about their history. Or histories.</p>\n<p>For example: there's a fancy kind of bourbon called Michter's that prints &quot;EST. 1753&quot; on its label. Really, though, Michter's didn't exist until the 1950s, when a liquor executive made it up by combining the names of his two sons, Michael and Peter. The Michter's distillery was on a piece of land that, in 1753, belonged to a farmer named Johann Shenk, who also sometimes made whiskey. The Michter's that you buy today, though, isn't even produced on Shenk's land—another company bought the trademark in the 1990s and now distills its whiskey in a brand-new facility hundreds of miles away. So much for heritage.</p>\n<p>Mitenbuler, for the most part, doesn't care that brands like Michter's are fakes. He knows the history of bourbon, and it was ever always thus. &quot;Even in the nineteenth century,&quot; he writes, &quot;at the dawn of modern liquor marketing, brands began creating fake backstories.&quot; The more important question for Mitenbuler—and for anyone willing to risk that headache the next morning—is whether the bourbon is any good.</p>\n<p>But first, some definitions. Bourbon is whiskey, yes, but it's whiskey that has passed three tests: 1. it's distilled in the United States (any state, not just Kentucky); 2. the grains used to make it must be at least 51 percent corn (usually a good deal more than that, most often accompanied by rye and barley); and 3. it must be aged in charred oak barrels (new white oak, to be specific). The char in the barrel caramelizes the sugars in the wood, creating sweet flavors that end up in the booze.</p>\n<p>There's a lot more to absorb, including all sorts of jargon like white dog, feints, sweet mash, sour mash, and honey barrels, to name a few. The same goes for the author's view of American history as seen through a bourbon glass. We learn that George Washington had a distillery at Mount Vernon; that the word &quot;julep&quot; (as in a mint julep) derives from the Arabic <em>julab</em>, which means rosewater; and that Peoria, Illinois, was once the great bourbon capital of the country.</p>\n<p>You might scoff at the idea of drinking Peoria's finest, but Mitenbuler doesn't. Just as he seems to delight in debunking the backstories of Johnny-come-lately whiskey makers, he happily celebrates the industrial spirits-makers who turn out consistently good products but get no credit because they aren’t considered &quot;artisanal.&quot; Of Midwest Grain Products Ingredients (MGPI), a giant distillery in Indiana that makes whiskies for such brands as Bulleit, Templeton, High West, and Redemption, he says, &quot;MGPI is often mocked, but it is actually one of the oldest distilleries in the country, giving it the kind of real heritage that many brands covet.&quot;</p>\n<p>The ultimate message is one I'll take to heart if I ever do decide to try another bourbon on the rocks: drink what you want, no matter what the label looks like.</p>\n","img":"BourbonEmpire.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>The ultimate message is … drink what you want, no matter what the label looks like.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":4,"visible":true,"judge_id":6,"store_id":1,"in_stock":false,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":21,"authors":[73]},"72":{"id":72,"mmid":1404988,"title":"Freedom's Child","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":7,"year":0,"pages":320,"description_title":"A Mom.

And his book <em>The Accidental Billionaires</em>, about the history of Facebook, was adapted into the movie <em>The Social Network</em>.</p>\n<p>This book is compelling because the story is bonkers! It has all the twists and turns of a Tom Clancy novel. The rapid paced storytelling, the mixed loyalties and back-stabbings make <em>Once Upon a Time in Russia</em> read like an Elmore Leonard book on steroids. It is amazing to think that events like these happen outside of fiction. But, in Mezrich's hands, these make the best stories of all.</p>\n","img":"OnceUponATimeInRussia.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>One day, you're shaking hands with an associate across the table; the next day, his men have you surrounded in your armored car.

At the time, I don't think most girls dreamed of having lives of adventure — cowboys, astronauts, river boat captains — those were not female fantasies. But using intelligence and curiosity to solve mysteries, hiding inside dumbwaiters and recording stealth observations in a journal, piling into a convertible with pals to go and investigate a spate of burglaries — now THAT was interesting.</p>\n<p>Cut to 2015, and it seems I did put that career goal of becoming a double agent on hold. But I still get a vicarious thrill from reading spy fiction, especially when the star is a woman. Enter Captain Dominika Egorova of the Russian Intelligence Service, who's now secretly working for the other side (i.e., our side). She's the heroine of Jason Matthews' <em>Palace of Treason</em>, a book I inhaled in an afternoon. It's the closest thing written recently to the best work of John LeCarre. And for good reason — the author is a retired CIA guy. I guess they didn't make him sign one of those &quot;do not disclose&quot; forms.</p>\n<p>I don't go in for most &quot;genre&quot; books, but I am always on the hunt for a suspenseful, well-written mystery/thriller, especially when geopolitics is involved.

But now the parents have returned to their native village, and Letty's sure she can't make it without them.

You'll read it quickly, but upon finishing, you'll wish that you'd read it more slowly, if only to live a little longer in the world of Mazie Phillips, the proprietor of New York's Venice movie theater, where &quot;everyone's welcome… even the snobs.&quot; Mazie, a real person made famous by Joseph Mitchell's 1940 profile in <em>The New Yorker</em>, presided over the Lower East Side movie house — she was colorful, generous, and as much a fixture in her neighborhood as the theater she ran.</p>\n<p>Coming of age in the Roaring Twenties, Mazie's adventures as a single woman in underground New York — her dance hall escapades and Prohibition-defying love of speakeasies — make her the kind of character that stands out among so many Jazz Age personalities.</p>\n<p>Opening the theater to down-on-their luck men from the neighborhood as the Depression takes hold, she becomes the matriarch of a different kind of family, one whose disparate members Attenberg depicts with nuanced eccentricity. &quot;I couldn't ignore them,&quot; Mazie says to Joseph Mitchell when he proposes writing her story. &quot;I'm not so interesting. It's the bums that have the real story.&quot; He tells her, &quot;No, the bums are interesting because of you.&quot;</p>\n<p>Though based on a real woman, <em>Saint Mazie</em> is an imagined history compiled almost entirely through fictional documents. The book switches between entries from her &quot;unpublished autobiography&quot; and entries from her diary spanning from 1907–1939, which has been &quot;discovered&quot; decades later. That these made-up sources feel authentic and cohesive is a testament of the author's superior talent.</p>\n<p>Through this unusual structure, Attenberg deploys a chorus of voices that together create an oral history of those who knew Mazie best, each of whom helps to bring her to life. The Red Hook man who finds Mazie's diary in a box near the Brooklyn Navy Yard is in awe of the Mazie he meets there: &quot;I just heard her in my head so clearly and thought I <em>know</em> her… And I knew the quality of her character, which made me think I could spend the rest of my life with her.&quot; This is just how I felt reading <em>Saint Mazie</em>.

You could tell that this new work of hers was a labor of love.  It was magical.</p>\n<p>Early readers are describing this novel as being about the long course of a marriage, and it is that, but what really resonated with me is its depiction of adolescence, of passion, of selfishness, of narcissism, of beauty, whether careless or studied.  It made me nostalgic for youth, and a little melancholy about what happens when that glow starts to fade. And in a funny way, the book made me yearn for those years in my early life when I could afford to be a little reckless.</p>\n<p>Lotto and Mathilde are the husband and wife at the story's center.  Lotto is charmed and charming; Mathilde is a beautiful enigma. They are glamorous in the way Bogie and Bacall were, or F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald—individually they are alluring, but together their appeal is dazzling.  But, as is often true with real people, their exteriors mask what's really going on in their heads—the insecurities, the loneliness, the fear of abandonment.  Their love props them up and bolsters them throughout their lives, yes, but what Groff conveys so exquisitely is that even larger-than-life creatures like these, who seem to have it all, wind up alone with their spinning thoughts at the end of each day, just like the rest of us.</p>\n<p>As many references as this novel contains to Shakespeare, to Greek mythology, to playwrights obscure and well-known, it is not a cerebral book.  It's a book that leads with its heart, and with a playful and exuberant language that is wholly the author's own. And there's also a little hint of Gone Girl in this book—secrets that the spouses keep from one another, and—spoiler alert—the narrator isn't always reliable.</p>\n<p>If you are in the mood for something delicious, transporting, and a little self-indulgent, treat yourself to this exquisite novel.</p>\n","img":"fatesAndFuries.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>The book made me yearn for those years in my early life when I could afford to be a little reckless.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":1,"visible":true,"judge_id":12,"store_id":1,"in_stock":true,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":23,"authors":[80]},"79":{"id":79,"mmid":1405062,"title":"Gold Fame Citrus","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":9,"year":0,"pages":352,"description_title":"California's Dystopian Future: Can You Survive the Dune?","description":"<p>There's plenty to distinguish the dystopian California depicted in <em>Gold Fame Citrus</em> from the real one: the state has been evacuated by the government, its borders have been sealed, and most of its landmass has been gobbled up by a giant white sand dune. It's a sign of Watkins's enviable powers as a writer that this strange world feels less like a fantasy than a premonition'the future she's created feels urgently important and deeply plausible.</p>\n<p>She's gotten an assist, it's true, from the ongoing drought in the West. (For real-life Californians, Watkin's apocalypse might be just a bit too plausible.) The drought in <em>Gold Fame Citrus</em> has lasted for more than twenty years, long enough for most of the state's residents to flee eastward; the ones who stayed behind scrap with each other for scraps: &quot;ration cola,&quot; derelict houses, and contraband fruit smuggled from wetter, happier places. They cluster along the coast, too cussed to do much but survive.</p>\n<p>That's how we find Luz and Ray, two young survivors squatting in a movie star's abandoned mansion in the charred hills above Los Angeles. After they rescue a malnourished child from a group of drifters, they are forced to leave their home and head into the desert, where they find a community that has all the hallmarks of a cult: a charismatic leader, a mass of credulous followers, a suspicious number of attractive young female disciples. Will they join the cult or, by fighting it, risk death in the dunes?</p>\n<p>Watkins is a great writer of sentences, with an allergy to cliché and a well-tuned sense of how to balance the beautiful and the hard-edged in her prose. My guess is that her work is another proof of Maya Angelou's dictum that &quot;easy reading is damn hard writing.&quot; The effort, thank goodness, pays off page after page.</p>\n<p>I would say that Watkins borrows from a rich tradition of post-apocalyptic stories that play out in the desert: Cormac McCarthy's <em>The Road</em>, Stephen King's <em>The Stand</em>, the Mad Max movies. It's certainly as memorable as any of those works. But here's where I should probably mention that Watkins's father was a member of the Manson Family, and she grew up in Death Valley. Did she use some of her family history to create the world of this novel—I certainly hope so.

Brown uses both quantitative and qualitative research, with a big emphasis on her personal experiences, to create a narrative about when, how and why to apply this process to your own life.</p>\n<p>For me, the number one takeaway from this book is the advice to write down whose opinion matters in your life on a small piece of paper.

The gruesomely mutilated body of a young boy is uncovered in the dump on the outskirts of town.

Batacan has constructed two charming, compassionate characters who I won't soon forget.

Their gentle handling of the case brings a genuinely human aspect to the story.</p>\n<p>Not to mention, their impressive skills of detection are great fun to follow! Their calm, cool nature (plus a lot of hard work) ultimately allows the truth to rise to the surface. This is a wonderful book, incredibly charming, despite the dark crimes.

Perfect as a post-Halloween recovery, Schiff's rich social history is a compulsively gripping and deliciously fun page-turner, filled with gossip, deceit, suspicion, and lots of creepiness.</p>\n<p>Like me, you will have to throw out much of what you thought you knew about the notorious witch trials. According to Schiff there is more misinformation about this American tragedy than actual facts. So, you will marvel, as I did, at how exhaustively and painstakingly Schiff recreates 17th century Salem—its fear and dread, hysteria and isolation, misogyny and madness.  <em>The Witches</em> is also one of the most seamlessly colorful and atmospheric books I've read in some time.  Against a backdrop of devastating winter, villagers revel in rumors and accusations are tossed like rutabaga stems, as ministers plot to keep a firm grip on their flock.</p>\n<p>As the best-selling biographer of Cleopatra and Vera Nabokov, Schiff has a particular ability to bring to life historical figures in a rich environment.  Salem is a playground of complex and fascinating people, with more characters than one could find in a Tarantino film.  She reaps gold in particular with church minister George Burroughs, a villain out of the Simon Legree School of Baddies. Schiff's premise is that the nine-month trial wasn't about witchcraft or sorcery but rather an effort by Burroughs to instill fear and control throughout villages, particularly over young women.</p>\n<p>Although you may think you know how this story ends, Schiff delivers a doozy of a conclusion that will keep you flipping pages long past bedtime.</p>\n","img":"TheWitches.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>A compulsively gripping and deliciously fun page-turner, filled with gossip, deceit, suspicion, and lots of creepiness.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":5,"visible":true,"judge_id":10,"store_id":1,"in_stock":false,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":19,"authors":[86]},"85":{"id":85,"mmid":1406719,"title":"Barbara the Slut and Other People","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":10,"year":0,"pages":272,"description_title":"Peek Under the Sheets: Stories That Will Make You LOL IRL","description":"<p>When I first heard about this short story collection, I remember giggling nervously. Why had the author decided to title the book so provocatively? Did it need a shtick to help it stand out, or is the book actually as salacious as it sounds?</p>\n<p>There are short fiction writers who tackle the whole breadth of human experience—love, morality, parenthood, heartbreak, angst, mortality, prejudice—and while this collection has its share of existential ennui, it sees everything through the lens of the young, the sexually alive, the humorous.  It is irreverent in a way that turns a gray day bright, because it reminds us that even in the most humdrum or painful situations, humor can save the day. Still, it doesn't skimp on acute observation or on the poignancy of the human condition.</p>\n<p>What Holmes gets at in all the stories is the struggle to come to terms with say, a parent's selfishness, a boyfriend's tendency to behave like a jerk, a friend's propensity to disappoint.  What's especially fresh is Holmes' ability to take the vernacular of youth and pop culture and use it to underscore what a slog life can be, and then make the reader laugh at the absurdity of it all, which is why somehow we come away feeling hopeful and alive.</p>\n<p>I don't really understand people who say they don't like short stories.  To me, stories—when they're good—are perfect little creations, managing to capture something essential about people in all their glorious quirkiness.  Within a few pages of Lauren Holmes' debut work, I realized not only that I was entering the realm of an extraordinary new talent, but that she was making me laugh out loud.</p>\n<p>So put your feet up, pour a glass of wine, and savor this first series of escapades by Lauren Holmes.

But when you're online, you're a total dick. I know when you're typing away on social media or adding to the comments section you feel like a righteous person, defending the environment, or animal rights or veterans. But, actually—total dick.</p>\n<p>Which is why you need to read Jon Ronson's <em>So You've Been Publicly Shamed</em>. Normally, I prefer reading about how other people are bad. A good Pol Pot biography, maybe, or some morally compromised Jonathan Franzen characters. But Jon Ronson's <em>So You've Been Publicly Shamed</em> is about how <em>I'm</em> bad, which, it turns out, is much more interesting, since it's about me.</p>\n<p>It taught me—and hopefully will teach you—how to stop being a jerk by continuing a tradition of jerkishness Ronson traces back to the Colonial-era jerks who put people in stockades, like jerks. Ronson provides a correction to the virtual mob rule that is ruining many non-virtual lives today. For instance, I have no doubt that anyone who reads this book would hold off from going online to rip apart that Minnesota dentist who killed Cecil the Lion. I, for instance, am restraining from doing so right here.</p>\n<p>Ronson visits with lots of people whose lives were ruined when they became social media's Villain Of The Week, including Justine Sacco, the publicist I've felt a lingering guilt about ever since I was too afraid to write a column defending the harmless AIDS joke she tweeted that ended her career and, I learned, her dating life.</p>\n<p>He's somehow able to make us feel awful while still entertaining us. Ronson is a funny, self-effacing, neurotically self-aware, overly trustworthy narrator who spends just slightly more time investigating the emotional wreckage of his subjects than he does investigating the emotional wreckage he experiences thinking about his subjects. He begins the book with stories where he shamed others with liberal righteousness, and follows them with his own fury at being the victim of a social media attack. The two great things we learn about in this book are: what it's like to live in an age of online mob rule; and, what it's like to be Jon Ronson. And they're nearly equally interesting.</p>\n<p>As a person who has written cruel things about people in my columns and had cruel things written about me online, the latter of which I remember far better, I was furious at myself for not writing this book before Ronson did. But I also know he did a far better job than I would have. And, as much as my jealousy is fueling me to do so, I'm not going to write about how much more pleasurable it is to read this in print than to listen to his nasally voice on audiobook.

Natasha Pulley delivers it all in her stunning debut novel. Magical mechanical inventions—like an octopus who steals socks, tiny golden birds that spray the sky with fireworks, and vines that turn dead trees into living things—help to weave magic and fantasy through a story that's set in a real place at a real time.</p>\n<p>Thaniel Steepleton is working at the Home Office of the British Government, lamenting his lost dreams of being a concert pianist. He had to give it all up when his sister's husband died, making him the sole breadwinner for her and her two children. Thaniel works long hours, lives in a colorless flat, has few friends, and not much to brighten his daily life.</p>\n<p>One day he comes home to find a mysterious and beautiful gold watch in his room. Has his sister left it for him as a birthday gift? Or is there something more sinister about this magical gift that seems to have appeared from nowhere? As his uneasiness over its origins increase, he sets off to discover the truth behind the enigmatic watch and find its creator.  His investigations take him from Victorian London to the crumbling cities of post-civil war Japan, where the mysteries of his watch seem only to deepen.</p>\n<p>Pulley takes elements of speculative fantasy and historical fiction with a generous helping of Sherlockian detective work and combines them all together in a story that is stunningly graceful, deeply moving, and absolutely entertaining.  In the end, <em>The Watchmaker of Filigree Street</em> is about the power of love, the twists of fate, the inequities of destiny, and the necessity of being true to one's self. I loved this novel of adventure and intrigue and, for me, the extra lashings of mystery and fantasy sent it flying into the stratosphere of a great read.</p>\n","img":"WatchmakerOfFiligreeStreet.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>Combines speculative fantasy and historical fiction with a generous helping of Sherlockian detective work.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":4,"visible":true,"judge_id":2,"store_id":1,"in_stock":false,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":4,"authors":[89]},"88":{"id":88,"mmid":1407233,"title":"The Magician's Lie","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":11,"year":0,"pages":320,"description_title":"A Magician Accused of Murder, A Cop Who Searches for the Truth","description":"<div class=\"iframeContainer\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/djc37tX9qAE?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0\"></iframe></div>\n","img":"MagiciansLie.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>There's all kinds of stuff going on in this book.

The book is a collection of letters to the men who shaped her life, and while each of the letters are ostensibly about a man, together they reveal more about the author than they do the subjects.  And Parker, the Emmy-, Tony- and Golden Globe-winning actress most famous for her roles in <em>Weeds</em>, <em>The West Wing</em>, and <em>Fried Green Tomatoes</em>, has a lot to reveal about relationships, family, romance and heartbreak.</p>\n<p>The letter recipients in <em>Dear Mr. You</em> include some men she has never known (like her grandfather who died before she was born), men she has only met once (like a cabdriver who witnessed Parker break down completely when she pregnant and single), and of course men who are central to her life (like her father whom she worships as a deity and her son whom she adores like a messiah). One beautiful letter is a description of a casual but profoundly meaningful encounter at a party with a charming man with whom she feels a deep connection and whom she finds out is dying of cancer.</p>\n<p>She describes, in loving detail, more than three decades of sexual and emotional experiences. These encounters are in some cases hilarious and in others heartbreaking.</p>\n<p>Not all the men are good. Various monsters make appearances, under pseudonyms. One man, called &quot;Cerberus,&quot; is a violent misogynist with a massive appetite for infidelity. Parker's eye for crisp detail is fully on display in this chapter; she comes out with a truly damning indictment: he cheated at laser tag. She is so, so right. A man who would cheat at laser tag is capable of anything.</p>\n<p>Whether or not you're a fan of Parker's, you'll be enthralled by the honesty with which she reveals herself, even—or especially—at her worst moments.

In this case, she brings to life the Marquis de Lafayette, a Revolutionary War hero that Lin-Manual Miranda called &quot;America's favorite fighting Frenchman&quot; in his hit Broadway show <em>Hamilton</em>.  In fact, it's likely that that United States would not exist today without both of these men, and Vowell's unconventional biography will entertain you with the inside story behind this unlikely American hero.</p>\n<p>According to Vowell, America's long-standing love for Lafayette is one of the only things our country has ever been able to collectively agree on. For instance, when Lafayette returned to the States to mark the 50th anniversary of the American Revolution, he attended a party held in his honor every night for over a year. That's a lot of partying.  Even for a Frenchman.</p>\n<p>By the age of nineteen, Lafayette had already married and started a family. But he longed for the type of glory that the men in his family had historically earned in battle. (Notably, they had all died in battle, too.) Lacking a war to fight in France, Lafayette offered his services to George Washington in America. At the time, Washington was busy losing skirmishes to the British, and thanks to Lafayette's social standing and money, was more than happy to let him help. It was Lafayette who convinced the king of France to support the Americans in the war, helping to turn the tide, and endearing Lafayette in the hearts of Americans forever.</p>\n<p>Fans of Bill Bryson, David Sedaris, and Samantha Bee are sure to enjoy this peculiar take on a lesser-known figure in the American Revolution.

I wasn't expecting this debut to meet my standards, but boy does <em>What She Knew</em> deliver.</p>\n<p>The event that sets the story in motion is enough to still any parent's heart: on a walk in the woods near Bristol with his divorced mom, Rachel, 8-year-old Ben Finch begs to run ahead to their favorite rope swing.  Rachel nervously agrees because &quot;in the absence of Ben's dad I thought it was my responsibility to…encourage Ben to be independent, to take risks, to discover life.&quot; The empty, still-swaying swing she sees when she arrives tells her she made the wrong call.</p>\n<p>In the nightmare days that follow, DI James Clemo (sexy, damaged) battles the clock to find Ben. As the odds that Ben has survived diminish, Rachel finds herself questioning not just her own judgment, but everything and everyone. Is her &quot;mother-of-the-year&quot; sister Nicky uncomplicatedly devoted—or hiding devastating secrets? Could her best friend Laura be feeding information to the ravenous press? Is maternal instinct her best friend, or will it invariably lead her astray? Detective Clemo seems devastated by the case on a deeply personal level. But why?</p>\n<p>As Rachel's version of events alternates with Detective Clemo's, Gilly Macmillan keeps the tension building—this is an up-til-3-am kind of read—without stinting on substance or character development.

Set in war-torn and superstition-ridden 13th century Bohemia (modern-day Czech Republic), I was hooked from the very first page, as Mouse flexes her powers to save the life of a young man (who turns out to be heir apparent to the throne of Bohemia).</p>\n<p>I never expected <em>Bohemian Gospel</em> to knock me off my feet but it did. <em>Bohemian Gospel</em> is one part historical thriller, in which Mouse becomes both pawn and broker in the fight for power between the Pope in Rome and the warring factions in Bohemia; one part adventure fantasy, in which Mouse battles evil literally in the form of creepy half-dead creatures and figuratively in the anger stirring in her own soul; and all parts girl power, in which Mouse sets out on a quest of self-discovery that will test her every strength and all her reserves – and leave us gasping in her wake.</p>\n<p>What makes Mouse such a marvelous heroine is that she defies all stereotypes of female superhero: she ages (and then turns back to middle-aged again); she becomes ugly (at one point she is a Golem-like character relegated to the edge of humanity); she suffers through gut-wrenching episodes of self-doubt and hopelessness; and sometimes she is just not very nice.  Instead of relying on typical female strengths of beauty and kindness, Mouse's power derives from her ability to think and to reason and to fight.  When she cares about someone or something, she cares all the way and will go to the ends of the earth to protect what she loves from harm.

What hit me the hardest in 2015 was Jill Leovy's <em>Ghettoside</em>. It's just the sort of thing I go for: an exhaustively researched non-fiction account of people I know nothing about. When those people are from India, as in Katherine Boo's <em>Beyond The Beautiful Forevers</em> one can sort of be forgiven, but in <em>Ghettoside</em>, as in Adrian Nicole LeBlanc's masterful <em>Random Family</em>, the strangers are Americans. They live in our towns, but in another part. The part we avoid, most likely.</p>\n<p>This book focuses on the 77th Division of South Central Los Angeles, and follows a number of homicide detectives tasked with solving gang-related murders, the kind buried deep inside the newspaper, or perhaps not mentioned at all. In preparing this recommendation, I read a number of reviews. All of them were positive, and praised the author's reportorial skills. They put the book in context, mentioning the murders of Michael Brown and the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement. They made it sound important, which it is, and wise. What they left out, and what I so enjoyed about <em>Ghettoside</em>, is that it reads like a novel. It’s meticulously paced and the writing frequently stopped me cold.</p>\n<p>What I most loved was how it challenged my expectations. Why had I thought that the detectives—most of them white—wouldn’t care that some gang member was murdered, or that the families of the victims, people to whom gun violence is an everyday event, would accept the deaths of their teenagers without anger or grief, as simply par for the course? Like all great books, this one leaves you thinking, not just &quot;Who are they,&quot; but also &quot;Who am I?&quot;</p>\n<p>Many of the reviews I read recommended the book as medicine, a disservice, I thought, as it's so enthralling. I feel bad using that word when these are real people, and they're suffering so horribly. It's to the author's credit that <em>Ghettoside</em> is so hard to put down, and that you wind up caring for everyone involved. When killers are caught, you don't feel victorious so much as sad. Another life wasted. Unlike a detective novel where you think, &quot;Well, that happened,&quot; here there's the sense of the grinding wheel, one gang-related murder after another. On and on and on. It's relentless and brutal, and Jill Leovy's account of it is art.</p>\n","img":"GhettoSide.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>Ghettoside</em> reads like a novel.

Her mother was her father's fifth wife, and she had countless siblings, both full and halfs. After her father is murdered by his brother in a battle for control of the colony, Ruth's mother marries Lane, a man who already has multiple wives and more children than he can come close to supporting.</p>\n<p>The conditions that Ruthie and her siblings endure because of Lane's neglect and disdain for children that &quot;aren't his&quot; are barely livable, with holes in the roof, exposed wires, rarely functioning plumbing and animals making themselves at home in the walls. Completely at the mercy of her stepfather, Ruthie's family has few resources beyond the food stamps that they're illegally collecting. Until Lane goes one step too far and Ruthie's mother decides she's had enough.</p>\n<p>Told in sparse language and matter-of-fact prose, Ruth Wariner's memoir is the kind of story that hits you across the face without you even being aware you've been punched until it’s over. The author's memories of this time – the nine years that make up the book, from ages 6 to 15 – are conveyed almost without emotion, except for the undeniable affection she feels for her siblings. You'll believe there isn't possibly any more that this ever-expanding family (yes, there are more and more siblings) can go through, until there is more and they have to go to battle once again.</p>\n<p>While the initial appeal of this memoir might be the can't-look-away, is-this-even-real rubbernecker allure, what keeps the pages turning are these kids, some damaged, all vulnerable, and the hope that against all odds they get out alive.

He's assigned to investigate a case in which a woman has been found murdered in the hotel room of a billionaire hedge fund owner. The suspect? Vernon James.</p>\n<p>At first, Terry is almost delighted. He spent many years pulling his life back together while Vernon made his millions. He'd love to see Vernon's life in shambles, and the case seems open-and-shut. But when Terry uncovers evidence that things might not be what they appear, he must decide which he wants more: revenge or justice.</p>\n<p><em>The Verdict</em> is brilliantly plotted, with incredible twists and turns that kept me guessing until the very end. It's a great mystery, a refreshing storyline and a spectacular legal thriller. There's double-crossing, blackmail, hidden agendas, conspiracies and danger around every corner. Terry doesn't know who he can trust, and following along as he searches for answers and wrestles with his conscience is electrifying.</p>\n<p>And the conclusion! Spoiler: it's fantastic. Nick Stone has delivered one of the most satisfying thrillers of the decade.</p>\n","img":"TheVerdict.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>A spectacular legal thriller.

Who can walk away from an ex-army medic named after a '60s dream car, and who not only rides a Harley but drives a pick-up and handles her fifty-nine foot Custom Carolina with ease?  Yes, Camaro might be on the lam for killing five men, but I had the feeling from the get-go that they might have deserved it.  Now all she wants to do is lie low and let life flow around her, leaving her past in the past and worrying as little as possible about the future.

There is a supporting cast so engaging you're drawn deeply into the drama: Cuban exiles in Miami charting a course for revenge, low-life punks getting in the mix, and one hapless sucker who falls into the mess, endangering his innocent daughter.  And then, of course, there is the rumpled yet dogged police detective on the case.</p>\n<p>No damsels in distress for me, no weak-kneed, lily-livered sweethearts: I like my literary women to be strong-willed, courageous, smart, and rebellious.  And Camaro doesn't disappoint. Tight-lipped and strong-muscled, and of course with a heart of gold, she has a mind as sharp as her left uppercut, but can she slice through all the crap and get the job done?</p>\n<p>I was hanging on by my fingernails for an answer to that question, following her every move with my heart in my throat.  Camaro is a fascinating and compelling woman, who you can't help but root for. The ending was fabulous, a fantastic climatic showdown – and, happily for all of us, the set-up for more Camaro adventures to come.

It's the perfect namesake for Ed Tarkington's story about all kinds of love, and learning that the things you think you understand when you are a child, may not have been what they seemed at the time.</p>\n<p>1977: The narrator, an eight-year-old boy named Rocky, lives in a small Virginia town and and worships his teenage half brother, Paul.  When Paul does something unforgivable and disappears, his abrupt departure wreaks havoc on the family.</p>\n<p>1984: Rocky, now fifteen years old, is enjoying the perfect summer.  But faces – and stories – from the past are about to change all that. And Rocky will learn that first love and familial love are more complicated than he had imagined.</p>\n<p>Tarkington does a great job capturing Rocky in both stages of his life: as a naive boy reacting to the grown-up drama around him, and then as a teenager, with dreams and hopes and rampaging hormones. Like a Southern John Irving novel this book is both sweet and heartbreaking, most often when Rocky is getting himself into adult situations, like a fling with the neighbor's much-older daughter.</p>\n<p>Like <em>The Wonder Years</em> or <em>A Christmas Story</em>, Tarkington's ability to shine a retrospective light on the painful awkwardness of childhood is masterful, and the story is entertaining and well-plotted, even when it takes a turn toward the more serious. Rocky might not always make the best decisions, but we're rooting for him regardless. Because that's what growing up is all about.</p>\n","img":"OnlyLoveCanBreakYourHeart.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>Like <em>The Wonder Years</em> or <em>A Christmas Story</em>, Tarkington's ability to shine a retrospective light on the painful awkwardness of childhood is masterful and entertaining.</p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":3,"visible":true,"judge_id":4,"store_id":1,"in_stock":true,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":13,"authors":[101]},"101":{"id":101,"mmid":1402721,"title":"The Oregon Trail","subtitle":"A New American Journey","pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":1,"year":1,"pages":464,"description_title":"Two Mules and a Wagon &ndash; And A Dog Named Olive Oyl","description":"<p>Rinker Buck has done what I have long dreamed of doing: he's gone off on a totally ridiculous journey just for the hell of it. The good news is that he left a book behind so the rest of us can follow him.</p>\n<p>Buck's journey is more ridiculous than most, crossing the two thousand miles of the Oregon Trail from Missouri to the Pacific Coast, a route that was once traversed by 400,000 pioneers in search of free land. Of course many of them driven to this journey by economic need and legal troubles, as Buck writes: &quot;Frequently, to be an American then was to be periodically unmoored, transient, so bereft of options that moving on was the only choice.&quot;</p>\n<p>That's exactly what the journey is for Buck too. He begins his journey divorced, nearly bankrupt, and drunk. Is he running away from something or running to something else? I love that that question is never fully answered. He travels the old-fashioned way, by mule and caravan, with a Jack Russell Terrier named Olive Oyl and his brother Nick. This cantankerous company makes the journey not only more historically accurate but more entertaining too.</p>\n<p>As the motley crew trundles down the road, Buck offers wonderful little pocket histories of the period and the region. These are my favorite parts. The book is worth reading if only for the loving descriptions of mules. Mules don't have a lot of history to their credit, and they deserve more. Buck gets downright ornery when it comes to preconceived notions about mules. &quot;It is a lot more prestigious for professional academics to sound learned about Senator Thomas Hart Benton or the Missouri Compromise than to actually know something about America’s basic means of transportation for a century,&quot; Buck writes.</p>\n<p>These little histories, told in Buck's unpretentious and comic narration, add up to a portrait of a country, and a people, in deep transition. And that transition is as much about the present as the past. At its core are people exactly like Buck—rollicking men who head west for reasons they can't explain even to themselves.

His goal was to claim what is now the Gulf Coast of the United States for the Spanish crown and, in the process, become as wealthy and famous as Hernán Cortés.</p>\n<p>But from the moment the Narváez expedition landed in Florida, it faced peril—navigational errors, disease, starvation, as well as resistance from indigenous tribes. Within a year there were only four survivors: the expedition's treasurer, Cabeza de Vaca; a Spanish nobleman named Alonso del Castillo; a young explorer named Andrés Dorantes; and Dorantes's Moroccan slave, Mustafa al-Zamori, whom the other three Spaniards called Estebanico. These four survivors would go on to make a journey across America that would transform them from proud conquistadores to humble servants, from fearful outcasts to faith healers.</p>\n<p><em>The Moor's Account</em> brilliantly captures Estebanico's voice and vision, giving us an alternate narrative for this famed expedition. As this dramatic chronicle unfolds, we come to understand that, contrary to popular belief, black men played a significant part in New World exploration, and that Native American men and women were not merely silent witnesses to it. In Laila Lalami's deft hands, Estebanico's memoir illuminates the ways in which stories can transmigrate into history, even as storytelling can offer a chance at redemption and survival.</p>\n","img":"MoorsAccount.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>Selling yourself into slavery to provide for your family: jerk move or noble sacrifice?

Backlash against perceived corruptions of the system and the narrowing of the powerbase into fewer and fewer hands has fueled support for insurgent Presidential campaigns of both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. That's why Sally Denton's <em>The Profiteers</em> is required reading—it’s a history of one set of those very rich, very powerful hands, the hands belonging to the Bechtel family—and it will completely transform how you look at wealth and influence in this country.</p>\n<p>Privately held, the Bechtel company is intensely secretive, necessarily so, since it works in the often shadowy intersection of government, diplomacy and construction. The Bechtels build stuff. They built the Hoover Dam; they built the Big Dig in Boston. They have built even more impressive projects all over the world that you've never heard of. The Bechtels have so much political pull, they create projects where none exist: &quot;If we don't have a client, we find one. If there's no project, we assemble one. If there's no money, we get some.&quot;</p>\n<p>Often these projects find themselves mired in controversy. The Hoover dam's working conditions were a scandal after many laborers died. The Bechtels seem to have no qualms about working with controversial governments such as Saddam Hussein's Iraq.  After Mitt Romney took office in Massachusetts, he was planning on replacing the Bechtel company in the Big Dig. &quot;Following a closed-door meeting with Riley [Bechtel], who flew in on his private jet for a conference with the governor, Romney changed his mind,&quot; Denton notes, then archly adds: &quot;A decade later, the Bechtels would be major donors to Romney's presidential campaign.&quot; Don't you love it when things work out?</p>\n<p>It was Romney, of course, who said that corporations are people too. That's true in two senses for the Bechtels: they are a massive corporation that helps to rule the world, and they are also just a family. But look around – you’re living in the world they built, a world running on the mechanics of money and politics. <em>The Profiteers</em> reveals the workings of the machine – both the company and the family – nimbly. You'll wonder how you'd never heard of them before, but be so grateful that Denton has given you a fascinating peek inside this shadowy and powerful world.</p>\n","img":"TheProfiteers.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>You're living in the world they built, a world running on the mechanics of money and politics.

It's difficult not to feel that secret voyeuristic pull we all have within the pages of this book; this is a big part of what makes it so damn enjoyable.</p>\n<p>But even in his most macabre moments, Hazzard never forgets that he is often seeing people on the worst day of their lives. &quot;EMS is the greatest show I've ever seen, except it's not a show, it's all real,&quot; writes Hazzard.  And that underlying humanity is the true appeal of his stories.

As it was about to land in New Jersey, the Hindenburg, &quot;the world's largest lighter-than-air craft&quot; burst into flames, plunging to the earth and killing thirty-six people.  Was the disaster a result of sabotage, and if so, for what purpose? Political advantage, personal revenge or something else? Ariel Lawhon comes up with a fascinating solution that will leave you both horrified and intrigued.</p>\n<p>But <em>Flight of Dreams</em> is about much more than just what doomed the Hindenburg. In alternating chapters and points of view, Lawhon illustrates a different meaning to the word &quot;flight,&quot; as in, to get away. To flee. Different characters – a stewardess with a past, a navigator in love, a cabin boy under pressure, a paranoid journalist, a disarming businessman – reveal that they are each running away from something, whether it be a terrible secret or a heavy burden or an impossible situation.</p>\n<p>In escaping what they fear, the travelers are also hoping that the Hindenburg flight will be the start of something they long for: new love, new job, new life, new identity. Something about being in the state of travel – whether by train, plane, or car – suspends us in time, allowing us to ignore problems that are dogging us and to re-imagine our futures. And so it is for the passengers and crew of the Hindenburg, floating high in the sky, midway between the growing tensions of Nazi-Germany and a United States still naїve to Hitler's evil.  The travelers' dreams suddenly seem possible and we root for them even as we confront the chapter-by-chapter countdown to the disaster.

A rough and tumble guy who's constantly on the run, avoiding detection and setting traps for his enemies, hiding out in safe houses between dead sprints from one danger-filled situation to another? Or do you imagine a more refined gentleman, like James Bond? Sinking $150k cars in the Venice canals, after a pulse-pounding chase through narrow alleys, escaping without a scuff on his perfectly tailored tux?</p>\n<p>Douglas Laux – the undercover CIA operative behind true-life <em>Left of Boom</em> – will disabuse you that these Hollywood creations exist at all.  Laux describes his 180 degree turn in the wake of 9/11 his freshman year of college, shifting his studies from pre-med to political science, and finding himself applying for a post-grad position with the CIA. Soon, he muscles his way from a desk job to become an on-the-ground operative in Afghanistan. While he's chomping at the bit to be in the middle of the action, his fellow rookie case officers are happy to round the &quot;cocktail circuit&quot; in foreign embassies.</p>\n<p>Integrating as quickly as possible, Laux learns the local dialect of Pashtu, grows a beard, and begins dressing in traditional Afghani garb, while making contacts and infiltrating the village networks that feed Taliban growth. His aggressive approach, both in country and stateside, makes Laux a thorn in the side of his bureaucratic agency, but also makes him an extremely effective operative. He's an adrenaline junkie through and through, conjuring up a persona that will remind <em>Homeland</em> fans of the determined but high-strung Carrie Mathison.

How to express her love for the boy she raised—without minimizing the horror of his acts? Would she seem to be &quot;cashing in&quot; (despite donating profits to charity)? And would she sound defensive—not to mention clueless—if she insisted on what she believes is the truth: that Dylan, who died by his own hand on that hellish day, never showed signs of his disturbance?</p>\n<p>Not only does <em>A Mother's Reckoning</em> manage to avoid all those pitfalls, it's also a riveting read. The day Dylan was born, Sue was &quot;overcome,&quot; she writes, &quot;by a strong premonition: this child would bring me a terrible sorrow.&quot; Not the superstitious type, she shook the feeling off and watched her younger son grow into a sweet, shy boy who loved origami and plastering his mom's face with kisses. He had some unremarkable problems as a teen: periodic sullenness, indications he'd been mildly bullied at school, and finally an arrest for stealing video equipment. But by senior year he seemed to be back on track, had close friends and even took a girl to prom—&quot;the best night of my life,&quot; he told Sue afterwards—just days before his and Eric's deadly rampage.</p>\n<p>So what went wrong? Sue makes a convincing case that her 17 year old was hiding a deep depression that left him vulnerable to Eric's more active psychopathology. She urges parents and teachers to learn from her experience and to watch their teens carefully, taking even small indications of distress seriously. Dylan destroyed countless lives and shattered his family. Sue admits she will never understand his actions, but she's forged meaning amid devastation by devoting her life to mental health awareness.  You'll finish her brave book wanting to hug your children close—and applauding her.</p>\n","img":"AMothersReckoning.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>When Sue Klebold decided to write a book about her son Dylan, she set a daunting task.

I apologize for the bird pun in the very first sentence of this review, but what can I say? I'm giddy. I could not put this book down. The Plumb family is a messed-up, dysfunctional, self-obsessed unit full of messed-up dysfunctional, self-obsessed members – much like your family or mine. What makes their journey a delight to read is the way that Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney seamlessly and artfully weaves their stories together. I've always been fascinated by the fact that an artist can induce pleasure from essentially unlikeable characters, and Ms. Sweeney does just that in this captivating story.</p>\n<p>&quot;The Nest&quot; refers to the Plumb siblings' shared trust fund, which they are due to receive on the youngest sibling's 40th birthday. As is often the case with oldest siblings (I myself am the second of four – incidentally, the second child is historically regarded as the &quot;dove-like&quot; child who can &quot;do no wrong&quot;), the eldest Plumb brother goes and gets himself into an accident mere months away from this long-awaited payday. The financial consequences from this event put the entire Nest in danger, and the remaining three siblings are left scrambling as this promised jackpot disappears before their eyes.</p>\n<p>As a result of counting on this trust fund for years, the Plumb children have remained as just that: children. Their arrested development has produced any number of irresponsible life choices; Jack and Melody insist on living beyond their means to keep up appearances, Bea remains stunted in a writing career that never quite blossomed, and Leo Plumb appears to live first, foremost, and solely for himself. What the author does so masterfully in this novel is to continuously rotate the points of view; each chapter is told through a different character's eyes. In this way, the story never takes a moment's rest.</p>\n<p>While reading this book, I involuntarily assigned the cast of <em>Mad Men</em> to play the various characters. I saw John Slattery as Leo, Vincent Kartheiser as Jack, Elisabeth Moss as Melody (we would have to age her a bit, but it could work). I think this is a comment on how easily the story dances in the reader's mind; it lives and breathes and is as immediate as a theater piece playing out before your eyes. I was sad to reach the last page. I hope that Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney writes another one, very soon.</p>\n","img":"TheNest.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>The story dances in the reader's mind; it lives and breathes and is as immediate as a theater piece playing out before your eyes.</p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":2,"visible":true,"judge_id":20,"store_id":1,"in_stock":true,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":67,"authors":[114]},"112":{"id":112,"mmid":1409427,"title":"No One Knows","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":3,"year":1,"pages":368,"description_title":"Aubrey Hamilton's Husband Is Dead.

Childhood sweethearts, they were living an idyllic married life in a sleepy Tennessee town, with great jobs and a happy, companionable Weimaraner named Winston. Until the day Josh disappears. Five years after Josh's disappearance, Aubrey's monster of a mother-in-law, Daisy, has had Josh legally declared dead. Daisy has always thought that Josh was too good for Aubrey, and after he went missing, she was sure Aubrey was responsible.

I somehow got it in my head that the book was long and forbidding (it was physically heavy) and I kind of semi-consciously started to view it as homework. I try to read these days for either pleasure or edification, but a mixture of the two is what I really seek. All of which is to say I was totally wrong about <em>&amp; Sons</em>. It turned out to be a swift and gorgeous read, both nourishing and wildly entertaining.</p>\n<p><em>&amp; Sons</em> centers around a spectacularly famous though reclusive older author named Andrew &quot;A.N.&quot; Dyer, who is much more skilled as a writer than as a father. His coldness has left him adrift from his two older sons, Richard and Jamie, and in a late-in-life act of penance he attempts a do-over with his third son, seventeen-year-old Andy, the product of an affair that destroyed his marriage to Richard and Jamie's mother.</p>\n<p>The book is topically narrow (literary New York) but thematically huge, the story a prism through which Gilbert examines, well, everything: fathers and sons, husbands and wives, success and failure, aging and youth. The book starts and ends with a funeral. It's bookended by death but in its pages there's a whole lot of life. Which is not to say life, or lives, well-lived. &amp; Sons is populated by vividly drawn, well-meaning characters who can't quite say what they feel and manage to offend when their intention is the exact opposite.</p>\n<p>My father (a man very much unlike the withholding patriarch at the center of this book) and I have an ongoing, amusing debate about narrative. He is often baffled/frustrated that fictitious characters make such bone-headed illogical decisions and screw up their lives so badly. My response is that no one wants to watch people make a series of good decisions. It's inherently undramatic. Drama is about conflict and obstacle and for those elements to be present, people have to screw up. I'm not even sure I entirely believe that all the time (functional, healthy people can be dramatically compelling) but the twists and turns of <em>&amp; Sons</em> do illustrate my point.</p>\n<p>Gilbert's prose is consistently startling; I found myself underlining passages every few pages. Some of my favorites: &quot;Grace commanded the second pew, her whole family jammed together, the six of them sour and insistent, like the richest people flying coach.&quot; On Andy: &quot;...this 17 percent boy with the zit goatee and the shaggy hair and the stubborn baby fat around his middle like he was halfway through digesting his younger softer self.&quot; A character described as &quot;baseball handsome.&quot; Another: &quot;She would make a fabulous stepmother someday.&quot;</p>\n<p>Reading <em>&amp; Sons</em> reminded me of the pleasures of literary fiction, of being granted access to a rarified, insular world populated by characters I didn't know I needed in my life until they were there. My acting teacher at NYU, Ron Van Lieu, used to urge his students to &quot;expand your definitions of yourselves.&quot; This is what books are so uniquely good at – granting a backstage pass to experiences which are not our own. David Foster Wallace once said we're all marooned in our own skulls – a true, if depressing, statement. But books are the best remedy we have for this sorry state. I'm glad I'm not A.N. Dyer - or his sons - but I feel enlarged by having spent time in their company.</p>\n","img":"&Sons.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>A prism through which Gilbert examines, well, everything: fathers &amp; sons, husbands &amp; wives, success &amp; failure, aging &amp; youth.

I think this is the question we are all asking: how to live in the face of the knowledge that at any moment we could die or lose those we love to an act of terror?

In this contemporary retelling of the brewing behemoth of sexual desire that is <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> - let's not pretend otherwise - Liz Bennett has been modernized into a jaded 38-year-old magazine writer living in Brooklyn; her sister Jane is a yoga instructor, and her flame Mr. Darcy is a brain surgeon.</p>\n<p>Sittenfeld's version of the Austen classic features a lot less dancing and letter-writing than the original, and a lot more alcohol and sex. But the path to true love remains - as always - bumpy. Liz and Darcy circle each other, in ways both expected and unexpected, and even <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> devotees will be captivated by their &quot;will they or won't they?&quot; games.  Sounds perfect, right?</p>\n<p>And perfect it absolutely is. A perfectly hilarious and engaging read that will send you back to thumb through <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> to check the corresponding details. But not until you've reached the satisfying and yet still surprising ending of <em>Eligible</em>. Love really does overcome all - even reality TV.</p>\n<p>Sittenfeld offers a marvelous lesson about relationships: channeling Jane - the author, not the character - we can have it all: lust, love, friendship, and even a lasting détente with our families, to say nothing of our in-laws. And the &quot;Elizabeth or Jane&quot; test holds up perfectly for this modern adaptation. Those of you readers who identify with Elizabeth probably need to chill out a bit - don't be so judgmental! - and those of you who identify with Jane need to ease up on the yoga and try a bout of kickboxing.

He was the first American writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.  His so-called &quot;social novels,&quot; such as <em>Arrowsmith</em>, <em>Dodsworth</em>, <em>Elmer Gantry</em>, were critiques of capitalism, in particular how the working classes were exploited in the process of industrialization.  Okay, maybe that description makes the novels sound like boring political screeds but they were anything but.  Their characters were vibrant and memorable, the plots gripping.  And they were urgent, timely – even essential.</p>\n<p>So what does this have to do with Jennifer Haigh's <em>Heat and Light</em>?  In my opinion, this novel, set in a former coal town in Pennsylvania, is very much in the Lewis tradition.  Haigh's page-turning, masterful story uses the controversial topic of &quot;fracking&quot; - a modern method of drilling for natural gas that carries certain environmental risks - to probe how those who are left behind in the name of progress often get taken advantage of - even at times participating willingly in the forces that threaten their lives and livelihoods.</p>\n<p>If that sounds grim, it's because there is a lot at stake in this novel.  People who are struggling financially see a chance to get ahead by allowing the land they own to get contaminated.  But what keeps the book from being doctrinaire is how gorgeously it's written, how humane and relatable the characters are, how much we the readers root for justice and redemption. And like Lewis' work, Haigh's book is as entertaining as it is important and necessary.</p>\n<p>What do I want in a book?  Something that not only entertains me but does more than that too.  I want a book to make me think, to teach me something new, and to open my mind, which is why I am so proud to endorse Jennifer Haigh's <em>Heat and Light</em>.</p>\n","img":"Heat&Light.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>As entertaining as it is important and necessary...how gorgeously it's written, how humane and relatable the characters are, how much we the readers root for justice and redemption.</p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":4,"visible":true,"judge_id":12,"store_id":1,"in_stock":true,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":22,"authors":[119]},"117":{"id":117,"mmid":1409631,"title":"I Let You Go","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":4,"year":1,"pages":384,"description_title":"Hit-and-Run Becomes Cat-and-Mouse.

So I've been fascinated by Lindy West, an overweight, feminist writer who loves wizards and all-things Disney and spends so much time on the Internet that it is as real to her as the not-Internet.</p>\n<p>I imagined that spending time in such a person's head would be tedious. But it's hilarious. And delightful. And enlightening. Best of all, I finished <em>Shrill</em> a little less judgy than I began. Toward fat people on airplanes. Toward people terrorized by anonymous Twitter users. Toward people who like wizards.</p>\n<p>Most surprising was how relatable West's stories are. They add up to a story of someone who went from being too afraid to express herself to someone who embraces the &quot;shrill&quot; label with which she was saddled. Her writing is ALL CAPS struuuuuung out words, exclamation points, cultural references and talking about her friends as if they're famous; she takes the shallow style of Internet comment boards and harnesses them into an original, intimate voice. She manages to be self-righteous but also self-deprecating. I didn't know that fat people come out of the closet, but Lindy has a moment when she came out – when she was comfortable telling people she's fat. And I didn't know it could be so emotional and so funny.</p>\n<p>I first heard West on <em>This American Life</em> confront a troll who tormented her by pretending to be her recently deceased father, and it was brave, kind and funny – all the things that trolling someone as someone's dead dad is not. I've seen her read her stories in person, when her experience as a local standup comic helped her. But I did not imagine she could keep that level of honesty going when recounting more mundane stories about work, dating, her period.

Although this story is based in Brooklyn and my mother is in New Jersey, I felt immediately pulled into Straub's proposition: What happens when adults are left to focus on themselves while their children are trying to grow up and away?  Adulthood is one hell of an experience and no one gets it &quot;right.&quot;</p>\n<p>The story revolves around three old college friends, now in their late 40s.  Zoe and her wife have a restaurant, a home and a daughter together and once monotony sets in, they both wonder if those things are worth staying together for. Down the street, Elizabeth and Andrew, friends turned band mates turned spouses, reach a breaking point in their marriage when one of their band's cult classics may or may not mean new money and revived notoriety. Meanwhile, the daughter and son of these respective couples forge their own relationship, out from underneath the watchful eye of their parents. These characters' situations are special, but the characters themselves are still very accessible. I gravitated to them for their wit and most of all, their vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Straub writes in a way that made me feel as though she were gossiping about other families in the neighborhood over a glass of wine and a cheese plate. The characters are relatable and funny, and Straub allowed me to eavesdrop on their lives, as she takes us along their journey, inside their bedrooms, cars, and restaurants. Their neuroses, fears, and coping mechanisms (kombucha and yoga, anyone?) are laughable, both for their absurdity and for their familiarity.</p>\n<p><em>Modern Lovers</em> had me cruising through the pages, diving deeper and deeper into these characters' interiorities.  Each page is a delightful piece of the puzzle, and the fun in this family drama is watching their lives unspool and wondering if they can be knit back together. Straub creates a story that is Brooklyn-specific but manages to elegantly balance that with universal themes, like love, identity, and growing up. If you're eyeing this book for its lovely front and back covers, you will not be disappointed by what's in between.</p>\n","img":"ModernLovers.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>The fun in this family drama is watching their lives unspool and wondering if they can be knit back together.</p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":2,"visible":true,"judge_id":26,"store_id":1,"in_stock":true,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":10,"authors":[125]},"123":{"id":123,"mmid":1410111,"title":"The Veins of the Ocean","subtitle":"","pub_date":"0000-00-00","month":5,"year":1,"pages":320,"description_title":"Redemption and Peace in the Florida Keys","description":"<p>South Florida is a world unto itself. When I am there, I always marvel at the wildly diverse people. Miami, in particular, is full of strangers in a strange land, people trying so hard to create a sense of home so far from the homes they have long known.</p>\n<p>As a writer, as a child of immigrants whose parents had to create a new home in the U.S., I am endlessly curious about the lives of other displaced people. I want to know those stories of the Cubans and Haitians and Colombians and Hondurans and Filipinos and so many others who find themselves in Miami and all over this country.</p>\n<p>Patricia Engel's <em>The Veins of the Ocean</em> satisfies that curiosity with power and beauty. Reina Castillo is a young Colombian American woman living in Miami, living a half-life. She spends her weekends traveling from Miami to the South Glades Penitentiary where her brother Carlito is on death row. For seven years, Reina has imprisoned herself so that she might share some of her brother's suffering. As the novel unfolds, we learn about the Castillo family's troubled history and watch as Reina tries to free herself from that history, as she tries to learn how to live a full life, on her own terms.</p>\n<p><em>The Veins of the Ocean</em> is lush and entrancing, steeped in love and sorrow, faith and myth.  This is a novel about redemption and place and home and the bonds of family, how inescapable they are, for better and worse. This is not only Reina's story but also that of Nesto, whom she meets after she moves to the Florida Keys seeking a fresh start. Nesto, a Cuban who left his children behind on that island, is doing everything in his power to bring his family back together. He is a man who can fix things and maybe people, and who shows Reina the power of the water all around them and the power of faith.</p>\n<p>Patricia Engel is a gorgeous writer and I love the confidence of her prose. She knows the story she is telling, inside and out. She knows the story and its unfathomable depths and so that's how we experience reading this novel—fully, deeply, like an ocean.</p>\n","img":"VeinsoftheOcean.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>Lush and entrancing, steeped in love and sorrow, faith and myth...

Sixteen minutes later, the plane is in the ocean. Nine lives are lost.  The only survivors are a four-year-old boy, now the sole heir to a huge fortune, and a down-on-his luck painter named Scott.</p>\n<p>Immediately, there are questions: What caused the crash? How did a poor artist end up on the private plane of a wealthy media mogul? Does he know what caused the crash? Did he cause the crash?</p>\n<p>Scott's story is the anchor around which this compelling mystery is wrapped. Thrust into a public spotlight he never wanted, and under investigation for an accident he can't remember, Scott hides from the media and tries to retake control of his life. As he struggles to recover in the aftermath of the crash, reporters dog him everywhere he goes, spreading rumors and sharing intimate details from his life.</p>\n<p>And there's a plethora of interesting characters that add to the texture and allure of the narrative: a money manager under investigation by the SEC, a relative that could gain control of a big pile of money (and her belligerent husband), a loudmouthed talk show host, a glamorous art collector, and a security crew with military background, not to mention the plane's pilots and crewmembers.  On top of being a riveting mystery, <em>Before the Fall</em> provides a plausible, well-paced look at the ghoulish side of celebrity, with realistic depictions of the media circus, the jockeying among investigators, the invasion of privacy, and the guilt that can afflict survivors of tragedy.</p>\n<p>The thing I enjoyed most – and I enjoyed many things – is that it is a refreshing pause from the many thrillers contending for the <em>Gone Girl</em> throne. A straightforward, whodunit mystery about accountability and redemption that builds to a single incredible climax is an exhilarating rarity these days.

Their story is told in the book <em>The Enchanted Islands: A Five-year Adventure in the Galapagos</em> by Ainslie and Frances Conway.&quot;</p>\n<p>But what if the Conways were more than just failed colonists? What if they really were spies, as has been rumored? What if their seemingly hapless mission in fact a part of something more dangerous?  This is the subject of Allison Amend's new novel, in which she has re-imagined one of the stranger episodes of Galapagos history as something of an intelligence race, an ex-spy's tell-all.  The book is also the memoir of a lifelong friendship and a compelling account of the experience of a Jewish Eastern European immigrant woman in America just before World War II.</p>\n<p>The result is a novel that reads like the prequel I have always hoped for to one of my favorite Hitchcock films, <em>The Lady Vanishes</em> in which the title character, a seemingly kind old woman, turns out to be a veteran spy.</p>\n<p>When we meet Frances, the hero and narrator of <em>Enchanted Islands</em>, she is a salty retiree in a nursing home where she lives with her best friend from childhood, Rosalie. After Rosalie is honored for her &quot;work during the war,&quot; Frances, chafing with jealousy, heads off down the halls of memory, recounting her life from a childhood with Rosalie through the real account of what <em>she</em> did for her country on the Galapagos many decades before.</p>\n<p>Frances is not a terrific spy, but she is determined, and she also has a great love for the Galapagos, which at the time was a barren and desolate part of the world. The mission involves her adapting to a land with no arable farmland and no culture except that which she brings with her.  Populated with a handful of survivalists, the Galapagos colony is visited infrequently by ships bringing supplies, mail, news of the impending war in Europe, and classified communications. Frances and Ainslie have been dispatched to keep an eye on a few Germans who – it is suspected – might be sending information back to the Nazis about the Galapagos' viability as a stopover point between Japan and the U.S.'s crucial but relatively undefended territory in the Panama Canal. Frances' initial excitement about the mission – keeping the Galapagos out of the hands of the enemies and preserving it as a potential American base – is quickly subsumed by the everyday hardships of surviving on an island with almost no resources.</p>\n<p>The mission also strands her in an arranged marriage with a handsome man about a decade younger than her. But they learn to make do, and soon enough, fall into an &quot;arrangement&quot; that suits them and their mission both. Frances is a fascinating character, a woman society otherwise had no use for, who finds a way to become essential, first to herself, then to others. By turns funny, moving, and suspenseful, it is an adventure of several kinds set at the edge of the world with an unforgettable heroine.</p>\n","img":"EnchantedIslands.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>The author has re-imagined one of the stranger episodes of Galapagos history as something of an intelligence race, an ex-spy's tell-all.</p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":5,"visible":true,"judge_id":22,"store_id":1,"in_stock":true,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":33,"authors":[128]},"126":{"id":126,"mmid":1409341,"title":"The After Party","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","month":5,"year":1,"pages":333,"description_title":null,"description":"<p>Did you ever have a friend who you couldn't help but envy?

All my life, my mother gave me a sense of unconditional loving. This meant that even as I was going for my dreams, I knew that if I failed she wouldn't love me any less. And that made me less afraid to fail.</p>\n<p>As a mother, I loved Ron Fournier's &quot;Love That Boy,&quot; and while it's a book about parenting, its lessons are universal. At its core, this book is an honest, moving mediation on the meaning of unconditional love ? about the expectations we bring to the relationships in our lives, and how we square those expectations with the real, flesh-and-blood human beings who mean the most to us and challenge us.</p>\n<p>Fournier, a father of three, is a seasoned political journalist, with decades spent covering or overseeing coverage of national politics. As he admits, it's &quot;an ego-inflating career that I often put ahead of my wife and kids.&quot; His wakeup call comes when his son, Tyler, is diagnosed with Asperger's at age 12. The boy is socially awkward and -- to Fournier's deep disappointment and frustration -- doesn't share his father's love of sports. With the diagnosis, Fournier at last begins to confront a hard, essential truth. &quot;When a parent's expectations come from the wrong place and are pressed into service of the wrong goals, kids get hurt,&quot; he writes. &quot;I discovered this late in my job as a father.&quot;</p>\n<p>For Fournier, the breakthrough comes when he and Tyler discover a shared passion for presidential history. At his wife's urging, father and son set out on a series of road trips -- bonding tours, really -- visiting presidential sites across the country.</p>\n<p>But what I find truly refreshing, and what I'm most grateful for, is that this book transcends the political divisions of our time: love, expectations, disappointment, and longing, it turns out, are beyond left-and-right. Fournier and Tyler meet with Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. On Fournier's last day covering the White House for the Associated Press, he introduces Tyler, not yet diagnosed, to President Bush. The meeting is as awkward as Fournier can imagine. As he's leaving, though, President Bush gives him a piece of advice he'll remember for the rest of his life: &quot;love that boy.&quot;</p>\n","img":"LoveThatBoy.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>While it's a book about parenting, its lessons are universal...an honest, moving meditation on the meaning of unconditional love.</p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":1,"visible":true,"judge_id":30,"store_id":1,"in_stock":true,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":16,"authors":[130]},"128":{"id":128,"mmid":1410440,"title":"Missing, Presumed","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"0000-00-00","month":6,"year":1,"pages":346,"description_title":"Not Just Another Police Procedural - Or Is It?","description":"<p>A beautiful young Cambridge grad named Edith Hind, vanishes from her house on a snowy winter night, leaving behind her cell phone, her keys, her coat, a broken wine glass, and some drops of blood.

Manon navigates the stress, bureaucracy and cafeteria meals of her job to solve some of the agency's most vexing mysteries, and spends her free time going on terrible internet dates.</p>\n<p>Although Edith is offstage as the plot develops, Manon's dogged and deft investigation allows us to develop a portrait of the missing woman: clever, earnest, and spoiled, a little dramatic and a little self-dramatizing, capable of immense selfishness and endearing kindness, of callousness and tremendous feeling. The characters' competing perspectives on Edith and her motives keep the story speeding forward. The many false leads along the way add to the excitement.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the beauty of this book is less about plot than about its insights into unexpected connections between people. Whatever resolutions the characters may find by the end of the book are not the kind they've been seeking -- or the kind we're expecting.</p>\n<p>Touches like these elevate <em>Missing, Presumed</em> far beyond a boilerplate police procedural into a work of art.

Emma Cline's <em>The Girls</em> is one of those wonderful life-interrupting novels that contains too many perfectly written sentences to read in one sitting, as tempting as it might be.</p>\n<p>At first the premise of <em>The Girls</em> gave me pause. I feared that this novel about a teenage girl who joins a Manson Family-like cult in California in the summer of 1969 would be a cheap-thrills horror read, disturbing, the stuff of nightmares. And yes, some of it is macabre (when you're talking about a cult of young women who commit horrific murders for an evil hippie guru, it has to be!) But Cline keeps the violence to a minimum, and only where it's necessary. Turns out, <em>The Girls</em> is not a cheap, voyeuristic thrill at all, but a lovely meditation about the helter skelter of girlhood, about suburban boredom and the agonies of loneliness, of feeling like the life you're really meant to live is way off in a distant future you can barely imagine. And how thrilling it feels when that bit of life suddenly comes into focus, even if you have to squint very hard to see it.</p>\n<p>&quot;Maybe this was a better way, even though it seemed alien,&quot; thinks 14 year-old Evie upon experiencing the welcoming disarray of the commune for the first time. &quot;To be part of this amorphous group, believing love could come from any direction. So you wouldn't be disappointed if not enough came from the direction you'd hoped.&quot; Even though I knew this magical time in Evie's life would end poorly (to say the least!) I couldn't help relating to Evie's longing for connection ? in whatever form it might take.</p>\n<p>And through Evie I was able to see how a &quot;good girl&quot; can be drawn towards darkness, feelings anyone who has ever been a teenage girl will relate to on some level.

Friends are our first loves— the first time we get to say to another person, &quot;I choose <em>you</em>.&quot; The first time we feel ourselves chosen. It's such a rush, that recognition, the thrill of a kindred spirit. No wonder our early friendships imprint so strongly: the blurred boundaries, the shared history, the intimacy and neediness that can be both intoxicating and stifling. But, oh, the burden of choice! Because what to do when lives start to diverge and it might be time to <em>unchoose</em>?</p>\n<p>Sarah and Lauren, the main characters in this book, have been friends since they were teens. In their early thirties now, they are both convinced the other is navigating adulthood in New York City in all the wrong ways and, as a result, their friendship has suffered. &quot;Like sisters!&quot; everyone has said of these two, except they're not like sisters in one critical way. Unlike sisters, they can choose to uncouple without having to worry about the inevitable holiday gatherings or family command performances. They can continue to neglect their friendship until it's a husk of its former self, or until they drift so far apart they are no longer in each other's sights. Will they? Won't they?</p>\n<p>What makes this book such a great read is how Rumaan Alam excavates the interior lives of these women with wit and compassion and an extraordinary eye for the defining details of their individual—and shared—worlds. Not to mention his downright uncanny ear for how friends communicate: what's spoken versus what's implied, the comforting shorthand, the facile barb, the easy affection.</p>\n<p>I have exactly zero science to back this up, but I believe-anecdotally and in my gut-that women spend more time pining over (and Googling and Facebook stalking) ex-friends than ex-lovers. (<em>Just me?</em>) It's painful to lose people, but sometimes it's more painful to hold on.

I was initially intrigued by the fact that it is set in Kenya, as that is one of only five countries in Africa to which I've traveled. I knew little else when I started reading, but found that I relished every single page. It became the anthem to my summer -- my reason to anticipate bedtime with excitement and curiosity, when I could have my nightly check-in with this fascinating protagonist who alternately frustrated and inspired me.  This is the amazing story of real woman's life (please don't look her up online - it might spoil the story of her wonderfully unpredictable journey!)</p>\n<p>In 1904, a three year-old named Beryl moves from England to Kenya (before it was &quot;Kenya&quot;) with her mother, father and brother. Two years later, her mother and older brother return to England (for reasons I am reluctant to reveal - no spoilers!), leaving Beryl in Kenya to be raised by her father, who trains horses and runs a farm.  Growing up adjacent to and immersed in several families from the Kipsigis tribe, Beryl becomes an aspiring young warrior (having never absorbed Western expectations of girlhood), passionate racehorse trainer, and adventurer. We first meet her, in a flash-forward prologue, while she's performing her ultimate occupation: pilot.</p>\n<p>Beryl's aviation prowess — she makes history by becoming the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic from east to west — seems nearly impossible to imagine as the story of her early life begins. By giving us a glimpse into her future, the author sets us up for an amazing journey as I found myself asking: <i>How on Earth is this where Beryl ends up? </i> McLain challenges us with the ending that we know is coming, and she thwarts every effort to make sense of it all before it's time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/magazine/post/150\" class=\"h5 alt link\">Read our exclusive Q&amp;A with Guest Judge Allison Williams here</a></p>\n<p>It helps that this book is beautifully written. As an English major, I am a stickler for grammar, syntax, structure, and language. I found myself highlighting many of her stunning phrases. An example:</p>\n<p><i> &quot;While a leopard moth that had got caught in the curtains stopped struggling for a moment, and realized it was free.&quot; </i></p>\n<p>Grammatically, this sentence is...problematic. However, I was repeatedly struck by the beauty and profundity of McLain's imagery. It is likely that the language is <i>deliberately</i> rough, for the &quot;world&quot; of the novel is a rough one with moments of sheer beauty. This description also applies to the protagonist.</p>\n<p>Beryl is, after all, wonderfully unpolished and irreverent. She is brave and naïve - a combination that proves both disastrous and fortuitous as she moves through her life. My favorite moments are those in which McLain draws comparisons between Beryl and both wild animals and Africa itself:</p>\n<p><i> &quot;[a lion] can only be exactly what he is, what his nature dictates, and nothing else.&quot; </i></p>\n<p><i> &quot;...that was something I loved about Africa. The way it got at you from outside in and never let up, and never let you go.&quot; </i></p>\n<p>Beryl is torn between two worlds -an English girl born at the turn of the twentieth century, she is also naturally and thoroughly wild. It is unknown to us or others whether her wildness is nature or nurture, but I'm inclined to say that it is both. The inevitability of her (and everyone else's) path is the central drive of the novel.</p>\n<p><i> &quot;It was possible everyone ended up in the same place no matter which path we took or how often we fell to our knees, undoubtedly wiser for all of it.&quot;</i></p>\n<p>Read this book for an emotional vacation to a fascinating moment in world history. Read it to be astounded by the human spirit's ability to conquer so much. Read it to be inspired by bravery in the face of true mortal danger. Read it for the romance! Read it because it happened.

No way for anyone guilty (or innocent) to escape in middle of the ocean.  A crime that can't be verified.  And a narrator that you <em>might</em> be able to trust.</p>\n<p>In fact, reading this book reminded me a bit of <em>Death on the Nile</em> for the modern age.  But in <em>Woman in Cabin 10</em>, the boat is a state-of-the art cruise ship on its maiden voyage in the North Sea.  And, of course, instead of a Belgian detective solving the crime, there's a U.K. travel journalist handling a lot more thrills, chills, and action.</p>\n<p>There's also an intriguing psychological aspect to this book.  As our protagonist Lo Blacklock discovers that no one believes her account of a crime she thinks she witnessed, she struggles with cycles of disbelief and self-doubt as she decides what to do next.  Armed only with her reporter's investigative skills and a very small clue, she is determined to solve the mystery before the boat reaches its destination.</p>\n<p>The author, up-and-coming novelist Ruth Ware, teases out each twist and turn just enough, so everything you read could <em>possibly</em> have something to do with whatever it is that's actually happening on the boat.  But she isn't going to let you in on the answer until the end.  It was so much fun trying to figure out the mystery! The answer was ten times more interesting than any of my running theories.

In <em>Dark Matter</em>, Blake Crouch doesn't just build a world: he builds a whole multiverse in which various versions of the world exist simultaneously, with a very singular love story at its core. Crouch  makes you feel as smart as a scientist, even though you may remember almost nothing from high school physics. With his clear, crisp prose, you might even grasp enough quantum mechanics theory that you won't ever have to open up Google to fully understand. And, with your science knowledge up to speed, he takes you on an incredibly action-packed and winding journey that doesn't let up for a second.</p>\n<p><em>Dark Matter</em> is the story of Jason Dessen, an intensely devoted family man with a lackluster career.  One day he's abducted by a mysterious stranger, and every assumption he'd had about his life is yanked away. He finds himself in a disorienting world both similar and different from his &quot;real&quot; life.  But the power of love is so strong that Dessen is willing to endure a long, strange quest to find his way home and rejoin his family.</p>\n<p>Paced like a thriller, <em>Dark Matter</em> is also surprisingly philosophical; at its core is this question: &quot;If you strip away all the trappings of personality and lifestyle, what are the core components that make me me?&quot; The scope of the novel can seem infinitely huge, but Crouch's protagonist remains relatable and reachable even as the story twists and turns to mind-bending extremes. The action barely stops, but the conclusion remains immensely satisfying even after you've caught your breath and returned back to our own universe.</p>\n","img":"DarkMatter.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>The author doesn't just build a world: he builds a whole multiverse, with a very singular love story at its core.</p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":3,"visible":true,"judge_id":29,"store_id":1,"in_stock":true,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":137,"authors":[139]},"140":{"id":140,"mmid":1410764,"title":"All the Ugly and Wonderful Things","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","month":7,"year":1,"pages":346,"description_title":"A BEAUTIFUL, MAGICAL (AND EFFED UP) FAIRY TALE","description":"<p>Prepare yourself for one of the strangest but also one of the most genuine, and unforgettable, love stories you'll ever read.  Bryn Greenwood's pristine, evocative writing is perfect for creating this deeply hypnotic tale about love found in the most unlikely of places - a backwoods meth lab in the rural Midwest.</p>\n<p>Wavy is the daughter of a man who runs the meth lab.  Her circumscribed world is woefully bereft of anything wonderful; her short life has been a daisy chain of abuse, abandonment, and hopelessness.  When we first meet her, she is just a child, already deeply scarred by mistreatment at the hands of her drug-addled mother and drug-producing father. An unlikely rescuer appears in the shape of Kellen, the hired muscle at the lab, an over-sized misfit just as damaged as Wavy - but more than twice her age.  Wavy is so starved for love and affection that her heart opens to Kellen, and Kellen cannot help but enter into the relationship she offers him.</p>\n<p>It is a strange sensation to be rooting for a little girl and the much older thug who goes beyond rescuer to become her lover.  But amid all the very ugly things in the world these two inhabit (very, very ugly), their connection is the only wonderful thing they have.  If you fell for the fairy tale of Beauty and the Beast (and who didn't?) you will fall for this very offbeat pair.  So I found myself wishing the couple happiness through their many trials. The course of true love never runs easy, not in fairy tales and certainly not in the very real, very grim world the two lovers inhabit.</p>\n<p><em>All the Ugly and Wonderful Things</em> is the ultimate noir fairy tale, with Wavy as the wounded beauty, small and blonde, abused in body and spirit, and Kellen as the beast, big and hulking but just as broken. The evil father, wasted mother, and other family members, all have their roles to play - and they all impart truths that move the book along at a fast and mesmerizing pace.</p>\n<p>I read this stunning book in one go. It was well worth giving up a night of sleep to become part of this strange tale of love unfolding in an ugly world.  Because in the end, no matter just how wrong Wavy and Kellen are for each other in so many ways, in the most important way, they are just so right.</p>\n","img":"AllTheUglyWonderful.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>The ultimate noir fairy tale...if you fell for Beauty and the Beast (and who didn't?) you will fall for this very offbeat pair.</p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":4,"visible":true,"judge_id":2,"store_id":1,"in_stock":true,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":91,"authors":[140]},"141":{"id":141,"mmid":1409991,"title":"Siracusa","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"0000-00-00","month":7,"year":1,"pages":366,"description_title":"DIRTY WEEKEND IN SICILY...WHAT COULD GO WRONG?","description":"<p>&quot;Travel rocks your perspective,&quot; says Finn, one of five characters vacationing together in this delicious new novel. That's putting it mildly: by the time Finn, his wife Taylor, their daughter Snow and their friends Lizzie and Michael are back home in the U.S. , their worlds will be turned upside down. This much is clear from the outset, so half the fun here is trying to predict what deceit could be lurking as the vacationers sun, drink and quarrel in Siracusa, a down-at-the-heels seaside town on the eastern coast of Sicily.</p>\n<p>The novel is a stew of domestic intrigue.  Will Lizzie, a New York magazine writer with dwindling assignments, rekindle her romance with Finn, the grizzled Maine restaurateur? Will Finn's wife Taylor, the frosty privileged beauty from NYC's Upper East Side, even notice? Could Michael, Lizzie's successful-author husband, be harboring secrets of his own? And what's the deal with nearly-silent 10-year-old Snow, who's constantly glued to her smothering mom and exudes an obscure air of menace?</p>\n<p>Told rashomon-style, with chapters alternating among the four adults' viewpoints, the story moves at a satisfying clip. But it's more than suspense that makes the book such a treat. Delia Ephron, a playwright and screenwriter as well as a novelist, excels at spritely dialogue and has a keen eye for the pleasures and pitfalls of long marriages. Her observations on that score are hilarious. &quot;I joke that sex is rhubarb,&quot; Taylor confides at one point. &quot;Something I forget I like and then I taste it and remember, I like this, but then I forget all over again.&quot;</p>\n<p>The violent denouement, when it comes, feels both shocking and utterly believable. Knocked off balance by their foreign surroundings, the characters fall prey to their darker impulses, and the consequences aren't pretty.

And so when <em>Vanity Fair</em> assigned me, in the spring of 1992, to profile the author of that fall's big, hot novel, a first novel that had fetched an advance of close to a million dollars, my initial reaction, as a recent first-novelist myself who had garnered some moderately good reviews and sold a couple of thousand books, was envious and dismissive.</p>\n<p>Until I read the novel in question: Donna Tartt's <em>The Secret History</em>.</p>\n<p>From the first sentence—<em>The snow in the mountains was melting and Bunny had been dead for several weeks before we came to understand the gravity of our situation</em>—I was drawn almost feverishly into what turned out to be, of all things, an intellectual thriller: a murder mystery whose core characters were a group of classicists at a small New England college, likely to break out at any moment into Latin or Attic Greek; a page-turner that made easy reference to T. S. Eliot, Pliny, and A. E. Housman—and, just as easily, to TV, movies, and fast food.</p>\n<p>The book was infused with the thrill of the life of the mind, but its true secret was that its pleasures were visceral. The plot was dark and breathless and tumbling, the writing simple and clean and compelling, filled with images so beautiful they cleared the nasal passages. Repressed sexuality—of all kinds—ran like a river of hot lava throughout, now and then bursting into startling flame.</p>\n<p>Who could have produced such a work? The author, it turned out, was a piece of work herself: tiny and mildly androgynous in her boy's clothes, with dark bobbed hair, spooky pale-green eyes, an ever-present Marlboro Gold, and an ever-flowing stream of quotations from Buddha and Plato and Thomas Aquinas, from A. A. Milne and Talking Heads. Tartt came from a tiny hamlet in deepest Mississippi, and she had pledged Kappa Kappa Gamma at Ole Miss before transferring to Bennington, the intellectual-bohemian hothouse of a college in chilly Vermont which bore more than a passing resemblance to Hampden College, <em>The Secret History's</em> Gothic setting.</p>\n<p>Surely, I thought, Donna Tartt's own unusual life was a key to the book's puzzles. Yet she deftly parried my biographical prying, salting the basic information she vouchsafed with ever more entertaining quotations and references, cocking her head teasingly like the rare and strange bird she was.</p>\n<p>Tiny feathered creatures, it turned out, meant a great deal to her. One in particular: &quot;Goldfinches are the <em>greatest</em> little birds,&quot; she told me then. &quot;They're the last to settle down—they just fly around and they're happy for a long time, and just sing and play. And only when it's <em>insanely</em> late in the year, they kind of break down and build their nests. I love goldfinches — they're my favorite bird.&quot;</p>\n<p>Two decades later, of course, Tartt would publish a Pulitzer Prize-winning third novel called <em>The Goldfinch</em>. Could she have had any inkling in 1992 in which direction her work would take her? Good writers know how to keep their secrets.</p>\n","img":"SecretHistory.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>The snow in the mountains was melting and Bunny had been dead for several weeks before we came to understand the gravity of our situation.</p>\n","featured":0,"exclusive":0,"position":6,"visible":true,"judge_id":null,"store_id":1,"in_stock":true,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":0,"authors":[143]},"143":{"id":143,"mmid":1400929,"title":"The Wright Brothers","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","month":8,"year":1,"pages":368,"description_title":null,"description":"<p>A &quot;practical flying machine&quot; is something humankind had dreamt of for thousands of years by the time Wilbur and Orville grew up in the late 1800s.

You felt the warm glow of the gas lantern, the luxurious texture of the ball gown, the sting of the cold night air as the horse-drawn carriage carried weary passengers home in the wee hours, after the ball, and the call of history, and war.</p>\n<p><em>A Gentleman in Moscow</em> carries this lavish sensibility through to post-revolution Russia, as the new Soviet Government assumes power in 1922. Amor Towles (whose first novel is the sublime <em>Rules of Civility</em>), this time delivers a novel as richly filigreed as the set design of the film <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em>.  And indeed, <em>A Gentleman in Moscow</em> takes place entirely within its own hotel grande dame, The Metropol.  Our hero, Count Alexander Illyich Rostov has been sentenced to live out the rest of his life there by the Commissariat for Internal Affairs, which had deemed aristocrats to be enemies of the people.  Under threat of being shot if he as much as steps outside the walls of the Metropol, the debonair and irrepressible Count sets about recreating his life within this gentleman's prison, an effort that takes all of his boundless inventiveness and good humor.  There is much to delight in—even laugh out loud at—in the Count's circumscribed adventures-but even he can't keep tragedy from encroaching.</p>\n<p>While the story is, literally speaking, narrowly drawn, in overarching terms the book depicts Russian society making the painful transition from tsarist autocracy to Soviet communism.  Everything and everyone is forced to change—not least Count Rostov. But this book's pleasures are in the details.  What Count Rostov never loses is his appreciation for life's gorgeous details—sharing a freshly made cup of coffee while gazing at the night sky; conversation with an Eloise-like hotel denizen; a great meal accompanied by fine wine, followed by the company, late into the night, of  a piece of great literature.</p>\n<p>I can't begin to tell you how much I loved this book.  It is layered with delicious, minute observation, so that you never want to skip over passages.

But Aitkenhead proves herself wrong again and again. Sad but true, when terrible things happen to brilliant writers we become privy to insights into the human condition that couldn't be articulated by those with less talent for words. <em>All at Sea</em> is a beautiful sublimation of grief in the wake of tragedy.</p>\n<p>But the book is also the uplifting story of a most unlikely and powerful love affair between two remarkable people.  Aitkenhead, a longtime reporter for <em>The Guardian</em>, is fiercely honest about her relationship with her beloved late partner, Tony. Tony is a man worthy of a memoir even if his ending hadn't been tragic: as a drug dealer and crack addict, Tony lives a hustler's life, taking care of &quot;business&quot; at night and waking in the late afternoon (when he's not serving time in jail).  But when he and Decca meet, attraction is visceral, and Tony changes his life when they decide to have children together. Her portrait of him is remarkable: she sees all of his flaws and is not afraid to expose his weaknesses, but she also clearly loves and admires him and finds him utterly charming, and so, then, the reader does as well. That Tony drowned trying to save their son from a squall makes him a hero in newspaper articles, but he was a hero in Decca's eyes long before he passed away.</p>\n<p>Aitkenhead is self-conscious about the act of writing, about how she must turn these devastating events into a narrative that is both accurate and compelling. Writing so recently after Tony's death (in 2014) seems dangerous given how little distance she's had: &quot;Death is too much for the mind to register in a matter of minutes; the incalculable magnitude can only be absorbed by increment, day by day,&quot; she writes.

This dazzling debut revolves around two very different New York families in a familiar and inevitably fraught relationship: the wealthy privileged employer, and the aspiring immigrant employee. The beauty of the book resides in the voices of the latter.</p>\n<p>The story is told from the viewpoint of the ebullient Jende Jonga, an immigrant from Cameroon, and his wife, Neni, who recently joined her husband in America with their young son. Their dream? A green card for Jende; a future in America. When Jende is hired as a chauffeur for a high-flying Lehman Brothers executive and his wife and two sons, it seems like the luckiest of breaks. But soon the two families will become entwined in ways that are both fruitful and destructive.</p>\n<p>Once I started this book, I couldn't stop. I fell in love with Jende and Neni, their friends and relatives, their New York. I was deeply invested in their joy and sacrifice, determination and hope. I was bereft when I reached the last page because I didn't want to let go of their story. I still hear their voices in my head, still wonder what they're doing and if they're happy.</p>\n<p>That Mbue manages to deftly turn critical issues like immigration, marital conflict and class disparity into a revelatory page-turner is a testament to her storytelling gifts, which are immense.

Visceral? Riveting? Heart-wrenching? In the end this novel is all three and then some. <em>The Mothers</em> opens with a chorus of a collective female voice that divulges the tragic history of beautiful Nadia Turner. Years ago, her mother, Elise, committed suicide just moments after leaving their church, and now both Nadia and her father are left to deal with Elise's &quot;unfinished business.&quot; Nadia must make her way even as her church congregation suspects that madness has cursed the Turner family to make unwise decisions in both life and love.</p>\n<p>The question I kept asking myself as I read the novel is how free am I from my mother's choices? How free am I from the choices I made when I was younger and will I ever have to account for them in the future? In <em>The Mothers</em>, the past has the presence of a character-- it moves and changes just as Nadia does. At seventeen years old, Nadia falls in love with a fellow church member and loses her virginity to him. She winds up pregnant, and chooses to have an abortion, a decision that haunts the couple for years to come. Brit Bennett's voice is consistently charged with energy and yet simultaneously, her words have the kind of warmth and familiarity as though the novel was a secret being told by your closest friend.</p>\n<p><em>The Mothers</em> is a story about black women's sexuality and cultural judgment within a black church in California, in which female virgins are considered to be more prized and favored by God than those who are not. Men are exempt from this kind of communal judgment. Each line that Bennett produces cracks open with more intensity in order to ask over and over again: What if? The past and the present converge with each blossoming subplot until you begin to wonder what &quot;mistakes&quot; you've made in the past that changed your future, and whether or not you will have to grapple with them. <em>The Mothers</em> is a rollercoaster ride that picks up very quickly even while maintaining its complexity as it moves through the interwoven journeys of Brit Bennett's unforgettable characters.</p>\n","img":"Mothers.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>Brit Bennett's words have the kind of warmth and familiarity as though the novel was a secret being told by your closest friend.</p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":2,"visible":true,"judge_id":26,"store_id":1,"in_stock":true,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":45,"authors":[151]},"171":{"id":171,"mmid":1412297,"title":"The Fall Guy","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"0000-00-00","month":9,"year":1,"pages":256,"description_title":"Armchair Therapists, Be Warned","description":"<p>My favorite hobby, if I'm being honest, is hyper-analyzing. I love analyzing my own life decisions as well as those of my friends.  (Sometimes I even offer my own uninvited opinions —to mixed effect!)  Being a habitual reader provides a welcoming outlet, a continuous stream of new 'friends' to analyze.</p>\n<p>And in this sense, <em>The Fall Guy</em> is doozy!  It's a deeply psychological novel where much of the action takes place inside the characters' heads.  As tension builds over the course of a long hot summer at a country house in upstate New York, there was much for me to scrutinize.  And when—BANG—things boil over to disastrous effect, it's that much more satisfying.</p>\n<p>Matthew, <em>The Fall Guy's</em> protagonist, has been to a therapist or two, and that means he's also been instructed to assess his actions. A tumultuous upbringing saw him plucked from the English upper class when his father disappeared and left him penniless. Now, Matthew, a chef talented in the kitchen but a failure as a restauranteur, struggles to find comfortable footing in his adult years. Knowing his backstory made his insecurities endearing to me and yet, something seems a bit off with Matthew...</p>\n<p>When Matthew heads to his cousin Charlie's summer home, presumably to provide entertainment and delicious meals for Charlie and his wife, harmless miscommunications fester and old harmful family dynamics reemerge. This is the stuff of amazing armchair-therapist fodder. At first, I read the book slowly, wondering if Matthew's grasp on his own motivations and others' actions was as accurate as he himself seems to think.</p>\n<p>At a certain point, as the book's perspective widens, things start to veer off course, and this is where I started reading really, really fast. To put it briefly: shit hits the fan. Though the fan is totally not what you think, it's like a different fan in a different room, or maybe a different house altogether. That, my friends, is how the second half of this book catches you off guard, changes gears, and becomes a thriller.</p>\n<p>To the credit of James Lasdun's amazing and unexpected character development, I had a lot wrong.

I could not put it down. My heart was racing and my thoughts were percolating and enjoyment oozed from every pore as I sunk into Zink’s unadulterated good-time storytelling.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t help but love Penny Baker, recent college grad of pure heart with zero prospects, a taste for cigarettes, and a preference for bone jewelry and drum circle dancing.  She’s steeped in grief following the death of her father – an event that took weeks of hospice care (Zink skewers the promise of “a good death” with sharp insights and surprising humor) and Penny was bedside for the entire thing, while the other members of her family largely bailed out due to commitments like work and ambition and greed, concepts utterly foreign to our dear Penny.</p>\n<p>Penny needs love and comfort but instead her eager-to-move-on family members throw her the bone of a long-abandoned family house in Jersey City.

Her patience (lack of resolve), determination (stubbornness), and flexibility (indecision) get her to the place where she wants to be, in the home where she was meant to be and with the people she needs.</p>\n<p>A glorious and surprising ending after a twisting and satisfying ride: the act of reading a good book offers the rush of a good smoke at half the price of a carton of cigarettes, and with none of the associated health risks and no pariah status.

Rather than feature the same hero over and over again, in each book a new detective takes center stage. This allows the tone and perspective to change, even though the fast-pacing and intricate plotting remain consistent.</p>\n<p><em>The Trespasser</em>, the sixth novel in the series, comes with a fresh edge: not only is protagonist Antoinette Crowley a woman (the only one on Murder Squad), she’s a mixed race woman.  Working on the Squad is Crowley’s dream and she’s damn good at it, but she has to be “four times as good” (as the writer Roxane Gay would put it) as her white male co-workers. So while her colleagues waste their time pissing in her locker, stealing her witness reports or otherwise trying to intimidate her, she can’t afford to be shaken—she must handle her cases with the utmost, jaw-clenching seriousness.</p>\n<p>Antoinette’s case is a seemingly routine domestic murder that, as they tend to do in great thrillers, becomes way more complex than it originally seems. And the victim, or what we learn of her in life, is a fascinating, twisted woman in her own right. Antoinette puts on a brave face, but might be flawed narrator as well – is she being paranoid, or are her co-workers actually trying to impede her investigation?  Come for the cool women and their complicated stories, stay for the hilarious descriptions of entitled men.</p>\n<p>The timing for this novel could not be more apropos, as our country is poised elect our first female president. Now, I’ve never investigated a murder (or run for president!), but the micro and macro aggressions that plague Antoinette at work feel more than relevant to my own life.

The genre is so expansive that it welcomes sleuths of all stripes (literally in the case of cat mysteries).  What I most love about crime novels is how they introduce me to new worlds and shows the way into how we live now and how societies function (or more often, don't). When chaos surrounds us in real life, even fictional chaos offers a much needed escape for the tired, despairing reader. And when you're guided on a tour of dark doings and double dealings by the likes of Patrick Hoffman, the jolts are all the more electric and the windows into secret places resonate all the more.</p>\n<p>Hoffman worked as a private investigator in San Francisco and now in Brooklyn. As a result, <em>Every Man a Menace</em> rings true, whether or not the action happens in the Bay Area, Miami, or Bangkok. The drug called Ecstasy in my youth – now known as “Molly” – unites all of the characters, whether they are snorting it, selling it, stealing it, or getting killed for it. For a drug that professes to give pleasure, the pain  is major-league.</p>\n<p>As for plot, imagine a younger, edgier Elmore Leonard, a pinch of <em>Pulp Fiction</em> and a dose of <em>Traffic</em>, and you get the idea. There are plenty of cautionary tales here, but Hoffman is no moralizer— the thrills and kills always come first.  And Hoffman’s voice – knowing, wry, caustic, but not too cynical – always held my attention. Crime fiction thrives on fresh voices above all, and Hoffman is one of the freshest out there at the moment. I can't wait to see what secret world he lets us in on next.</p>\n","img":"Menace.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>The drug known as “Molly” unites all of the characters, whether they are snorting it, selling it, stealing it, or getting killed for it.</p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":null,"visible":true,"judge_id":39,"store_id":1,"in_stock":true,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":29,"authors":[160]},"180":{"id":180,"mmid":1412780,"title":"Swing Time","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","month":10,"year":1,"pages":454,"description_title":"The Dancer from the Dance","description":"<p>Zadie Smith means different things to different people. Some arrive at her novels first, like the ambitious family saga <em>White Teeth</em>, finding a self-assured voice that marked her as an immediate fiction talent. Others discovered Zadie Smith the versatile cultural critic who could write a loving review for the 50 Cent movie <em>Get Rich or Die Tryin’</em>. Smith is an ambidextrous writer—perhaps just a natural talent at everything—who remains a venerable and beloved literary figure.</p>\n<p><em>Swing Time</em> will surprise no one—and I mean that with the highest praise. The book feels like the culmination of all her talents: a novel with a gift for character and dialogue, a story rooted in a deep cultural and racial awareness. At its core, Swing Time is about two black girls raised in the same public housing complex in London. Tracey is a dancer; the other (never named) wishes she could dance, but is raised by intellectuals who instead push her to understand her black consciousness. “All that matters in this world is what’s written down,” her mother explains. Then, gesturing at her body: “that will never matter, not in this culture, not for these people.”</p>\n<p>The book is long, but it moves quickly. Smith has composed her novel out of short scenes, little moments of funny dialogue and seemingly benign interactions that add up to a sophisticated portrait of friendship. As Tracey and the narrator grow up, they grow apart. The narrator ends up working for a pop star named Aimee, a job that takes her all over the world, and eventually to a village in West Africa, where she oversees her boss’s well-intentioned but ill-conceived philanthropy work. While it starts with a narrow view of the two friends, the novel broadens in scope and ultimately has a perspective on epic proportions of wealth and also devastating poverty. But through it all, her falling out with Tracey always lingers in her mind.</p>\n<p>Like any good story about dancing, <em>Swing Time</em> is possessed by its interest in the human body and the way it moves. The title of the book references a Fred Astaire movie wherein Astaire dances in blackface. And yet, the narrator can’t help but adore <em>Swing Time</em> —an irony that hangs over the entire novel. As she explains in the book’s opening pages, it’s the dancing that’s most important in a musical: “The story was the price you paid for the rhythm.” Think of Zadie Smith’s <em>Swing Time</em> as a corrective, where both the story and the rhythm are total joys.</p>\n","img":"SwingTime.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>The book feels like the culmination of all her talents: a gift for character and dialogue, a story rooted in a deep cultural and racial awareness</p>\n","featured":1,"exclusive":0,"position":null,"visible":true,"judge_id":35,"store_id":1,"in_stock":true,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":10,"authors":[158]},"181":{"id":181,"mmid":1413029,"title":"A Gambler's Anatomy","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","month":10,"year":1,"pages":289,"description_title":"Rolling the Dice When Things Fall Apart","description":"<p>I’ve travelled through most parts of the world, eaten in some of its greatest restaurants and cooked in some decidedly terrible ones, with many, many stops in between.

The entire industry reacted—either with entertained amusement or with shocked anger. When the article became the book, rumors were flying about the controversial exposes and I was told repeatedly that Le Bernardin was mentioned several times. So I read the book—the first book I ever read in English—and was certainly surprised: Anthony only had compliments for Le Bernardin—we were one of the lucky few! The world he described, the unpolished-side of the kitchen filled with pirates and unsavory characters and their tattoos and taste for trouble, was eye-openingly different from the regimented, almost-militant kitchens of my own experience. I needed to know more…</p>\n<p>I decided to call Anthony and invite him to lunch; we got along very well and a friendship began. It wasn’t long before we’d spend evenings away from our restaurants in Anthony’s favorite subterranean dive bars, listening to obscure punk music on old jukeboxes. These places were definitely out of my element, but it was worth the venture to learn more about the industry underbelly that he spoke of in <em>Kitchen Confidential</em> and gain a deeper insight into Anthony’s personality. He is a widely intelligent man whose knowledge spans such a vast range of topics—you see it often in his shows as he circles around the relationships between food and a region’s political, social, and cultural development. The dude is smart. He also is deeply caring and has an unparalleled work ethic. When we have plans, I can never be late. Never. Anthony is always on time.</p>\n<p>I have tremendous respect Anthony. We are very different in our ways of thinking but have found an almost “Good &amp; Evil” balance in our relationship, even collaborating on a chocolate bar of that name. Whenever he invites me on his show, it doesn’t take long before we just ignore the cameras and have the same fun we always do. He still continues to find new ways to pull me out of my comfort zone, whether with alcohol indigenous to a town I’ve never heard of in a country I’ve never been, or noodles laced with spices so hot it takes me days to recover. Despite his time away traveling, despite our differences, despite being often mistaken for him on the street, it is a very genuine friendship that I am very grateful to have.</p>\n","img":"KitchenConf.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>Your body is not a temple, it's an amusement park.

They summited Everest with four other teammates, just as a freak and ferocious storm covered the mountain.  By the time Krakauer made it back to base camp several hours later, four of his climbing partners would be dead.  In total, eight lives (including Hall’s) were lost on that fateful expedition – at the time, the single biggest disaster in Everest history.  Krakauer’s account of this searing experience is raw and immediate.  It’s both a terrible tragedy and page-turning adventure story.  Worth reading on a cold snowy night this winter.</p>\n","img":"IntoThinAir.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>Attempting to climb Everest is an intrinsically irrational act – a triumph of desire over sensibility.</p>\n","featured":0,"exclusive":0,"position":1,"visible":true,"judge_id":1,"store_id":1,"in_stock":true,"price":9.99,"swag":false,"is_shipping":0,"msrp":null,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":0,"authors":[169]},"191":{"id":191,"mmid":1412699,"title":"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","month":10,"year":1,"pages":null,"description_title":null,"description":"<p>Poor Oscar Wao.  He will never outgrow his nerdy phase, but it’s a distinct pleasure to trace his life and the life of his extended family up until its premature end. Oscar, a Dominican kid in New Jersey who loves sci-fi and fantasizing about falling in love, is the victim of a fukú (or curse) that has affected his family for generations. Oscar’s family’s story is narrated by Yunior, the type of ultra-masculine man who is Oscar’s diametric opposite. In his own unique voice, Yunior weaves together Oscar’s mother’s history as an orphan in the Dominican Republic, Oscar’s sister’s struggles in Patterson, and Oscar’s own experiences with bullies, awkwardness, and unrequited love.</p>\n<p>Incorporating the most exciting aspects from a variety of literary genres, <em>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</em> is a novel that plumbs psychological depths, revels in the magical mysteries of one’s ancestry, and always does so with plenty of laughs. This perfect mix makes Junot Díaz’s masterpiece one of the most important (and fun!) reads of the 21st century so far.</p>\n","img":"OscarWao-1.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>Dude wore his nerdiness like a Jedi wore his light saber or a Lensman her lens.
