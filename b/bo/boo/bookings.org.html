      <p>Preferences: data about personal preferences regarding hotel stay. 
	When you choose to receive personalised information and special offers 
	BOOKINGS will ask you for your personal preferences regarding hotel stay. 
      </p>
      <p>Credit card details: credit card number, expiry date, credit card organisation 
	and name stated on the credit card. </p>

      <p><a name="2"></a><b>Why is this data collected? </b><br>
        Your contact data is used by BOOKINGS to make the reservation in the hotel. 
	This data will be passed on to the hotel. The hotel uses your contact information to 
	make the reservation, to identify you upon arrival and to contact you in case of 
	changes to the reservation. This data can also be used by BOOKINGS to communicate with 
	you.</p>
      <p>Your booking data tells BOOKINGS what kind of room you have booked and will be sent 
	to the hotel. Statistical booking data (for example the percentage of customers 
	booking a two star hotel) is used to modify and enhance the product and services 
	offered on the BOOKINGS website. </p>
      <p>Your preferences will be used by BOOKINGS to provide you with tailor-made information 
	and special offers. BOOKINGS only asks you for your preferences if you choose to receive 
	information and special offers. BOOKINGS will only send you information and special 
	offers if you want us to do so. When you register to receive personalised information 
	and special offers you can, at all times, ask BOOKINGS to stop sending you information 
	and special offers. From that moment on, your preferences will be kept at BOOKINGS 
	anonymously without any connection to your personal data.</p>
	<p>Your internet data will be used to make general statistics about the use of the 
	internet, for example: what type of internet browser is most widely used. These 
	statistics will be used to see if it is possible to make any improvements to the 
	BOOKINGS website. These statistics can never be traced back to you as an individual.

	<p><a name="9"></a><b>Credit Card Information.</b><br>
      	The majority of hotels require your credit card details in order to guarantee  your 
	reservation. When you send your credit card information to BOOKINGS, it will be passed 
	on to the hotel in which you want to make a booking. When you make a booking at the 
	BOOKINGS website you automatically enter into an agreement with the hotel you have 
	chosen. This agreement also implies that you adhere to the hotel's cancellation policy. </p>
      <p>Please follow cancellation procedures stated in the confirmation e-mail. You may 
	expect to be charged a cancellation fee set forth by the hotel individually. It is 
	international standard hotel practice to charge the equivalent of one night's stay 
	for late cancellations or no-shows. <br>
	BOOKINGS never withdraws any money from your credit card. BOOKINGS only acts as an 
	intermediary between yourself and the hotel. </p>
      <p>The majority of hotels do not withdraw money from your credit card at the time of the 
	reservation. You will pay your hotel bill at the hotel, either on arrival or after your stay. 
	A small number of hotels charge one room night to your credit card right after you have made a 
	reservation. If this is the case, this will be clearly stated on the hotel page.</p>
      <p>Your credit card details will be kept at BOOKINGS until your arrival date at the hotel. 
	After this date the details will be destroyed. You have the option of communicating your 
	credit card information directly to the hotel via phone or fax, and not via BOOKINGS. 
	You must do so within 24 hours after you have made your reservation. BOOKINGS strongly 
	urges you not to send your credit card information by e-mail, since this is the most 
	unsafe way to send your credit card details over the internet.

	<p><a name="3"></a><b>Control over your data. </b> <br>
        You have, at all times, the right to view the personal data that is stored about you. 
	You can request your personal data by emailing BOOKINGS at the following 
	address: privacy@bookings.org. Please state 'request personal data' in the subject 
	line of your e-mail. 
      </p>
      <p>If your personal data has been stated incorrectly by BOOKINGS, BOOKINGS will change it 
	upon your request. You can also ask BOOKINGS to remove your personal data from its 
	database by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address mentioned directly above. Please 
	state 'removal from the database' in the subject line of your e-mail. Your request will 
	be answered and complied with within four weeks.

	<p><a name="4"></a><b>Your data and third parties. </b><br>
        BOOKINGS  will not supply your personal information to any unrelated external third 
	party for any unsolicited or commercial purpose, nor does it have any intention to do 
	so in the future.  </p>
      <p>Statistical information, which can not be linked to you as an individual, may be 
	shared with companies or organisations that compile general statistics about the use 
	of the internet. </p>
      <p>BOOKINGS works closely together with several highly valued partners. Some of these 
	partners have their own website which offers a product or a service. As an extra service 
	on these websites there is the possibility to make a hotel reservation using the 
	BOOKINGS system. An example of this is http://www.holland.com. In some cases BOOKINGS 
	may agree to share your contact and booking data with these partners. This concerns only 
	reservations made via the website of the partner and only on strict conditions concerning
	the protection of your personal information comparable to the provisions of this privacy 
	statement, as agreed upon by BOOKINGS and the partner. </p>
      <p>BOOKINGS is not responsible for the behaviour of its partners concerning your personal 
	information. BOOKINGS recommends that you carefully read the privacy policy of a partner 
	before making a hotel reservation.  BOOKINGS requested its partners, and in some cases 
	laid down in contracts, that third parties are required to take into consideration the 
	BOOKINGS privacy policy when dealing with your personal information.</p>
      <p>BOOKINGS may be required by law to disclose your personal data, which you made 
	known when using our service, to the authorities.

	<p><a name="5"></a><b>When does BOOKINGS send you e-mail messages?</b><br>
        After you have made a booking you will receive a confirmation message with all the 
	information about your booking. You may take this confirmation to the hotel as proof of 
	the reservation.</p>
      <p>Sometimes BOOKINGS sends feedback e-mails after your stay at the hotel. These feedback 
	e-mails give you the opportunity to state your opinion about the BOOKINGS' hotels. If 
	you are not interested in giving your opinion, you can state this and we will not send 
	you any more e-mails on future bookings. </p>
      <p>On the BOOKINGS website and on the booking form you can register to receive a general 
	newsletter containing special offers and information about BOOKINGS. You can at all 
	times choose to stop receiving these newsletters. Every e-mail newsletter contains a 
	link, which you can use to remove yourself from the mailing list (not yet available).</p>
      <p>Besides our newsletter you can also choose to receive personalised hotel offers by 
	e-mail message. These offers are generated based on your hotel preferences. You can at 
	all times stop receiving these e-mail messages by clicking the link at the bottom of the 
	e-mail (not yet available).</p>
      <p>BOOKINGS will keep you informed by e-mail of any changes in functionality and 
	appearance to the BOOKINGS website.
