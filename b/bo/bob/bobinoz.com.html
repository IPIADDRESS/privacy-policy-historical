WEB SITE PRIVACY POLICY</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Web Products PTY Ltd,  (referred to in this document as "COMPANY" or "We"), is concerned  that its reputation, and the responsibilities that come with using  it, always remain of paramount importance in all of Web Products PTY Ltd's  activities. To that end, in addition to certain conditions and  restrictions that you will find under the Terms of Use Agreement  [insert hyperlink here] and our Legal Disclaimer [insert hyperlink  here] on our Internet Web Site, the information and links to other  web sites provided below explain Web Products PTY Ltd's policy about privacy,  options you can use to limit the use of information about you both  here and elsewhere on the internet, valuable information about the  internet generally, public policy issues about the internet and  internet privacy as well as other information about rights and  responsibilities concerning privacy in a variety of non-internet  areas.<br>
<br>
We believe your business is no one else's. Your privacy is important  to you and to us. So we'll protect the information you share with  us. To protect your privacy, Web Products PTY Ltd follows standard principles  in accordance with worldwide practices for Customer/Member privacy  and data protection.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b><br>
Web Products PTY Ltd's policy is to respect the privacy of all of our  visitors, so the following policy statement tells you about what  information we may receive, send or ask of you, what its used for  and ways you can control its use.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Generally, anyone can  come to visit BobinOz.com, and Web Products PTY Ltd will not keep information  about these visits except for a record of how many total visits have  been made to the Web Site and its various web pages altogether (not  how many times any single person has visited). <br>
<br>
However, if you become a Customer/Member (see our Terms of Use  Agreement [insert hyperlink here] for a detailed explanation), which  requires giving identifying information to Web Products PTY Ltd (together  referred to in this document as a "Customer/Member "), Membership  records will be started according to information you give us or that  we receive from or send to your computer. <br>
<br>
<b>SECURITY</b><br>
<br>
Web Products PTY Ltd has taken strong measures to protect the security of  your personal information and to ensure that your choices for its  intended use are honoured. We take strong precautions to protect  your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure,  alteration, or destruction. Your Personal Information is stored on  secure servers that are not accessible by third parties. We provide  you with the capability to transmit you Personal Information via  secured and encrypted channels if you use a similarly equipped web  browser.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">These security  measures are in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of  the information that we obtain from you, but we make no assurances  about our ability to prevent any such loss, misuse, to you or to any  third party arising out of any such loss, misuse, or alteration. <br>
<br>
In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must  notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting  rules and procedures.<br>
Web Products PTY Ltd strictly protects the security of your personal  information and honours your choices for its intended use. We  carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access  or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Your personal  information is never shared outside the company without your  permission, except under conditions explained above. Inside the  company, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited  access. Your information may be stored and processed in the USA or  any other country where Web Products PTY Ltd, its subsidiaries, affiliates or  agents are located.<br>
<br>
You also have a significant role in protecting your information. No  one can share these see or edit your personal information without  knowing your user name and password, so do not with others.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN AND TO PARENTS</b><br>
We adhere to the Children's Privacy Act. You must be 18 years of age  to join or use BobinOz.com or any of the recommended or linked sites.  This site follows the guidelines, policies and laws of the Federal  Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov). We retain the right to refuse anyone  membership in any of our sites. If we learn or have reason to  believe that a User is underage according to the guidelines,  policies and laws of the Federal Trade Commission, we will promptly  revoke that User's account and delete any personal information.<br>
<br>
<b>ENFORCEMENT<br>
</b>If for some reason you believe Web Products PTY Ltd has not adhered to  these principles, please notify us at: bob@bobinoz.com or by  certified mail, return receipt requested, to PO Box 1042, Kenmore, QLD, 4069 Australia. We  will do our best to determine and correct the problem promptly. Be  certain the words Privacy Policy are in the Subject line.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>ELECTRONIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION</b><br>
When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register  your purchase electronically. When you do, we merge your  registration information with any information you've already left  with us (we call that information your personal profile). If you  haven't previously registered with us, we create a personal profile  for you from your product registration information. If you ever want  to review or update that information, you can click on Update  Profile, and edit any of the Personal Information in your profile.  If you haven't already created a membership, we will ask you to do  so. This ensures that only you can access your information.<br>
<br>
<b>CUSTOMER OR MEMBERSHIP PROFILES</b><br>
As mentioned above, every registered customer or member has a unique  personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal  identification username, which helps us ensure that only you can  access your profile.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">When you register,  you create your profile, your username and password. It is your  passport to seamless travel across your member area, allowing you to  download software and order more plug-in modules without having to  fill out registration forms with information you've already  provided. Even if you switch computers, you won't have to  re-register - just use your Registration ID to identify yourself.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>WHAT WE DO WITH  THE INFORMATION YOU SHARE</b><br>
When you join us, you provide us with your contact information,  including your name and email address. We use this information to  send you updates about your order, questionnaires to measure your  satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and  exciting services that we offer. When you order from us, our 3rd  party payment processors such as PayPal and 2checkout.com will ask  for your credit card number and billing address. They use this  information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that  time.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">We occasionally hire  other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including  programming, answering Customer/Member questions about products or  services, sending email and processing event registration. We will  only provide those companies the information they need to deliver  the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for  any other purpose.<br>
<br>
<b>CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, Web Products PTY Ltd  will not share your personal information with any third parties  without your consent.<br>
Web Products PTY Ltd will disclose your personal information, without notice,  only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that  such action is necessary to:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">i. Conform to the  edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Web Products PTY Ltd  or the site; <br>
<br>
ii. Protect and defend the rights or property of Web Products PTY Ltd and its  family of Websites; <br>
<br>
iii. Enforce our Terms of Use Agreement [insert hyperlink here]; or <br>
<br>
iv. Act under exigent circumstances to protect the safety of the  public or users of the Site.<br>
<br>
If your information is lost or stolen, you must promptly notify us  if your credit card, user name, or password is lost, stolen, or used  without permission. In such an event, we will remove that credit  card number, user name, or password from your account and update our  records accordingly.<br>
<br>
The Site contains links to other websites. We are not responsible  for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. We also  make email services, bulletin board services, chat areas, news  groups, forums, communities, personal web pages, calendars, photo  albums, file cabinets and/or other message or communication  facilities designed to enable User to communicate with others (each  a "Communication Service" and collectively "Communication Services")  available to you. Please understand that any information that is  disclosed in these areas becomes public information. We have no  control over its use and you should exercise caution when deciding  to disclose your Personal Information.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>PERSONAL  INFORMATION-WHY AND HOW "IP ADDRESSES" ARE USED</b> <br>
An IP address is a basic element of the way the Internet functions.  It is a number that identifies your computer according to its IP  address, and IP numbers are assigned to web sites automatically. IP  addresses may also be identified in "header" information on emails.  There may also be other services and occasions when IP addresses  will appear. Always look carefully at what information may be  displayed about you, including your IP address, and if you are  unsure or uncomfortable about the appearance of your IP address, do  not use that service. <br>
<br>
In addition to being an important part of how computers communicate  with each other correctly, IP addresses can be used for other  things, as well. In Web Products PTY Ltd's case, IP addresses are collected  for smooth operation in administrating our Web Site system, for  purposes of collecting the non-personal "grouping" information for  use by Web Products PTY Ltd and certain third parties, as discussed above,  and to generally monitor the use of BobinOz.com. IP addresses are  exchanged many times when you are surfing the web, so, for example,  if you select a web page or link within Web Products PTY Ltd, the IP address  is recorded by the server by which Web Products PTY Ltd's Web Site is  connected to the internet.<br>
<br>
For most purposes, your IP address will not be connected with  personally identifying information, only the fact of that access to  a given place on our web sites gets noted, but who you are  individually will be anonymous, even to Web Products PTY Ltd.&nbsp; However,  as with certain information discussed in other parts of this  document, IP Address information will be used to help us identify a  person if Web Products PTY Ltd, in good faith, believes it important for  ensuring proper compliance with our rules and policies, if it  appears to be necessary to comply with laws and to protect  Web Products PTY Ltd, our members and customers or other third parties.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>PERSONAL  INFORMATION-OPTING OUT</b> <br>
Web Products PTY Ltd, our affiliates or selected third parties may use  personal information you give Web Products PTY Ltd for marketing and  promotions. You do not have to let us use this information in that  manner. This is called "opting out," and it means you can tell us  not to use your personal information for these purposes:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">i. Listing you in any  Customer/Member directory, <br>
ii. Receiving information from us about Web Products PTY Ltd and our services  and products, or<br>
iii. Receiving information from third parties selected by us  because, for example, your interests seem to match services or  products they offer. To opt out, contact bob@bobinoz.com, modify  your personal information or cancel your Membership.<br>
<br>
In addition, there may be specific opt-out processes available when  you enter certain areas of our Web Site, join groups, use services  or when other merchandise is offered. When you see such opt-out  notices, read them for information on how to opt out at that time.  Also, some promotions may ask if you'd like additional information.  Choosing to ask for additional information may require transfer of  your email address, but if more personal information than that is  required, you will be notified prior to such information being  transmitted and may opt out by cancelling the request at that time.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>OTHER IMPORTANT  COMPANY PRIVACY ISSUES</b><br>
A "Cookie" is a small file sent to and stored in your computer to  keep accurate records and customize certain services. In fact, it's  become so common that you can almost always expect cookies to be  sent to your computer from a wide variety of Internet sites.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">For Web Products PTY Ltd,  cookies are designed to try to make your visits more personal and  helpful according to the ways you use our Web Sites. They tell us  the name that a Customer/Member uses at Web Products PTY Ltd and can tailor  things like greetings, e-cards and so-forth to make your use of  Web Products PTY Ltd feel like you're right at home. They can also tell us,  for example, that you focus on particular types of information you  need as a Customer/Member, and the cookie may automatically see to  it that when you log in you get a message about some new feature in  your areas of interest or about other services that fit the way you  use Web Products PTY Ltd. Also, sometimes when messages are sent to certain  Web Products PTY Ltd destinations, like "customer service," a cookie may be  used to help process your message more efficiently and accurately.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">However, cookies at  Web Products PTY Ltd are never used for storing or accessing important  personal information that you alone should control the use of-like  your password or your credit card number.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Even though cookies  are usually thought to be helpful to web sites and their users  alike, not everybody wants them being put in their computer. That's  okay, but there are two things you need to know: if you don't have  cookies, not everything on your Web Products PTY Ltd visits may be  accessible, as efficient or as personable; and, stopping cookies is  something we can't do, instead you have to do it in your own  computer.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Stopping cookies  shouldn't be difficult; however, because cookies are so commonly  used and welcomed today, most browsers are set to automatically  accept them. Even so, if you look through the settings in your  browser, often in "preferences," "setup" or "configuration," you  should be able to find a place where you can change the cookies  setting, either to tell your browser never to accept cookies, or to  tell your browser to notify you if a cookie is about to be sent and  give you a chance to accept it or not. In the latter case, you  should know that cookies are often just numbered or use some kind of  computer term that will not be helpful for you to identify what the  cookie is actually for so that you can make a clear choice, but the  option is yours. <br>
<br>
<b>SPECIAL CONCERNS ABOUT HYPERLINKS</b><br>
In this document, there are buttons or underlined words and phrases  that you can click on. You will find these all over our Web Site and  nearly every other web site you visit throughout the Internet, too.  Some of them link to other parts of the same web site, but others  will send you to another site unrelated to the web site you were at.  This kind of link is called a hyperlink and could send you to a web  page a block away or on the other side of the world.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">When we use  hyperlinks at Web Products PTY Ltd, we try to make sure they are updated and  accurate links and that they are compatible with the kinds of  visitors we have. However, Web Products PTY Ltd has no control over the  business, operations or representations of these hyperlinks to  unrelated web sites-and any hyperlinks included on them-and what the  destination web pages may contain. Web Products PTY Ltd's Privacy Policy does  not cover other such destinations. You should always be careful at  other web sites about how they operate and how information is being  used. They may have their own policies that differ from  Web Products PTY Ltd's, they may send different kinds of cookies and they may  gather and use information in very different ways than Web Products PTY Ltd.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">We can take no  responsibility or protect you on other web sites, so always be  careful-not just about things like opting out on advertising, but  also about safety and security. Once again, carefully protect  personal information about yourself, and be wary of who might get  such information, especially the public through chat-rooms, bulletin  boards or by email. Not being careful about this can be risky, and  because Web Products PTY Ltd can't control these hyperlinked sites or users,  and because our own policies and rules don't apply, the risk is on  you to decide how, and how not, to use them.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>DO YOU ACCEPT OUR  PRIVACY POLICY? </b><br>
By using this Web Site, you are verifying that you agree to, and  will abide by, the terms of the Web Products PTY Ltd Privacy Policy.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">IF YOU DO NOT AGREE  TO DO SO, STOP VISITING OUR WEB SITES.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Second, check our  privacy policy every once in a while. Certain things may change over  time, and we may include new information and privacy policies that  will be placed in this document. If you continue to visit  Web Products PTY Ltd after any such changes, you will again be verifying that  you agree to, and will abide by, the current privacy policy, as it  then exists.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>UPDATES AND  CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY</b> <br>
We reserve the right, at any time and without notice, to add to,  change, update, or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting  such change, update, or modification on the Site and without any  other notice to you. Any such change, update, or modification will  be effective immediately upon posting on the Site.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>QUESTIONS &amp;  COMMENTS?</b> <br>
Web Products PTY Ltd is always ready to review your questions and comments  and we will attempt to give you our best responses. Remember, we  have a lot of Customer/Member s and other visitors to respond to, as  well, but we will try to reply as promptly and thoroughly as  possible. To contact Web Products PTY Ltd about our privacy policy, send an  email to bob@bobinoz.com.</font></p></td></tr>
