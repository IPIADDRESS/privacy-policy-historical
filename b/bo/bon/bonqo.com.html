<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Bonqo.com website ("Site") and any related services ("Services").  The Site and Services are owned and operated by ELLA Internet Technologies Inc. ("ELLA").  By using the Site or Services, you agree to these Terms.</p>
<h2>1.0 Eligibility</h2>

<h2>2.0	Use of the Site and Services</h2>
<p>You are responsible for your use of the Site and Services, and for any use of the Site or Services made using your account.  At ELLA, our goal is to create a positive and safe community experience.  To promote this goal, we prohibit certain kinds of conduct that may be harmful to other users or to ELLA.  When you use the Site or Services, you may not:</p>
<ul>
<li>violate any law or regulation;</li>
<li>violate or infringe other people's intellectual property, privacy, publicity, or other legal rights;</li>

<li>use any means to "scrape," "crawl," or "spider" any Web pages contained in the Site (although ELLA does allow operators of public search engines to use spiders to index materials from the Site for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials, and ELLA reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases);</li>
<li>use automated methods to use the Site or Services in a manner that sends more requests to the ELLA servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional Web browser; or</li>
<li>interfere with or disrupt the Site or Services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.0	Interactions with Third Parties through the Site or Services</h2>
<p>Your interactions with third parties found on or through the Site or Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, representations or warranties associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such third parties.  You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any third parties.  You agree that ELLA shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.  ELLA is not a party to any transaction between you and any third party and has no obligation to monitor or enforce any transactions.  If there is a dispute between you and a third party relating to the Site or Services, you understand and agree that ELLA is under no obligation to become involved and you hereby release ELLA, its officers, employees, agents and successors in rights from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or the Site or Services.</p>
<h2>4.0	Premium and Business Users</h2>
<p>Using the Site and Services is generally free.  We may charge fees for certain Services, including, for example, premium or business user subscriptions.  If the Services you use charges a fee, you will be able to review and accept the fees before the Services begin.  All fees are non-refundable even if the Services are suspended or canceled prior to the end of the applicable subscription term.  About thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date of your Services, ELLA will notify you by using your e-mail address on file that your account is ready to be renewed.</p>
<h2>5.0	User Content</h2>
<p>You own all content and information you post or share using the Site or Services (referred to as "User Content"), such as posting or sharing classified advertisements, reviews, photos, profile information, and audio and video clips.  You give ELLA permission to use your User Content as follows:  you grant to ELLA and its affiliates a license to use, copy, display and perform your User Content in connection with the Site or Services.  We may display advertisements in connection with your User Content or on pages where your User Content may be viewed by you or others and we may use your User Content to advertise and promote ELLA, the Site or the Services.  Our license to your User Content is non-exclusive, meaning you may use the User Content for your own purposes or let others use your User Content for their purposes.  Our license to your User Content is fully-paid and royalty free, meaning we do not owe you anything else in connection with our use of your User Content.  We may exercise our rights anywhere in the world.  Finally, our license is perpetual, meaning that our license lasts for an indefinite period of time.</p>
<h2>You promise that:</h2>
<ul>
<li>you own all rights to your User Content or, alternatively, that you have the right to give ELLA the rights described above;</li>
<li>you have paid and will pay in full any fees or other payments that may be related to the use of your User Content; and</li>
<li>your User Content does not infringe the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, publicity rights, or other legal rights of any third party.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may refuse to accept or transmit User Content.  We may remove User Content from the Site or Services for any reason.</p>
<h2>6.0 Ownership</h2>

<h2>8.0	Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>We respect the intellectual property rights of others.  Upon proper notice, we will remove User Content or other applicable content that violates copyright or other intellectual property rights.

<h2>10.0 Links</h2>
<p>Our Site and Services may contain links to other websites, or allow others to send you such links.  A link to a third party's website does not mean that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it.

You should always read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of a third-party website before using it.</p>
<h2>11.0	Changes to the Site or Services</h2>

<h2>13.0	Disclaimer and Limitations on Our Liability</h2>
<p class="uppercase">YOU USE THE SITE AND SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK.  THE SITE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS.  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ELLA AND ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, AND LICENSORS (REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY AS "AFFILIATES") DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE AND SERVICES (INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT).
</p><p>IN PARTICULAR, ELLA AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, SAFETY, OR APPROPRIATENESS OF CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY USER CONTENT), OR THE CONTENT OF ANY WEBSITES OR RESOURCES LINKED TO THE SITE OR SERVICES.  ELLA AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY:  (a) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT; (b) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES; (c) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVERS OR OF ANY PERSONAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION; (d) ANY INTERRUPTION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE SITE OR SERVICES; (e) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE WHICH MAY BE TRANSMITTED ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES BY ANY THIRD PARTY; OR (f) ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, E-MAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES.</p>
<p>ELLA AND ITS AFFILIATES DO NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BY A THIRD PARTY ON OR THROUGH THE ELLA SITE OR SERVICES OR ANY LINKED WEBSITE.</p>
<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY MATERIAL OR INFORMATION DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE ARISING FROM DOING SO.  NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM ELLA OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE IN THESE TERMS.</p>
<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER ELLA NOR ITS AFFILIATES WILL BE LIABLE UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF REVENUES, PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF SUCH PARTIES WERE ADVISED OF, KNEW OF OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages.  Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you.  To the extent ELLA may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of ELLA's liability will be the minimum permitted under such law.</p>
<h2>14.0	Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ELLA and its Affiliates from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, fees of any kind (including reasonable attorneys' fees and legal costs), arising from or relating to: (a) any information (including your User Content, feedback, or any other content) that you or anyone using your account submit, post, or transmit through the Site or Services; (b) the use of the Site or Services by you or anyone using your account; (c) the violation of these Terms by you or anyone using your account; or (d) the violation of any rights of any third party, including intellectual property, privacy, publicity, or other proprietary rights by you or anyone using your account.  ELLA reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you.  If we do assume the defense of such a matter, you will reasonably cooperate with ELLA in such defense.</p>
<h2>15.0	Other Provisions</h2>
<p>Under no circumstances will ELLA be held liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in part to any acts of nature or other causes beyond its reasonable control.  These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any conflict of laws rules or provisions.  You agree that any action of whatever nature arising from or relating to these Terms, the Site, or any Services will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in Santa Barbara, California.  You consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any such action.   If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining provisions.    The failure of ELLA to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not prevent ELLA from enforcing such right or provision in the future.  We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, a sale of assets or by operation of law.</p>
<h2>16.0	Changes to these Terms</h2>
<p>From time to time, we may change these Terms.  If we change these Terms, we will inform you by posting the revised Terms on the Site.  Those changes will go into effect on the Revision Date shown in the revised Terms.  By continuing to use our Site or Services, you agree to the revised Terms.</p>

<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p class="quiet">Revised: May 24, 2010</p>
<h2>1.0	Introduction</h2>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us.  We have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, protect, and disclose information and data when you use the Bonqo.com website ("Site") or any related services ("Services").  The Site and Services are owned and operated by ELLA Internet Technologies Inc. ("ELLA").  This Privacy Policy also explains your choices for managing your information preferences, including opting out of certain uses of your Personal Information.  By using the Site or Services you consent to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>2.0	Managing Your Information Preferences</h2>
<p>You can always review, correct, update, or change your Personal Information, or opt out of our direct marketing efforts, by changing the relevant settings in your Site profile or account (if available), or by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:support@bonqo.com?subject=Personal Information">support@bonqo.com</a>. If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:feedback@bonqo.com">feedback@bonqo.com</a>.</p>
<h2>3.0 Information We Collect</h2>
<h4>3.1	Personal Information.</h4>
<p>We collect information that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, telephone number, username, e-mail, and other personally identifiable information that you choose to provide us with or that you choose to include in any Site profile or account ("Personal Information").  We collect Personal Information only if you choose to share it with us.  You may be asked to provide us with Personal Information when you register with the Site or any of our Services, and at other times.  The decision to provide this information is optional.  However, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Site or Services.</p>
<h4>3.2	Usage Data.</h4>
<p>We automatically collect anonymous usage information that does not identify an individual user ("Usage Data").  For example, each time you use the Site we automatically collect the type of Web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, the pages you view, and the time and duration of your visits to the Site.  We use this information to help us understand how people use the Site and Services, and to enhance the services we offer.</p>
<h4>3.3	Cookies and Web Beacons.</h4>
<p>We use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser).  We also use Web beacons (an electronic file placed on a Website that monitors usage).  We use cookies and Web beacons to improve the quality of the Site and Services.  Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.  You can reset your Web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, certain features of the Site or Services may not work if you delete or disable cookies.  Some of our Service Providers may use their own cookies and Web beacons in connection with the services they perform on our behalf.</p>
<h2>4.0	How We Use Information and When We May Share and Disclose Information.</h2>
<h4>4.1	Generally.</h4>
<p>We use Personal Information for internal purposes only, such as to provide you with the Site and Services, to notify you of new products or Services, and to otherwise communicate with you about our business.  We will not disclose Personal Information to third parties without your consent, except as explained in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4>4.2	Profile Information You Make Available to Others.</h4>
<p>By using the Site or the Services you may make certain of your Personal Information available to others.  For example, when you post a classified advertisement on the Site other users may see your name, the city you live in and other information from your post that you choose to make available to others.  The information you choose to make available, may be accessed by other Site users who conduct searches on the Site and may be accessed by commercial search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Bing to the extent that such engines are permitted to access the Site.</p>
<h4>4.3	Service Providers.</h4>
<p>From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses whom we believe trustworthy and who have confirmed that their privacy practices are consistent with ours ("Service Providers").  For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, data storage and management, and marketing and promotions.  We only provide our Service Providers with the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf.  Each Service Provider must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.  Service Providers are prohibited from using Personal Information other than as specified by us.</p>
<h4>4.4	Ad Networks.</h4>
<p>We may work with third-party marketing and advertising companies ("Ad Networks").  These companies may collect and use information about your use of the Site or Services in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.  Advertisements may be shown via the Site, the Services, or third-party websites.  These companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as Web beacons.  Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an Ad Network may collect from you.  It also does not cover any information that you may choose to provide to an Ad Network or to an advertiser whose goods or services are advertised through the Site or Services.  For more information about ad cookies, and to "opt-out" of the collection of information by some companies that allow you to do so, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>.</p>
<h4>4.5	Standard Analytics Information.</h4>
<p>We may use, and disclose to third parties, certain Usage Data regarding the Site and Services.  However, in such cases, your Usage Data is aggregated with the Usage Data of other users and does not identify you individually.</p>
<h4>4.6	Other Transfers.</h4>
<p>We may share Personal Information and Usage Data with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with ELLA.  If ELLA is merged, acquired, or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information and Usage Data in connection with such transactions.  You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if, in our discretion, the new entity plans to handle your information in a way that differs materially from this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4>4.7	Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</h4>
<p>ELLA cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.  We may disclose Personal Information and any other information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in our discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate in order to respond to legal requests (including court orders and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property or rights of ELLA or of any third party, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.</p>
<h2>5.0	Be Careful When You Share Information with Others.</h2>
<p>Please be aware that whenever you share information on a publicly available profile page or any other public forum on the Site, that information may be accessed by others.  In addition, when you share information in any other communications with third parties, that information may be passed along or made public by others.  This means that anyone with access to such information can potentially use it for any purpose, including sending unsolicited communications.</p>
<h2>6.0	Security</h2>
<p>We recognize the importance of safeguarding the confidentiality of your Personal Information.  Accordingly, we employ reasonable measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.  However, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through the Site or Services, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the Site or Services, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<h2>7.0	Links To Other Websites</h2>
<p>Our Site and Services may contain links to other websites, or allow others to send you such links.  A link to a third party's website does not mean that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it.  We do not exercise control over third-party websites.  You access such third-party websites or content at your own risk.  You should always read the privacy policy of a third-party website before providing any information to the website.</p>
<h2>8.0	Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13.  If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.  In addition, we recommend that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>
<h2>9.0	Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>From time to time, we may change this Privacy Policy.  If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will inform you by posting the revised Privacy Policy on the Site.  Those changes will go into effect on the Revision Date shown in the revised Privacy Policy.  Your continued use of our Site or Services constitutes your consent to the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
