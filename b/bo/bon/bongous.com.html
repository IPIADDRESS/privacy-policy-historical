            <li><strong>Protecting the vital interests of individuals.</strong> This includes processing data when necessary to protect the vital interests of an individual (e.g., for urgent medical reasons).</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance with legal obligations.</strong> This addresses the processing of Personal Data as necessary for compliance with laws, regulations and sector specific guidelines to which FedEx is subject (e.g., matching names of clients, suppliers and business partners against denied partiesâ€™ lists).</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Who has access to your Personal Data?</strong></li>
        <p>FedEx may share your Personal Data with third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
    
            <ul>
            <li>FedEx may share your Personal Data with its affiliates, operating groups, subsidiaries and divisions, or with third parties if such is necessary for the purposes as listed above. If appropriate, FedEx will require third parties to conduct activities in a manner consistent with FedEx policies and guidelines in relation to data protection.</li> 
            <li>FedEx may share your Personal Data with data processors, i.e. parties processing Personal Data on our behalf, such as our payment card processors that support our check out functions by processing all payment card transactions on our behalf.

            </ul>
        <p><strong>Retailers and Other Third Parties.</strong> We work closely with online merchants who use our Sites to provide their international shopping cart functionality. If you arrived at one of our Sites through a third party retailer or other FedEx Cross Border client or affiliate (the "Retailer"), we share the Personal Information we collect from you with the Retailer. You do not need to register with us to use the services we provide to Retailers. In addition, as described in our Digital Platform Privacy Notice, the Retailer may also set a cookie and collect information from you. And we may retain your Personal Information to resolve disputes, comply with legally mandated reporting, disclosure, or other legal process requirements. The Retailers are located in the United States or other countries that may not be considered adequate by data protection authorities in your home country. Before proceeding with your transaction, read the Retailer's Privacy Policy to understand how it may collect, process or disclose your Personal Information. This Privacy Notice does not apply to Retailer websites accessible through our Sites.</p>

<li><strong>How long will FedEx process your Personal Data?</strong></li>

    <p>FedEx retains your Personal Data for a limited amount of time and will delete your Personal Data after it is no longer necessary for the purposes of the processing. The exact period of time is based on the type of the Personal Data and the legal obligations or business purposes for retaining it.</p>

<li><strong>What measures does FedEx take to protect your Personal Data?</strong></li>
    <p>FedEx has taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your Personal Data against accidental or unlawful processing, including by ensuring that:</p> 

        <ul>
        <li>your Personal Data is protected against unauthorized access;</li>
        <li>the confidentiality of your Personal Data is assured;</li>
        <li>the integrity and availability of your Personal Data will be maintained;</li>
        <li>personnel is trained in information security requirements; and</li>
        <li>actual or suspected data breaches are reported in accordance with applicable law.</li>
        </ul>


<li><strong>Where does FedEx store or transfer your Personal Data?</strong></li>
<p>Due to the nature of our business and the services we provide to our clients, FedEx may need to transfer your Personal Data to locations outside the country where you reside. In any case where we transfer Personal Data, FedEx shall ensure that such a transfer is subject to appropriate safeguards. </p>
<p>For the European Union, such transfers to third parties will be governed by a transfer mechanism approved by the European Commission or national data protection authorities, including model contractual clauses. For more detailed information about these safeguards, please contact <a href="mailto:dataprivacy@fedex.com">dataprivacy@fedex.com</a> or <a href="mailto:crossborder_privacy@ftn.fedex.com"> crossborder_privacy@ftn.fedex.com</a>.</p>

<li><strong>What rights can you exercise in relation to your Personal Data?</strong></li>

Note that in many cases, your rights are not absolute and we may not be required to comply with your request.  A number of such rights, as may be applicable in the European Union, are explained below. </p>

        <p><i>Right of access</i></p> 
        <p>You are entitled to a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to learn details about how we use it. Your Personal Data will usually be provided to you digitally.
        </p>
        
        <p><i>Right to rectification</i></p>
        <p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that the information we hold about you is accurate and complete. However, if you believe this is not the case, you can ask us to update or amend it.
        </p>
        
        <p><i>Right to erasure</i></p>
        <p>In certain circumstances, you have the right to ask us to erase your Personal Data;   for example, where the Personal Data we collected is no longer necessary for the original purpose, where Personal Data has become obsolete or where you withdraw your consent. However, we will need to balance this against other factors. For example, we may not be able comply with your request due to certain legal or regulatory obligations.
        </p>
        
        <p><i>Right to restriction of processing</i></p>
        <p>In certain circumstances, you are entitled to ask us to (temporarily) stop using your Personal Data.  For example, where you think that the Personal Data we hold about you may be inaccurate or where you think that we no longer need to use your Personal Data.  
        </p>
        
        <p><i>Right to object</i></p>
        <p>You have the right to object to processing based on our legitimate interests. Unless we have a compelling legitimate ground for the processing, we will no longer process Personal Data on that basis when you file an objection. Note, however, that we may not be able to provide certain services or benefits if we are unable to process the necessary Personal Data for that purpose.
        </p>
        
        <p><i>Rights relating to automated decision-making</i></p><p>
        </p><p>You have the right not to be subjected to automated decision-making, including profiling, which produces legal effect for you or has a similar significant effect. If you have been subject to an automated decision and do not agree with the outcome, you can contact us using the details below and ask us to review the decision. 
        </p>
        
        <p><i>Right to withdraw consent</i></p>
        <p>We may ask for your consent to process your Personal Data in specific cases.  You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. FedEx will stop the further processing as soon as possible after the withdrawal of your consent. However, this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing before consent was withdrawn.  
        </p>
        
        <p>Please use the contact details above if you would like to exercise any of your rights.</p>
