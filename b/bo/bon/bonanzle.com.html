Bonanzle collects information from you when you register and conduct certain activities on the Site. We collect your full name, valid telephone number, contact/billing information, email address, and shipping address. Most of this information is collected only when you decide to become a seller on the site. Each Member must create a unique user id and password. We also provide you the opportunity to create a profile on the Site, which, depending on your preferences can be public or private. Please note that any information you select to provide in your public profile or via other public areas of the Site can be viewed and used by other members of these forums to send you unsolicited messages. Bonanzle is not responsible for the personal information users� elect to disclose in public forums and we encourage you to use discretion. </p>
<p>When you elect to email a friend about the Site, we request their email address to fulfill your request. We use this third party personal information to send this one time email and for no other purposes. In the event that you select to import your contacts, we shall not store your password but shall access your information specifically for the purpose of updating your address book � we do not use the third party personal information of your contacts that you store in your account for any promotional purposes, or any purpose not explicitly requested by you.</p>
<p>We post testimonials on the Site. These testimonials include users� names. We obtain users� permission prior to posting testimonials on the Site. We are not responsible for the personal information a user elects to share within their testimonial.</p>
<p>We collect some information from your browser. This includes your IP address and the name of the page you requested. This information helps us to diagnose problems with our servers and administer the Site. Basically, your IP address helps us in identifying you and your specific needs.</p>
<p>We also collect information from cookies, which are software tags that are stored by a browser onto your hard drive. These bits of information are general in nature and they allow us to customize our Site to fit your specific preferences. Cookies also allow you to log onto or navigate through specific sections of our Site without having to re-enter certain information. You can decline the use of cookies, if any, through your browser. We tie cookie information to users� to user accounts in order to track users who set up duplicate accounts.  However, we don't make this information publicly visible/available in any way. On occasion we may also employ Web Beacons and clear Gifs on the Site to track information and traffic on the Site. A Web Beacon is a small 1x1 image that allows a Site to monitor site traffic.</p>
<p>Third Party Cookies: We may from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to our Site to help us administer our Site and improve its quality.

<h2>How is my information used?</h2>
<p>The information collected from Bonanzle Members is used to improve product offerings, customize our Site's content and layout, and for marketing and statistical effort.

To change access or modify any of your personal information can be accomplished by logging into your account on the Site as well. We do reserve the right to send users� service and notification emails, which are considered a part of your account; given that these messages are not promotional in nature, you generally cannot opt-out of them without deleting your account.</p>

<h2>Who will see my personal information?</h2>
<p>Our number one priority is to keep your personal information private and confidential. We will not willfully disclose your personal information to third parties.

<ul>
	<li>Other visitors to our Site may view your user ID, rating, city, profile (which includes multiple fields you may elect to fill out or leave blank), and other items you have for sale;</li>
	<li>In order to complete the transaction, the buyer and seller are provided with each others email and postal address;</li>
	<li>When making an offer, the seller can view your user ID, rating and your city.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, once you provide personal information to a buyer or seller on our Site, Bonanzle has no control over how that information is used by that individual.

<ul>
<li>You consent to share the information;</li>
<li>To law enforcement where a formal request has been made such as in responding to subpoenas, court orders or legal process;</li>
<li>Your actions on our Site are, or appear to be, in violation of the Terms of Service and disclosure of this information will assist in efforts to enforce the Terms of Service;</li>
<li>You post a listing, which Bonanzle believes in its sole discretion, may create liability for Bonanzle and disclosure of this personal information may minimize or eliminate its liability.</li>
<li>To our service providers � we employ the services of a third party payment processor on the Site to fulfill payment when a purchase is executed. This third party isn�t authorized to utilize your personal information for any other purposes. We also employ the services of a third party shipping agent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing in this Policy shall limit, prohibit, or otherwise deny the ability of Bonanzle to (1) transfer, assign, or sell its assets, including, without limitation, the assets of our Site, to a third party or (2) dispose of its assets in any manner through bankruptcy or similar proceeding. Bonanzle also makes no representations regarding, and disclaims all liability arising out of, or related to, the accuracy or completeness of the information it collects and discloses through our Site. In the event of a business transfer of assets, which could include your personal information, we shall notify you by email or by a notice on the Site of any significant changes to the information practices governing your personal information. </p>

<h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
<p>We go to great lengths to protect all of your information on our Site. In order to help us maintain the security of your personal information, we ask that you do not share your password with anybody.

<p>We employ industry accepted standards in protecting your personal information during your use of the Site and have established physical and electronic safe guards to protect your information. </p>
