We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>

<p>We may also disclose your personal information</p>
<ul>
	<li>as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process</li>

<h2>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>

<p>We may use cookies, for example, to keep track of your preferences and profile information. Cookies are also used to
collect general usage and volume statistical information that does not include personal information.</p>

<h3>Web beacons</h3>
<p>Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along
with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let
us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer
communications and marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>We use a third party to gather information about how you and others use our Web site. For example, we will know how
many users access a specific page and which links they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and
optimize how our site is used.</p>

<h3>Links to Other Web Sites</h3>
<p>Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of BonusThemes.. If you submit
personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to
carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>When we collect personal information directly from you, we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the
personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over
the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore we cannot guarantee its absolute

another company (e.g. displaying the news, opinions, music, etc). Personal information, such as your email address, may be
collected through the Widget. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly. Information
collected by this Widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.</p>

<p>Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you
provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.</p>
