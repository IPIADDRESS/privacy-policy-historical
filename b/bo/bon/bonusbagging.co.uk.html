Bonus Bagging also collects anonymous  demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP  code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favourites.<br>
  <br>
  There  is also information about your computer hardware and software that is  automatically collected by Bonus Bagging. This information can  include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times  and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by Bonus  Bagging for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the  service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Bonus  Bagging Web site.<br>
  <br>
  Please keep in mind that if you directly  disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive  data through Bonus Bagging public message boards, this information  may be collected and used by others. Note: Bonus Bagging does not  read any of your private online communications.<br>
  <br>
  Bonus Bagging  encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you  choose to link to from Bonus Bagging so that you can understand how  those Web sites collect, use and share your information. Bonus  Bagging is not responsible for the privacy statements or other  content on Web sites outside of the Bonus Bagging and Bonus Bagging  family of Web sites.<br>
  <br>
  Use of your Personal Information<br>
  <br>
  Bonus  Bagging collects and uses your personal information to operate the  Bonus Bagging Web site and deliver the services you have requested.  Bonus Bagging also uses your personally identifiable information to  inform you of other products or services available from Bonus Bagging  and its affiliates. Bonus Bagging may also contact you via surveys to  conduct research about your opinion of current services or of  potential new services that may be offered.<br>
  <br>
  Bonus Bagging does  not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Bonus  Bagging may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external  business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest  to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable  information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not  transferred to the third party. In addition, Bonus Bagging may share  data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis,  send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange  for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your  personal information except to provide these services to Bonus  Bagging, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of  your information.<br>
  <br>
  Bonus Bagging does not use or disclose  sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political  affiliations, without your explicit consent.<br>
  <br>
  Bonus Bagging  keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within  Bonus Bagging, in order to determine what Bonus Bagging services are  the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and  advertising within Bonus Bagging to customers whose behavior  indicates that they are interested in a particular subject  area.<br>
  <br>
  Bonus Bagging Web sites will disclose your personal  information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in  the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform  to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Bonus  Bagging or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of  Bonus Bagging; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect  the personal safety of users of Bonus Bagging, or the public.<br>
  <br>
  Use  of Cookies<br>
  <br>
  The Bonus Bagging Web site use "cookies"  to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text  file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies  cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.  Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web  server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.<br>
  <br>
  One of the  primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to  save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that  you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize  Bonus Bagging pages, or register with Bonus Bagging site or services,  a cookie helps Bonus Bagging to recall your specific information on  subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your  personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses,  and so on. When you return to the same Bonus Bagging Web site, the  information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can  easily use the Bonus Bagging features that you customized.<br>
  <br>
  You  have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers  automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser  setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline  cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive  features of the Bonus Bagging services or Web sites you  visit.<br>
  <br>
  Security of your Personal Information<br>
  <br>
  Bonus  Bagging secures your personal information from unauthorized access,  use or disclosure. Bonus Bagging secures the personally identifiable  information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure  environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.  When personal information (such as a credit card number) is  transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of  encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.<br>
  <br>
  Changes  to this Statement<br>
  <br>
  Bonus Bagging will occasionally update this  Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Bonus  Bagging encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be  informed of how Bonus Bagging is protecting your  information.<br>
