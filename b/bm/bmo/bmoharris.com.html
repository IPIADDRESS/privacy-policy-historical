<p><a id="02" name="02"></a><span class="majorsub">2. Identifying Purpose</span><br>
When you become a BMO Financial Group customer, or apply for additional products and services, we ask you for your personal information
for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>to verify your identity and protect against fraud 
  
</li><li>to understand your financial service requirements 
  
</li><li>to determine suitability of products and services for 
  you 
  
</li><li>to determine your eligibility for certain of our 
  products and services, or those of others, and offer them to you 
  
</li><li>to set up and manage products and services you have 
  requested, and 
  
</li><li>to comply with federal and provincial legal or
regulatory requirements</li>


</ul>
<p>Your personal information may be verified with credit bureau, credit insurers, registries, your employer, personal references and other lenders.</p>

<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

<p><a id="03" name="03"></a><span class="majorsub">3. Obtain Consent</span><br>
When you apply for a new product or service, we ask you for your consent to collect, use or disclose your personal information. You may, at any time, withdraw your consent as long as:</p>
<ul>
<li>you provide reasonable notice 
  
</li><li>we are not legally required to collect, use or 
  disclose your information 
  
</li><li>withdrawing your consent does not impede our ability 
  to fulfill your contract with us 
  
</li><li>it does not relate to a credit product we have granted you where we are required to collect and exchange your personal information on an ongoing basis with credit bureaux, credit insurers and other lenders</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

<p><a id="04" name="04"></a><span class="majorsub">4. Limit Collection</span><br>
We only collect the information we need. We may ask you to provide the following
information:
</p><ul>
<li><b>Social Insurance Number (SIN)</b> for tax reporting purposes as well as other income related government purposes such as when opening an income generating account or a registered retirement investment. We do this in order to comply with the Canada Revenue Agency’s income reporting requirements. We may also collect and use your SIN for administration purposes, such as to ensure an
accurate match between your personal information and your credit bureau information, or as an internal identification
number to accurately identify customers having same or similar names.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Financial Information</b> to ensure that the advice we give is appropriate for you and/or the investments you purchase are suitable for your circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Health Information</b> is required for some of our insurance products to ensure that you are eligible for coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information in some situations. However, if you make this choice, we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or information you request. We may monitor or record our telephone calls with you for our mutual
protection (e.g. to ensure that your instructions are carried out, to document that we have made required disclosures to you, and to ensure that customer service levels are maintained).</p>

<p>We will make certain that you are informed of the purposes listed above when you apply for any of our products or services. If a new purpose for using your personal information develops, we will ask you for your consent.</p>

<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

<p><a id="05" name="05"></a><span class="majorsub">5. Limit Use, Disclosure and Retention</span><br>
BMO Financial Group will only use or disclose your personal information for the reason(s) it was collected. Under no circumstances do we
sell or give lists of our clients to other companies for their own use, and if we obtain client lists from other organizations, we require the organizations to confirm their compliance with all relevant privacy legislation.</p>

<p>To ensure that you benefit from our full range of products and services, we will, with your consent, share your personal information (other than health information) to the extent permitted by law, amongst BMO Financial Group.</p>

<p>Over time, we may buy new businesses or sell some of our businesses. Accordingly, personal information associated with any accounts,
products or services of the business being purchased or sold will be transferred as a business asset to the new business owner.</p>

<p>We may use other companies to provide services to you on our behalf and they will be given only the information needed to perform those services. We have contracts in place holding these companies to the same high standards of confidentiality by which we are governed.</p>

<p>Your information may be transferred across country borders for the purposes of data processing. We may be required to provide
information to a government agency under a lawful order made in that country.</p>

<p>Personal information may be released to legal authorities in cases of suspected money laundering or other criminal activity, for the detection and prevention of fraud, or when required to satisfy the legal or regulatory requirements of federal or provincial governments and/or other regulatory authorities. Other reasons for the release of personal information include when we are legally required to do so (e.g. by court order) or to protect our assets (e.g. collection of overdue accounts). If we release information for any of these reasons,
we keep a record of what, when, why and to whom such information was released.</p>

<p>BMO Financial Group has policies in place that govern the retention of your personal information so it will be kept only for as long as it fulfills its intended purpose or as legally required.</p>

<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>




<p><a id="06" name="06"></a><span class="majorsub">6. Be Accurate</span><br>
We are committed to maintaining the accuracy of your personal information and ensuring that it is complete and up-to-date. If you discover inaccuracies in our data, or your personal information changes, please notify the branch or office where you do business immediately, so that we can make the necessary changes. As well, we will make our best efforts to advise others of any
important amendments to your personal information that we may have released to them. If we do not agree to make the amendments that you
request, you may challenge our decision. Recourse is described in the <a href="#10">Provide Recourse</a> principle.</p>
