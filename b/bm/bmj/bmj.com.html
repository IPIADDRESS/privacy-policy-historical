<h2><font face="Verdana">bmj.com Privacy Policy</font></h2>


<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Protecting your privacy is important to us. Please take a 
few moments to review this Policy.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana"><br>
Introduction</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><em>bmj.com</em> is a website of the BMJ Publishing Group 
Limited, which is a UK based international medical publishing house. bmj.com is 
currently hosted in the US by HighWire Press which is a division of Stanford 
University Libraries (“HighWire").&nbsp; We take privacy issues seriously and are 
committed to protecting your personal information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This privacy policy explains what information has been 
collected about you, how personal information is being used, to whom personal 
information is being disclosed and how this personal information is stored and 
protected. This privacy policy has been developed in accordance with our legal 
obligations and may be updated from time to time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you have any queries concerning your personal 
information or any questions on our use of the information, please contact us 
using the contact us form
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="/cgi/feedback">here</a>.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana"><br>
The information we collect and how we use it:</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">1. What information is being collected and how is it used?<br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
When you visit this site to access <em>bmj.com,</em> any 
data collected will be initially collected by HighWire within the US.&nbsp; This may 
then be transferred to and from the US as necessary. As certain parts of bmj.com 
are subscription only, you will either be a registered or non registered user 
depending on what information you wish to access. There are various sections of 
the website, for which we collect different information. What we collect and how 
this is used is as follows:</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">1.1 Non Registered Users<br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
If you access parts of <em>bmj.com</em> without a 
subscription, as you browse the website, we collect information about your use 
of the site. Essentially this will be which pages you have visited and how long 
you stay online. We will not be able to identify who you are from the 
information we store, but we will be able to identify where you are located – 
(see point 1.3 below).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>1.2 Registered Users <i>bmj</i><em><span style="font-style:normal">.</span>com</em><br>
</b><br>
You will be asked to submit details including a personal email address as well 
as your name and contact details, including your address. All mandatory 
information is indicated and is so to understand our users and so we can fulfil 
our obligations to you. We then use this information to set up a customer number 
and username and generally fulfil our obligations to you. You will be asked if 
you wish to receive general email updates and further product information from 
us and if you do you can ‘opt in’ to receive this. You will be given an 
opportunity to ‘opt out’ of this on each occasion we contact you thereafter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Apart from bmj.com subscription customers, other parts of 
bmj.com also require you to register (such as Rapid Responses, Q &amp; A, Email 
Alerts and UK Health News).&nbsp; You will be advised what information is required 
and what can be seen by us and third parties when you register.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">1.3. What else do we collect when you use our website</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Each time you use the internet, an IP address is assigned 
to your computer via the internet service provider. This number may either be 
the same or different each time. Each time your computer requests information 
from our website, we log your IP address on our server. We may use this in order 
to gather information about the website traffic and usage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whether you are a registered user or not, our web server 
collects certain information such as (a) IP address; (b) host names (c) domain 
name (d) time and date information as requested (e) the browser version and 
platform when it is requested, (f) a record of which pages have been requested, 
but we do not identify any individual from this data.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">1.4 What else do we use personal information for?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Other than for fulfilling our obligations to you (where 
these exist), on some occasions we use the information provided to produce 
aggregate statistics in relation to pages being accessed. We may also use it to 
monitor usage patterns on the website in order to improve navigation and design 
features to help you get information more easily. This information is provided 
to us as daily logged files. In order to help us develop the website and our 
services, we may provide such aggregate information to third parties. The 
statistics however will not include any information that can be used to identify 
any individual.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">2. To whom will personal information be disclosed?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We will not disclose your personal data to any third party 
other than our contractors who must keep this date secure and confidential.&nbsp; 
Corporate location information however may be shared.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">3. How long do we keep the information we collect?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We keep your personal information for as long as necessary 
to fulfil our obligations to you and protect our legal interests. This will 
never be longer than six years from the end of your subscription period.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">4. Can you change information we hold about you?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Where you have provided us with an email address or any 
information which becomes outdated, you should inform us by using the contact 
form on the website or updating your details using the “my account link” link at 
the top of the site. You must be logged in to access the “my account page”.&nbsp;
</font> </p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">5. How is personal information stored and protected</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Your personal data is stored by us in electronic and 
paper-based form. Website useage information is stored electronically.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana">Security</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The information we collect about site visitors the site, is 
stored in secure environments and we do not share any data that identifies any 
individual, to any other individual or party. We have mechanisms in place to 
protect data. One such mechanism is called a “firewall”. A firewall is a barrier 
that allows only authorised traffic through. It safeguards our computer systems 
and your information. We also use system and application logs to track all 
access. We review these logs periodically and investigate any anomalies or 
discrepancies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We understand that the security of your information is 
important to you. We also understand that our continued success as a publisher 
on the web, relies on our ability to communicate with you in a secure manner. We 
adhere to the highest standards of decency, fairness, and integrity in our 
operations. We use several measures to authenticate your identity when you visit 
our site. We also take steps to protect your information as it travels the 
internet, and to make sure all information is as secure as possible against 
unauthorised access and use (for example, by hackers). We review our security 
measures regularly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite our best efforts, and the best efforts of other 
firms, “perfect security” does not exist on the internet, or anywhere else. As a 
result, whilst we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot warrant 
the security of the information you transmit to us online. You therefore do so 
at your own risk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once we receive your transmission, we make our best efforts 
to ensure its security on our system.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana"><br>
Authentication</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You should not share your user name and password with other 
people. If you think you might lose or forget these identifiers, write them down 
and keep each in a separate place.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana"><br>
Email</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
<br>
Any email between you and BMJ Publishing Group Limited is 
not encrypted. It will be stored securely within our corporate firewall (see 
below).&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana"><br>

Access to our website is dependent upon the use of session 
cookies. Most browsers allow the users to control the cookies including whether
