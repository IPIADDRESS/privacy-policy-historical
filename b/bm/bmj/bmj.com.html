<em>Registered
Users</em></p>
<p>Many of
our websites require subscriptions and/or registration to access certain
functions, services or content. You will know what information is being
collected via these processes when you complete the relevant forms and provide
the required details prior to submitting the application for the relevant
subscription or registration.</p>
<p>On some
of our websites, where you submit a response for publication your name and
other personal details may be published. You should check the policy on the
relevant submission page on the specific BMJ operated website.</p>
<p>We will
collect data relating to any transactions you carry out through our website(s)
and of the fulfilment of your orders.</p>
<p>We
collate data about registered users including which BMJ publications and
services they have subscribed to in order that we can understand our customers
and try and easily fulfil their subscription requirements.</p>
<p>Where you
have supplied information relating to a conference (for instance where you are
attending a conference, or speaking at a conference), we will use your personal
data to inform the venue and caterers of delegates, share that information with
any co-owners, co-organisers or relevant suppliers and contractors of a
conference (where applicable). We may also use your data to create a delegate or
speaker list which will be distributed to all attendees and sponsors.</p>
<p>Once you
start using our sites, we may track and keep a record of the pages you visit.
We collect this data from groups of users to get a sense of how people are
using our sites and what content and which business areas or sections of the
site are most popular. This helps us improve what we offer on our sites.</p>
<p>We will
also use your data to monitor for any unauthorised use of our websites, content
or subscriptions to our publications (for example individuals subscribing
individually on behalf of institutions).</p>
<p>We may
also disclose your identity and contact details to any third party claiming
material posted by you is defamatory or violates their intellectual property
rights or right to privacy.</p>
<p>You will
be given at least one opportunity to opt in or out (as applicable) from
receiving marketing emails from the BMJ and third parties. For users who have
opted to receive marketing emails from BMJ (and others where indicated and
there is a jointly supplied product or service), and visit our websites through
links provided in these emails, we may send information about your website
usage to our third party email direct marketing provider. This is for the
purpose of understanding the effectiveness of our email marketing campaigns and
for targeting future email campaigns.</p>
<p>1.2. <em>BMJ Learning Users</em></p>
<p>In
addition to and subject to other uses of your personal data which are set out
herein (see clause 3 in
particular), the information that you add to your BMJ Portfolio, including the
areas of improvement you identify, the BMJ Learning modules you have started
and /or completed, and other such information, is considered private save that
our technicians have access to it in order to fix problems and maintain the
site. However, subject to clause 3 and the
BMA exception described below we do not read this information unless it is necessary
to do so, and we will not release it to other people or organisations, without
your prior consent.</p>
<p>In the
case of BMJ Learning and BMJ Portfolio only (and in accordance with clause 3(vii)), we may
disclose certain personal data to the British Medical Association <strong>(“BMA”)</strong> including in relation to the
fact that you have signed up for access to BMJ Learning, the modules that you have
started, completed, passed or failed and any feedback you have given in
relation to the modules.</p>
<p>We
reserve the right to release anonymised group data to third parties related to
the use of specific modules. You are able to give feedback about a learning
module after completing it, and in the learning resources section of the site.
This information is visible to other users of the site, including guest users.
We will also use it to improve our site.</p>
<p>1.3. <em>Foundation
Programme Users</em></p>
<p>The forms
you complete online and the learning modules you complete (including obtaining
certificates of completion) are considered private. Our technicians have access
to them in order to fix problems and maintain the site. However, we do not read
this information unless necessary, and will not release it to other people or
organisations, without your prior consent.</p>
<p>1.4. <em>Portfolio
Users</em></p>
<p>Subject
to clause 3(vii), the
data you enter into the BMJ Portfolio website, and any files you upload to it,
is considered private. Our technicians have access to this data in order to fix
problems and maintain the site. We may statistically analyse the information,
in aggregate form, to learn more about the interests of our user base. These
statistics may be used to provide functionality that recommends useful
resources to other users of BMJ Portfolio. In no case will it be possible to
identify an individual through such functionality, or through the underlying
aggregate data.</p>
<p><em>1.5. </em><em>BMJ Quality Improvement Programme Users</em></p>
<p>Where you have registered and/or purchased access
to a BMJ Quality Improvement Programme product or service, your name will be
available for other users for the purpose of contacting you through the
service. They will not have access to your contact information directly (unless
such information is included on a report you have written, which is published)
instead, you will be sent an invitation via your BMJ account and if you accept
such invitation you may choose to communicate through these means.</p>
<p>1.6. <em>All users</em></p>
<p>As you
browse our websites, we collect information about your use of the site
including but not limited to traffic data and location data. Essentially this
will normally be which pages you have visited, how long you stay online and
where you are located. We will not be able to identify who you are from the
information we store, but we will be able to identify where you are located -
(see point 1.7 below).</p>
<p><a name="_Ref353975991" id="_Ref353975991">1.7. <em>What else
do we collect when you use one of our website</em></a><em>s?</em></p>
<p>Each time
you use the internet, an Internet Protocol <strong>(“IP”)</strong>
address is assigned to your computer or internet-capable device via the
internet service provider. This number may either be the same or different each
time you access the internet. Each time your computer or internet-capable
device requests information from one of our websites, we log your IP address on
our server. We may also log operating systems and browser types for the purposes
of system administration and to report aggregate information. We may use this
in order to gather information about the website traffic and usage.</p>
<p>To
clarify, whether you are a registered user or not, our web server collects
certain information including (a) IP address; (b) host names (c) domain name
(d) time and date information as requested (e) the browser version and platform
when it is requested, (f) a record of which pages have been requested (g)
location data from your IP address. Location data may be necessary for us to
“geo-block” or regionalise our website content or services.</p>
<p>If you
contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence and use it to contact
you and/or to update our records. We may use all information we obtain to
enforce our legal rights and protect against unauthorised access, use, activity
and/or copying, either personally or via third party contractors and advisors.
This may involve using your name and subscription details on a database with
other publishers’ data for detection purposes.</p>
<p>1.8. <em>What else
do we use personal information for?</em></p>
<p>Other
than for fulfilling our obligations to you (where these exist), on some
occasions we use the information you provide to produce aggregate statistics in
relation to pages being accessed. We may also use it to monitor usage patterns
on our websites in order to improve navigation and design features and to help
you get information more easily. This information is provided to us as daily
log files. In order to help us develop our websites and our services, we may
provide such aggregate information to third parties. The statistics however
will not include any information that can be used to identify any individual.
We may contact you to notify you about changes to our service. We also may send
you non marketing emails which includes for internal record keeping and to
improve our services and/or for the purpose of inviting you to partake in surveys
or market research which we conduct or which third parties are conducting.</p>
<p>In
addition to responding to complaints or claims received or discovered referred
to above or any breaches of our Website Terms and Conditions, we may use all
information supplied or collected on our Websites to enforce our legal rights
and protect against unauthorised access, use, activity and/or copying, either
personally or via third party contractors and advisors and/or protect the
rights, property, or personal safety other users of the websites and the

</strong><strong>How personal information stored and protected</strong></p>
<p>Your
personal data is stored in our databases or those of our contractorswhich
is only available to the web administrators of us and our contractors and
selected authorised people on a password protected basis (except where referred
to in the final paragraph of Clause 1.3 herein). The data that we collect from
you may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside of the European
Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside of
the EEA who work for us or are of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in
among other things, hosting the fulfilment of your order, processing of your
payment details and the provision of support services by submitting your
personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or process. We will take all
steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely by us
and our contractors and in accordance with this privacy policy. Where we have
given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access
certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password
confidential. Please do not share your password(s) with anyone.</p>
<p><strong>4.1.
</strong><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>We
understand that the security of your information is important to you. We also
understand that our continued success as a publisher on the web relies on our
ability to communicate with you in a secure manner. We adhere to the highest
standards of decency, fairness, and integrity in our operations. We use several
measures to authenticate your identity when you visit our site. We also take
steps to protect your information as it travels the internet, and to make sure
all information is as secure as possible against unauthorised access and use
(for example, by hackers). We review our security measures regularly. Despite
our best efforts, and the best efforts of other firms, "perfect
security" does not exist on the internet, or anywhere else. Unfortunately,
the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee
the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your
own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures
and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
<p><strong>4.2.
<em>Authentication</em></strong></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">You should not share your user name and password
with other people. If you think you might lose or forget these identifiers,
write them down and keep each in a separate place.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><strong>4.3.
<em>Email</em></strong></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">Any email between you and the BMJ is not encrypted.
It will be stored securely within our corporate firewall (see below).</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><strong>4.4.
<em>Data
within our walls</em></strong></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">The information we collect about people visiting
the site is stored in secure environments that are not available to any other
individual or party. We have mechanisms in place to protect data. One such
mechanism is called a "firewall." A firewall is a barrier that allows
only authorised traffic through. It safeguards our computer systems and your
information. We also use system and application logs to track all access. We

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><strong></strong></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><strong>5.1.
</strong><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are small text files which a
website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a
website. Cookies are widely used by websites to help remember small amounts of
information and give you a better experience using the website. For example, a
cookie will help the website to recognise your device the next time you visit
so you don’t have to log on again, they will remember what items you placed in
a shopping basket or recall your preferences such as which language you want to
read a site in.</p>
<p>Certain
cookies contain a limited amount of personal information. For example, if you
click “remember me” when logging in, a cookie will store your username. Most
cookies won’t collect information that identifies <strong>you</strong>, and will instead collect more general information to help us
analyse how well our website is performing overall so we can try and improve
it.</p>
<p>5.2.
<strong>How
we use Cookies</strong></p>
<p>BMJ uses cookies on most of our websites
to perform different functions. These are grouped into four main categories:</p>
<p><strong><em>Technically Necessary Cookies</em></strong></p>
<p>Some essential functions of our websites
are only possible if information is stored persistently between each page you
look at. For instance, if you log in to a site to access subscriber only
content, we use a cookie to remember that you are logged in, so you do not have
to enter your details on each page you visit.</p>
<p><strong><em>Customisation and Personalisation Cookies</em></strong></p>
<p>In order to allow you as an individual, or
our institutional customers, to customise our products and websites, we need to
remember who you are and what you want. We use cookies to record your
preferences regarding website appearance, what content you’ve already read, and
to present the information that is most relevant to you.</p>
<p><strong><em>Performance Monitoring Cookies</em></strong></p>
<p>We utilise other cookies to analyse how
our visitors use our websites and to monitor website performance. This allows
us to provide a high quality experience by customising our offering and quickly
identifying and fixing any issues that arise. When we send marketing emails to
users who have chosen to receive them, we use a cookie that lets us track the
success of campaigns. We may use this information to determine which of our
emails are more interesting to users, or to query whether users who do not open
our emails wish to continue receiving them. We don’t use cookies to find out
how specific individuals use our products, only to gather general statistics
that can help us give you a better experience.</p>
<p><strong><em>Third Party Cookies</em></strong></p>
<p>BMJ websites sometimes integrate with
other companies’ sites. For example, we integrate with social networking sites
such as Twitter and Facebook, to make it easier for you to share what you have
read. These sites place their own cookies on your browser as a result of us
including their icons and ‘like’ or ‘share’ buttons on our sites. Like most
commercial publishers we also sell advertising space, or ‘banner ads’ on some
of our websites. These ads are served directly from a 3<sup>rd</sup> party
advertising broker. They place cookies on your browser in order to track how
many people have seen a particular ad, and for other technical reasons.</p>
<p><strong>5.3.
</strong><strong>How
to remove or block Cookies</strong></p>
<p>Your internet browser has tools that allow
you to remove or block cookies. More information can be found here: <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/">http://www.aboutcookies.org/</a></p>
<p><strong>5.4.
</strong><strong>What
will happen if I block BMJ Cookies?</strong></p>
<p>Depending on which cookies you block, the
site may stop working, or certain features may stop working correctly. If the
cookies marked below as ‘technically necessary’ are blocked, the site will
probably not be usable.</p>
