<h3>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h3>

<p>BarebackBastards allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the BarebackBastards Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the BarebackBastards Sites.

They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.</p>

<p>BarebackBastards does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks BarebackBastards to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.</p>
