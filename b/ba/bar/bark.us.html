    <p>d.  <b>Data Processor Obligations</b>. To the extent that we are a Data Processor on your behalf, we shall (a) implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard any User Data against any unauthorized or unlawful access, loss, destruction, theft, use or disclosure; (b) limit access to User Data only to those employees who need to know it to enable us to perform the Services; (c) only process the User Data as specified by this Privacy Policy and in accordance with your instructions, and (d) will not use the User Data for any purposes other than those related to the performance of the Services or pursuant to your written instructions. Upon the expiry or termination of this Agreement by way of de-registration, or upon your request, we will cease any and all use of the User Data and will destroy it. Other than as described in this Privacy Policy or the applicable Terms of Service, we will not disclose User Data to any third party without your prior written consent or pursuant to court or administrative order.</p>
    <p>e.  <b>Subcontracting</b>. As Data Processor we may provide access to any User Data to a subcontractor processor if we reasonably consider such access and processing necessary to the performance of the Services. In the event of such access and before the access takes place, we shall ensure that an agreement with the third party is in place which is sufficient to require it to treat personal data in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Privacy Policy. In particular, you authorize us to subcontract to the third parties mentioned in the following section on international transfers.</p>
    <p>f.   <b>Data removal</b>. We generally retain your User Data on an identifiable basis for 30 days, after which it is deleted.  We may retain portions of your User Data indefinitely as needed for the purpose of providing reports to you concerning your Covered Account(s).  If you wish to remove all the User Data in your Bark account, please uninstall Bark from your devices, and send an email (as set out below), with a digital copy of your ID or other identification document to prove your identity. Once your identity is confirmed, we will immediately remove all of your Data from our active systems and back-ups within fifteen (15) days from confirmation of identity (except as indicated below). Each Covered Account’s User Data is controlled by the Covered Account and/or you as a Data Controller. We do not control any User Data and can not and will not provide access in response to any Covered Account’s request to review or correct errors in his/her User Data. We will forward any such requests received by us to you and you will be responsible for responding to any such requests.</p>
    <p>g.  <b>Warranties. You, as the party responsible for User Data that we process on your behalf as Data Processor for the provision of the Services, represent and warrant to us that:<br>
    i.  You comply with all applicable laws with respect to the monitoring and control of devices and applications used by you or your Covered Accounts; and<br>
    ii. You have all legally required informed consents from each and every data subject, including without limitation, each Covered Account, whose personal data are submitted to us in the course of the provision of the Services or collected and transmitted to us by the Services.</b></p>
    <p>h.  <b>Indemnity</b>. You agree to indemnify and keep us harmless from all claims, damages and losses we may suffer relating to or arising out of the processing of User Data and other third party personal data submitted to our systems during the course of your use and our provision of the Services.</p>
    <p>6.  <u>International Transfers of Data</u>. We use third party technological services for the provision of Services, whose providers may process Registration Data and User Data collected in the course of providing us their services indicated below, as sub-processors. You authorize us to subcontract the following services and the corresponding transfer of User Data to the entities and countries listed below:</p>

We have adopted technical and organizational measures to preserve and protect your personal informationData (including User Data) that we monitor from unauthorized use or access and from being altered, lost or misused, taking into account the technological state of art, the features of the information stored and the risks to which information is exposed. However, due to the nature of the information and related technology, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of your personal informationData and expressly disclaim any such obligation. If we learn of a security breach, then we will attempt to notify you electronically as soon as reasonably possible so that you can take appropriate steps. You have a role in the security of your information and you are responsible to make sure your log-in information is kept from other people.

If we receive instructions using your log-in information we will consider that you have authorized the instructions.</p>
    <p>8.  <u>Analytics and other anonymous data use</u>. For the purpose of improving our services and providing sector/segment reports, we anonymize your Registration Data and User Data and store and process this data on an anonymous basis, even if your Account has been closed. The principal purpose is to analyze on an aggregated non-identifiable basis how our Services are used, measuring their effectiveness, and providing general customer service. We may also provide this data (or parts of it) on a fully anonymous aggregate basis to third party business partners, including for conducting academic research and surveys or commercial analytics, and to publish periodic sector or segmented information and reports about behavior patterns and tendencies.</p>
    <p>9.  <u>Accessing Your Information and Your Choices</u>. You have the right to access, rectify, erase, block and oppose any processing of your personal data that we may have.

If you block cookies performance of the Site may be impaired and certain features may not function at all. Moreover, you may at any time withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data and information.

The aforementioned rights may be exercised by contacting us at help@bark.us or by mailing us at Bark Technologies Inc., P.O. Box 1841, Richmond Hill, GA 31324.
