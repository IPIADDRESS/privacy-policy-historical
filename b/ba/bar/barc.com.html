    Barc Privacy Policy
  </h1>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes Barc's policies and procedures regarding the collection, use
    and disclosure of your information. Barc receives your information through our various
    services, application(s) and website(s) (<strong>"Services"</strong>). For example, you send us information
    when you register for a Barc account, download Barc software from our web site, post
    text and other content and otherwise use the Services. When using any of our Services you
    consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your
    information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in
    or create information from, your information may be used by Barc in the United States and
    anywhere in the world where Barc operates and you use the Services.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy is part of the Barc Terms of Service (<strong>â€œTermsâ€</strong>) available at <a href="/terms-and-conditions.php">Terms of
    Service</a>, including the <a href="/values-and-rules.php">Barc Values and Rules</a>, which you agree to upon registration and by
    your use of the Services. Please read these policies carefully. If you have any questions or
    comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@Barc.com">info@Barc.com</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h2>
    Collection and Use of Information We Receive From You
  </h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Information Collected Upon Registration:</strong> When you create or change a Barc account,
    you provide the following personal information: your username, password, and email
    address (optional). This information is not public, except your username, which is listed
    publicly on our Services, including on your HomeScreen, in chats and in search results.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Email:</strong> It is your choice whether to provide your email address to us and is entirely
    optional. We recommend that you do so, as your email address will only be used by us
    for security or enforcement purposes. We will not use your email address to send you
    information about our Services or to market to you, nor will we give or sell your e-mail
    to third parties for marketing purposes. If you email us for any reason, we may keep your
    message, email address and contact information to respond to your request.
  </p>
  <p>  
    <strong>HomeScreen Information:</strong> When you use the Services, you create a HomeScreen which
    contains your username, chat rooms, and names of locations people come to you from.
    Your Friends List and Private Chats are always private to the users in the Private Chat.
    However, the other information on your HomeScreen is public unless you choose to limit
    access to this information by blocking off your HomeScreen from everyone or by blocking
    individual users in the Barc Options.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Your Content:</strong> Our Services allow you to browse the Web and chat with other users
    browsing the same site(s) and to participate in discussions on any common topic of
    interest. Much of the information you provide to us is information you are asking us to
    make public and will be accessible to other users of the Services as well as the general
    public. This includes any chats, text, opinions, reviews and other information, graphics,
    photos, video or other materials posted, transmitted, uploaded, downloaded or appearing
    on the Services (<strong>â€œContentâ€</strong>). Our default is to make the Content you provide public.
    The exception to this is your Private Chats, which are always private. Content from
    your Private Chats is never publicly available and is deleted when the chat is closed. In
    addition, we give you option of making certain Content and other information unavailable
    if you want by using certain privacy settings available at Barc Options.
  </p>
  <p class="bold">
    It is important that you understand that your Content (except in Private Chats)
    and other public information is broadly and instantly disseminated and may be
    searchable by everyone, including search engines, except to the extent you have opted
    to limit access to such information (see Barc Options). If you use the Services to post
    or otherwise disclose personal information about yourself, except in Private Chats or
    to the extent you have opted to limit access to such information, all others using the
    Services and the general public have access to the personal information you provide.
    Please carefully read the Terms at <a href="/terms-and-conditions.php">Terms of Service</a>, including the <a href="/values-and-rules.php">Barc Values and
    Rules</a>, regarding ownership, use of and restrictions on Content.
  </p>
  
  <h2>
    Collection and Use of Your Activity and Usage Information
  </h2>
  <p>
    Barc, other users and the public have access to information regarding the activity and use
    of the Services occurring under your username, including the frequency of use, website
    browsing and preferences and chat room activity and other usage information, except in
    connection with Private Chats and Friends Lists and when you select certain limited access
    settings under Barc Options. Barcâ€™s servers do not automatically record information
    created by your use of the Services, although it may elect to do so from time to time under
    limited circumstances to ensure that we continue to provide a safe, efficient, and lawful
    experience. Specifically, we may use this information (i) to provide our services and
    features to you and to measure and improve those services and features, (ii) to provide
    you with customer support, (iii) for research, marketing and advertising purposes, (iv) to
    prevent potentially illegal or harmful activities, and (v) to enforce the Terms. For example,
    we may log your IP address if your account has been banned, for enforcement of the Terms
    or as required by law.
  </p>
  
  <h2>
    Collection and Use of Information We Receive From Third Parties
  </h2>
  <p>
    We may institute programs with advertising partners and websites in which they share
    information with us. For example, we may ask advertisers to tell us how our users
    responded to the ads we showed them (and for comparison purposes, how other users who
    didnâ€™t see the ads acted on their site). This data sharing, commonly known as â€œconversion
    tracking,â€ helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the
    advertisements you see.
  </p>
  
  <h2>
    Privacy Settings
  </h2>
  <p>
    The <a href="/terms-and-conditions.php">Barc Values and Rules</a> states that our mission includes promoting public discussion
    and free speech while protecting your privacy. To promote these twin goals, our default
    is that all Content, HomeScreen and non-personal information, except Friends Lists and
    Private Chats, is freely accessible by all, although we do provide you the option of limiting
    access in certain essential ways under the Barc Options.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Information Sharing and Disclosure
  </h2>
  <p>
    Service Providers: We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and
    provide services to us, such as hosting our Services. We may share your information with
    these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide
    these services, under agreements which provide the same protections to your information
    that we do.
  </p>
  <p>
    Law and Harm: We may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is
    reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the rights
    or safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; to protect Barc's
    rights; or property or enforce the Terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Business Transfers: In the event that Barc is involved in a bankruptcy, merger,
    acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as
    part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information
    as transferred to the new entity.
  </p>
  
  <h2>  
    Modifying Your Personal Information
  </h2>
  <p>
    If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools to access or modify
    the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account at Manage
    Account under Barc Options.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also permanently delete your Barc account. If you follow the instructions at
    Manage Account your account will be deactivated and then deleted. For up to 30 days it is
    still possible to restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. After
    30 days, we begin the process of deleting your account from our systems, which may not
    be immediate. All Content you posted prior to deletion of your account (other than that in
    Private Chats) will remain posted on the Services.
  </p>
  
  <h2>
    Our Policy Toward Children
  </h2>
  <p>  
    Our Terms require that you must be 18 years or older to use the Services. If you become
    aware that a child under 18 is using the Services, please delete their account. If we become
    aware that a child under 18 has opened a Barc account, we will terminate the child's
    account.
  </p>
  
  <h2>
    California Residents
  </h2>
  <p>
    California law permits residents who have provided personal information to us to request
    information about disclosure of personal information to third parties for their marketing
    purposes. As detailed above, we do not disclose personal information collected online or
    otherwise for any third party's direct marketing purposes. However, users may contact us
    at <a href="mailto:info@barc.com">info@barc.com</a> if they have any questions regarding this policy.
  </p>
  
  <h2>
    Security
  </h2>
  <p>
    We take your security seriously and take reasonable steps to protect your information that
    you have elected to keep private. However, no data transmissions over the Internet can be
    guaranteed to be 100% secure, consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of
    any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. We take reasonable,
    appropriate steps to protect against unauthorized access to, and disclosure of, personal
    information. However, we cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed,
    disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any firewalls or secure server software we may
    employ.
