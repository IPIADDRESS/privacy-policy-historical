<h2>Who we share with?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like virtually every company, we do use third party companies to provide some parts of our service, so when you are making payments for example, you will need to give your payment details to our payments provider. &nbsp;Rest assured the people we work with are trusted by millions and have excellent safeguards themselves.</span></p>
