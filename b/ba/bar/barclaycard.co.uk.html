<h2><img src="/media/graphic_text/how_will_we_use_the_information_we_br_collect_about_you__003366__FFFFFF_12.png" height="51" width="261" alt="How will we use the information we collect about you?" border="0"></h2>
<p>We will store and process your information on the Barclays Group computers and in any other way.
By "your information" we mean personal and financial information we (a) obtain from you or from
third parties, such as credit reference agencies ( who may search the Electoral Register),
fraud prevention agencies or other organisations when you apply for an account or any other product
or service for which you or they give to us at any other time or (b) learn from the way you use and
manage your account(s), from the transactions you make such as the date, amount, currency and the
name and type of supplier (eg supermarket services, medical services, retail services) and
from the payments which are made to your account.</p>

<p>We and other companies in the Barclays Group will use your information to manage your account(s),
give you statements and provide our services, for assessment and analysis (including credit and/or
behaviour scoring, market and product analysis), and to develop and improve our services to you and
other customers and protect our interests.</p>

<p>We and other members of the Barclays Group will use your information to inform you by letter,
telephone (including automated dialling, digital television and sending text messages), or computer
about products and services (including those of others) which may be of interest to you.</p>

<p>We use credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>make enquiries when you ask for any lending products, or to assist us in
    managing your account, for example if we wish to consider changing your credit
    limit, or offering you other products, now or in the future;</li>
    <li>share information:</li>
    <li>about you and how you manage your accounts;</li>
    <li>if you give us false or inaccurate information or we suspect fraud.</li>
    <li>Credit reference agencies keep a record of our enquiries and may record,
    use and give out information we give them to other lenders, insurers and other
    organisations. This also applies to fraud prevention agencies if you give us
    false or inaccurate information or we suspect fraud. The information may be
    used to make assessments for credit and to help make decisions on you and members
    of your household, on credit, motor, household, life, and other insurance facilities
    (including handling claims), for debt tracing and to prevent fraud and money laundering.
    Information held about you by the credit reference agencies may already be linked to
    records relating to one or more of your partners where a financial “association”
    has been created. Any enquiry we make at a credit reference agency may be assessed with
    reference to any “associated” records.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may give information about you and how you manage your account to the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>People who provide a service to us or are acting as our agents, on the understanding
    that they will keep the information confidential.</li>
    <li>Anyone to whom we transfer or may transfer our rights and duties under this agreement.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also give out information about you if we have a duty to do so or if the law allows us to do so.</p>

<p>Otherwise we will keep information about you confidential.</p>

<p>If we transfer your information to a service provider or agent in another country,
we will make sure that the service provider or agent agrees to apply the same levels of
protection as we are required to apply to information held in the UK and to use your
information only for the purpose of providing the service to us.</p>

<p>If you don't want us to tell you about other products and services please write to us at
Dept MTRM, Northampton NN4&nbsp;7SG and supply us with details of any products you have with us.</p>

<p>We may need to pass on your information to people who provide a service to us
(although we only do this on the understanding that they keep your information confidential),
and anyone to whom we may transfer our rights and duties. We may also disclose your
information if we have a duty to do so or if the law allows us to.</p>

<p>If we transfer your information to a service provider in another country,
we will make sure that the service provider agrees to apply the same levels

<p>We will not keep your information for longer than is necessary and will take steps
to ensure that it is kept up to date. You have a right under the Data Protection Act 1998
to ask what information we hold about you. You can do this by writing to us at Barclaycard,
