				<p>The London Borough of Barnet has developed a commissioning model which places great importance on using data and information about the borough, its residents and service users, to develop strategies and make decisions. A commissioning model gives us greater scope to tailor services to the needs of users and greatly increases the likelihood of us achieving our aims and objectives.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>This privacy notice explains how the council uses the
information you give us and how it ensures that it is appropriately protected.&nbsp; As a ‘commissioning council’ we work with a
number of partner organisations to deliver services, further details on this
are in the “Who do we share information with?” section below. </p> 
  <div class="snippet"><a href="http://www.barnet.gov.uk/privacy#cookies">An explanation of how we use cookies on this website can be found further down this page</a>.<!-- rel:snippet --></div> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>We endeavour to safeguard the privacy of our residents, service users and website visitors. This statement explains what you can expect in regards to how we collect and use your information.</p> 
  <h3>Why
we collect personal information</h3> 
  <p>As a local authority we collect and process a considerable amount of information that is required in order for us to undertake our functions as a local authority. Any personal information we hold is processed in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act or DPA). </p> 
  <p>The council’s privacy statement applies to all personal data collected for or on behalf of the council whether by letter, email, face to face, telephone or online. </p> 
  <p>Call recording - Not all council services record or monitor telephone calls. Where we do, this will be made clear to you via an automated message at the start of your call.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <h3>What do we use
personal information for? </h3> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>We use information in a number of different ways: </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>For the purpose for which you provided the information eg processing information given
on a benefit claim form for the purpose of handling your benefit claim, and to
monitor the council’s performance in responding to your request.</li> 
    <li>To
allow the council to communicate and provide services appropriate to your needs
eg providing assistance to new parents, highlighting any free services or
additional help available to you.</li> 
    <li>For insight purposes which allows us to analyse patterns and
trends of service usage. We use this insight for service and financial planning to help us create policy and inform decision making eg allowing us to place children’s centres in areas where they are most needed.</li> 
    <li>To ensure that the council meets its duties, including obligations imposed under
the Equality and Health and Safety Acts.</li> 
    <li>Where necessary for law enforcement functions eg licensing, planning enforcement,
trading standards and food safety where the council is legally obliged to
undertake such processing.</li> 
    <li>Where the processing is necessary to comply with legal obligations eg the prevention
and/or detection of crime.</li> 
    <li>To process financial transactions including grants, payments and benefits
involving the council, or where the council is acting on behalf of other
government bodies eg Department for Work and Pensions.</li> 
    <li>To allow us to verify your identity when seeking services from the council.</li> 
    <li>Where otherwise permitted under the Data Protection Act 1998. For further information
on the DPA refer to the <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/" title="Information Commissioner’s website ">Information
Commissioner’s website</a>.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>We are keen to ensure that we are providing our citizens with services that they need. Therefore, we may contact you for the purpose of making you aware of services or support which we think may be of interest to you. </p> 
  <p>From time to time we may also seek your feedback on how we are performing or seek your views on services which you have been using. </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <h3>Who do we share information with? </h3> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>Information the council collects is routinely shared between council services as well as with other third parties such as government bodies, the police, health and social care organisations and educational establishments. </p> 
  <p>As a ‘commissioning council’ we work with a number of partner organisations and
contracted service providers to deliver services. These include: Barnet Homes for the delivery of housing services; Your Choice Barnet for provision of specialist social care
and support to adults; Capita via the Customer Support Group (CSG) contract for
services such as HR and Revenues and Benefits; the joint venture company Re
Limited for delivery of services such as planning and environmental health.</p> 
  <p>Additionally
we have a number of partnering arrangements for services such as public health
and legal services. We only share
information with these organisations where it is appropriate and legal to do
so. The council requires its third parties to abide by the Data Protection
Act 1998 and routinely undertakes checks with its providers before information
is shared, to ensure that there are sufficient systems and procedures in place
to protect your information.</p> 
  <p>View the council's <a href="http://www.barnet.gov.uk/info/940475/information_sharing_charter/1191/information_sharing_charter">Information Charter</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
  <h3><strong>Insight </strong></h3> 
  <p>As a local authority we are constantly looking at ways of improving how
we provide services to our residents and service users, as we are
required to do by law. The information you provide us with in
your day-to-day dealings helps us to create an understanding about who our customers are and how they use our services.
By bringing together and analysing customer information that the council holds
(creating insight) it will allow us to deliver high quality services where they
are most needed. </p> 
  <h3><strong>My Account - Single Customer View </strong></h3> 
  <p>Customers will be able to follow a
registration process to create a ‘My Account’ on the council’s website. It is
envisaged that My Account will hold a brief summary of contact you have
had with the council’s Customer Services, as well as general information such
as your address, date of birth and gender. It will also be used by officers delivering
customer services to enable them to respond to any queries you may have more
quickly and efficiently. </p> 
  <h3><strong>Data Matching </strong></h3> 
  <p>We routinely check information provided by
you or information supplied by an external organisation about you against other
information held by the council. The council may also obtain information from
certain external organisations or provide information to them in order to: </p> 
  <ul type="disc"> 
    <li>verify
 the accuracy of the information we hold </li> 
    <li>prevent
 or detect crime </li> 
    <li>protect
 public funds from fraud </li> 
    <li>comply
 with the council's legal obligations </li> 
    <li>assist
 with research and statistical purposes </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The Audit Commission also requires local
authorities to participate in data matching exercises which assist in the
prevention and/or detection of fraud. Data matching by the Audit Commission is
subject to a Code of Practice and further information can be located on the <a href="http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/national-fraud-initiative/">Audit Commission</a> website.<strong> </strong></p> 
  <h3><strong>Access to Information </strong></h3> 
  <p>Under the Data
Protection Act 1998, you can have the right to make a formal request for personal
information the council hold about you.&nbsp; This is known as a <strong>Subject
Access Request</strong>. For more information
visit our <a href="http://www.barnet.gov.uk/info/200031/data_protection_and_freedom_of_information/185/data_protection_and_freedom_of_information">data protection page</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
  <h3><strong>Visitors to
our websites </strong></h3> 
  <p>When someone
visits our website we collect routine internet log information, which allows us
to see visitor behaviour patterns.&nbsp; We do this to determine which pages
are being viewed as this assists us in improving our website. &nbsp; </p> 
  <p>Internet log information is collected in a
way which doesn’t allow us to identify you and we do not make any attempts to
find out the identities of individuals visiting our site. </p>
