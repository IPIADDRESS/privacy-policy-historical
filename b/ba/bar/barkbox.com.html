<h1>Barkbox Privacy Policy</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Barkbox knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly.  This notice describes our privacy policy for the Barkbox.com web site (the “Site”).</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact us at <a href="mailto:support@barkbox.com">support@barkbox.com.</a></p>
<p>This privacy policy covers only information that is collected through the Site and does not cover websites to which we link.</p>

<h3>Notice of Information We Collect And How We Use It</h3>
<p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.</p>
<p>In general, our collection and use of information is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Barkbox will not sell or disclose your name or email address to third parties without your explicit consent, except as specified in this privacy policy.</li>
  <li>When you subscribe to Barkbox, we will collect personal information such as your name, e-mail address, shipping address and credit card information. We use this information to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. All archived credit card information is maintained in a secure and safe environment as described in this privacy policy.</li>
  <li>Barkbox automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookies, and the pages you request.</li>
  <li>Barkbox uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provisioning, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, research, and anonymous reporting. IP addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. Your IP address is stored in Barkbox's user registration databases when you register with Barkbox. IP addresses may be used for various research purposes, and/or delivering unique functionality to our service.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Information We Collect About Anonymous Visitors</h3>
<p>We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Site. We use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community.</p>
<h4>Log Files</h4>
<p>Like many Web sites, we automatically gather certain information about our Site traffic and store it in log files.  This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base.</p>
<p>We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We use a third-party tracking service that uses log files and cookies, see below, to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to the Site in the aggregate.  This service captures usage and volume statistics.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies on this site.  As noted above, we [do not] link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.  This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by the Site only and does not cover.</p>
<p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies. See “Third Party Advertisers.”</p>

<h4>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h4>
<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs, also referred to as web beacons or web bugs, that help manage content on the Site by tracking what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We [do not] tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>

<h3>Information We Collect To Respond To Your Choices and Requests</h3>
<h4>Registration</h4>
<p>In order to use some features of this Site, you must first subscriber to the Barkbox   service.  During registration you are required to give truthful contact information (such as name and email address) in accordance with our terms of use. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.</p>
<h4>Orders</h4>
<p>If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as a credit card number and expiration date).</p>

<h4>Surveys or Contests</h4>
<p>We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site.  If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information.</p>
<p>We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic, or to personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys) and to send participants an email newsletter.</p>

<h4>Tell-A-Friend</h4>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Barkbox does not store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.</p>
<p>Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@barkbox.com">support@barkbox.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
<p>The Site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Barkbox. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy policies of such other sites.</p>
<p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Site and to read the privacy policies of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>This privacy policy applies only to information collected by the Site.</p>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  </p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make changes that materially affect our uses or disclosures of personally identifiable information that we have previously collected, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>

<h3>Contact Us</h3>
