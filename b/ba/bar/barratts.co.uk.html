    <span class="content" unselectable="off"><h2>Barratts Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><font size="2">Barratts is committed to protecting the privacy of the personal information you provide us on our website. We believe it is important for you to know what information we collect and how we treat the information you share with us. The following policy will explain how your personal information will be treated as you use our website and its features. “Personal Information” includes your name, physical address, e-mail address(es), telephone numbers, credit card information and other similar information that you provide to us. We do not sell your Personal Information. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">We will only share your Personal Information outside the Stylo family of companies and franchisees with your consent - as required by law or to protect Stylo, its customers or the public, with companies that help Stylo fulfill its obligations with you, and then only with partners who share Stylo commitment to protecting your online privacy. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">In each of the instances above, we may ask for your Personal Information in order to provide you the services or offers. In the case of actions listed above, you will be able to “unsubscribe” to these at any time. It is completely optional for you to register, participate or otherwise provide us with Personal Information in the above situations.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">How your information is used</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The information you provide helps Barratts understand how you use our website. This allows us to recognise your needs and continue to make the improvements that are important to you and our customers.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Barratts will not disclose or transfer your Personal Information to third parties without your consent or as otherwise set forth in this privacy policy. If you have opted-in we may use your Personal Information to respond to specific requests and to send notices of new products, special offers and other marketing materials to enhance and support your relationship with Barratts. These communications may take the form of postal mail, telephone calls, e-mail and other methods of contact. Also, agents, service providers and other contractors of Barratts who will have access to your Personal Information are required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to fulfill the services they are performing for Barratts.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Additionally, if you have opted-in to receiving marketing or other information from our third party business partners, you may receive marketing or other communications directly from those third parties. Barratts encourages you to read the privacy policies of each and every third party company and website that collects your Personal Information. However, whether you are receiving mailings directly from us or from our third party business partners, you will be able to “unsubscribe” to these mailings at any time.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Unsubscribing and data removal</font></p>
<p><font size="2">If your Personal Information changes (such as post code, phone, e-mail or postal address), or if you no longer desire to be contacted about our products and services, you can correct, update or delete/deactivate your Personal Information at any time. This can be done by e-mailing Barratts. If you have previously unsubscribed or opted-out through the Barratts website but you are still receiving notices, offers or solicitation relating to Barratts, it could be that you initially opted-in to receive information in a manner other than through our website (such as a collection and drawing of business cards held at a Barratts retailer units in which the winner is contacted by e-mail). If this is the case, your desire to unsubscribe may also need to be communicated to the original "opt-in" source. We take your online privacy very seriously, so if you need any assistance in unsubscribing to future communications please contact Barratts. We will promptly take action to ensure that you are “opted-out” from receiving any further mailing or other information. Although we will remove your name from our e-mail list as quickly as possible, please recognise that there may be a period of time after you unsubscribe during which you may still receive e-mails from us.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Children’s Privacy</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Barratts does not seek to collect Personal Information about children through its website and is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors under the age of 18. Parents should supervise the online activities of their children, and consider the use of tools available from online services and software providers that help provide kid-friendly Internet environments.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Other Sites</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Barratts website may contain links to other sites on the Web. The information practices of those websites are not covered by this privacy policy. Although we are committed to protecting your Personal Information, we cannot control and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other websites. Barratts encourages you to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personal information. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and other account information.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Modifications of this policy</font></p>
<p><font size="2">We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are responsible for checking this policy when you visit our site to review the current policy. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we are going to use your Personal Information different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via e-mail. You will have a choice as to whether or not you want us to use your Personal Information in this different manner.<br><br></font></p></span>
