<p><b>7. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION</b></p>
<p><b>Updates to Privacy Policy</b>. Dow Jones may modify this Privacy Policy. Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Dow Jones Online Services. Your use of the Dow Jones Online Services or your provision of personal information to us following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><b>Do Not Track Disclosure. </b>Some browsers or other tools include âDo Not Trackâ (DNT) features which, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time.&nbsp; The Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups and regulators to develop a DNT browser technology standard to provide a common understanding as to how to interpret the DNT signals, but to date no standard has been adopted. Since there is no standard at this time, Dow Jones does not currently respond to DNT signals.&nbsp; Dow Jones will follow the progress of the W3C in developing the standard.</p>
<p><b>Location of Data</b>. Your Personal Information may be stored, transferred to, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using our products and services, you consent to the processing and transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have different data protection rules than in your country.</p>
<p><b>Data Retention</b>. We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.</p>
<p><b>Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service</b>. In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (âPayment Serviceâ). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment in such a case, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Serviceâs privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Serviceâs use of information collected through any Payment Service.</p>
<p><b>Linked Services</b>. The Dow Jones Online Services may also be linked to sites operated by third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, special offers, functionality, games or applications developed and maintained by third parties. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a Dow Jones logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. For example:</p>
<ul style="font-size: 14px;">
<li>A portion of The Wall Street Journal Archive is hosted by an unrelated company â ProQuest â through its ProQuest Archiver service, and all article purchases are processed by ProQuest. ProQuest collects and uses your information in accordance with its privacy policy, and makes your information available to us. We will treat all information that ProQuest provides about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>The Portfolio feature is provided by a third party, NextCapital. NextCapital collects and uses your information in accordance with its privacy policy, which is separate from this one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dow Jones is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you leave the Dow Jones Online Services or click an advertisement, or sign up for a special offer, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the other service.</p>
