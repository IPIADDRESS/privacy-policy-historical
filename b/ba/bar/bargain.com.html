		<hr>
		EFFECTIVE DATE: September 27, 2004<br>

		This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Bargain Network does not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage.
		<hr>
		<h3 class="textBlue">Information Collection and Use</h3>
		Information collected by Bargain Network is stored in a single, secure database, accessible only by BNI. Bargain Network collects information from our paying members (members) or other persons who use, attempt to use, or access Bargain Network or the Services (users) at several different points and from different sources, all or some of which may apply to you:
		<ol>

			&nbsp;</li>
		<li><strong>Information from Other Sources</strong> <br>
			for reasons such as improving personalization of our Service (for example, providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you), we might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.
