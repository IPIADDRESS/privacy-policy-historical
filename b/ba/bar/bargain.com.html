			<br>
			<div class="lineHorizontal-Alt2">&nbsp;</div>
			<p>This Privacy Policy (Policy) discloses the practices of Bargain Network concerning personal information we obtain about you. By using Bargain Network, in any way accessing Bargain.com, or using other services of Bargain Network (collectively the Services), you are accepting the practices described in this Policy.</p>
			<p>This Policy notifies you of: (a) what personal information of yours is collected when you access Bargain.com and/or use the Services; (b) how the information is collected; (c) how the information is used and shared; (d) our efforts to maintain the security of Sensitive Information; and (e) other details concerning your personal information and our policies.</p>
			<p>This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Bargain Network does not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage.</p>
	
			<p><span class="bodyTextSectionHeader">Information Collection and Use</span>
			<br>
			</p><div class="lineHorizontal-Alt2">&nbsp;</div>
			Information collected by Bargain Network is stored in a single, secure database, accessible only by Bargain Network. Bargain Network collects information from our paying members (members) or other persons who use, attempt to use, or access Bargain Network or the Services (users) at several different points and from different sources, all or some of which may apply to you:
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bodyTextEmphasis">Registration</span>
				<br>
				When you sign up to be a member or potential member of the Services, we ask for, and you are required to give, your name, address, zip code, telephone number, email address, credit card or checking account number, and credit card expiration date. Once you register with us, you are not anonymous to us.</li>
				<br>&nbsp;
				
				<li><span class="bodyTextEmphasis">Cookies</span>
				<br>
				Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computers hard drive through your Web browser.</li>
				<br>&nbsp;
				
				<li><span class="bodyTextEmphasis">Log Files</span>
				<br>
				Bargain.com automatically receives and records information on its server logs from your Web browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. We use IP addresses and cookies to analyze trends, administer the site, track members and users movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to your personal information.</li>
				<br>&nbsp;
				
				<li><span class="bodyTextEmphasis">Information from Other Sources</span>
				<br>
				For reasons such as improving personalization of our Service (for example, providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you), we might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.</li>
			</ul><p></p>
			
			<p><span class="bodyTextSectionHeader">Use of Information </span>
			<br>
			</p><div class="lineHorizontal-Alt2">&nbsp;</div>
			Information we collect is generally used for the following purposes:
			<ol>			
				<li>To build features that will make the services available on our site easier to use. This includes faster search requests, better customer support and timely notice of new services and special offers.</li>
				<br>&nbsp;
				
				<li>To improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our sites content, layout, and services. These uses improve our Services and better tailor them to meet your needs.</li>
				<br>&nbsp;
				
				<li>To resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms and Conditions of Use. At times, we may look across multiple members or users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine your information to identify members using multiple Member Ids or aliases.</li>
				<br>&nbsp;
				
				<li>Except as otherwise provided herein, the information we collect from you is shared with our marketing partners or other third parties so that we may offer you other products or services that we think could be of interest to you. For example, Bargain Network may sell or rent aggregated statistical information and user, member or former member specific information, including name, address, telephone number and payment information, to our marketing partners or other third-parties. If you do not wish for Bargain Network to share information it has about you with anyone, you may notify us of this fact by contacting Bargain Networks Member services department at 1-800-300-6140.</li>
