www.bargaineering.com and its owner (“we,” “us,” or “our”) take your privacy seriously, and have published this Privacy Policy to explain how we will treat information that you may submit to www.bargaineering.com or to portions of other Web pages and Web content through which you have accessed this Privacy Policy (collectively, this “Site”).  By visiting, using and/or submitting information to the Site you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy and the terms and conditions of the Agreement of Terms of Use located at the URL [http://www.bargaineering.com/articles/terms-of-use] (the “Terms of Use”).<p></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to information which is submitted pursuant to a sweepstakes entry.  Refer to the Official Rules and Privacy Policy for each individual sweepstakes for specific policies regarding information sharing and disclosure pursuant to a sweepstakes entry. </p>
<p><strong>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
Many of the features of this Site are available to you without your providing personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information generally includes information that could be used to determine your identity, such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and birth date. The following are certain situations in which we may collect personally identifiable information from you:<br>
•	General Registration.  We collect personally identifiable information from you, such as your e-mail address and first name, if you register with this Site.  The benefits of registration may include things such as the ability to collect points that may be redeemed at our store, as further described on the Site from time to time.<br>
•	Registration for Newsletters and Sweepstakes. We collect personally identifiable information from you if you register online for one of our newsletters and when you enter our sweepstakes. When you register online with us, we may ask for personally identifiable information such as your name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, ZIP code, occupation, industry, personal interests and other demographic information.<br>
•	Comments; Use of Forums. If you would like to post a comment or otherwise transmit, submit or post information through our blog, chat rooms, bulletin boards or other forums (the “Forums”), we will collect that information you provide. Specifically, we will require that you provide, and collect from you, personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, if you would like to post a comment or otherwise transmit, submit or post information through our Forums.  We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law and pursuant to the Terms of Use.<br>
•	Registration for RSS Feed.  We may collect personally identifiable information from you if you choose to receive RSS feeds from us.  For example, if you would like to receive RSS feeds from us via e-mail, we will collect your e-mail address to provide you with RSS feeds at the e-mail address that you provide.<br>
•	Forms. We may collect personally identifiable information from you if you choose to fill out any forms, profiles, or surveys on this Site.<br>
•	Correspondence.  If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on this Site, we may choose to collect such information into a file specific to you.<br>
•	Business Partners. We may receive your personally identifiable information from one of our business partners. </p>
<p><strong>Use of Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
We use your personally identifiable information as follows:<br>
•	to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our content, layout, and services;<br>
•	to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of this Site;<br>
•	to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, such as to send you requested newsletters or to deliver items redeemed from our store;<br>
•	for market research, project planning, troubleshooting problems, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity, to enforce the Terms of Use, for other internal purposes, and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection; and<br>
•	as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>You expressly agree to our use of your personally identifiable information as set forth in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. </p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
The following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business:<br>
•	Advertisers. We may aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. For example, we may aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose it to network advertisers in a non-personally identifiable manner as set forth in the section entitled “Network Advertisers,” set forth below. We do not disclose your information in a personally identifiable manner to such third party advertisers without your consent.<br>
•	External Service Providers. There are a number of separate services offered by third parties, including, without limitation, our affiliates, that we refer to as external service providers that may be complementary to your use of this Site.  If you choose to use these separate services, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy. With your consent, we may provide some of your personal information to the external service provider offering such services, for your convenience. To prevent our disclosure of your personally identifiable information to an external service provider, you can decline such consent or simply not use their services. You should evaluate the practices of external services providers before deciding to use their services. </p>
<p><strong>NOTE:  If you click to use or apply for a service or product on this Site, you may be linked to an external service provider’s Web site.  If you choose to use or apply for an external service provider’s service or product, then all information you disclose will be governed by the external service provider’s privacy policy.  Such links to external service providers are not an endorsement by us of those external service providers and/or the products or services offered there.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices of external service providers and encourage you to check the privacy policy of external service providers.</strong></p>
<p>•	Internal Service Providers. We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of our business, product and service operations that we provide to you (e.g., technology, Forums, newsletters/alerts, analytical tools, advertising campaign management) and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers. These internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us or other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information that we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. In some instances, the internal service provider may collect information directly from you. In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your personally identifiable information is governed by their applicable privacy policy. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right (and you authorize us) to share or disclose your personally identifiable information when we determine, in our sole discretion, that the disclosure of your personally identifiable information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you if:<br>
•	you are or may be violating this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use;<br>
•	you are interfering with another’s rights or property, including, without limitation, our rights or property;<br>
•	you are violating any applicable law, rule or regulation;<br>
•	necessary or required by any applicable law, rule or regulation; and/or<br>
•	requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or instance of local, regional or national emergency. </p>
<p>Personally identifiable information and other personal information collected from you may also be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger, reorganization, other transfer or bankruptcy (a “Transfer”) involving us and/or our affiliates. We specifically reserve the right to transfer personally identifiable information collected from this Site, and any of our databases, together with any personally identifiable information contained therein, to a third party in connection with a Transfer, and nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our business and/or assets (including this Site) to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever.</p>
<p>In addition, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are submitting personally identifiable information pursuant to sweepstakes entry, we reserve the right to share, loan, rent and/or sell the personally identifiable information that you submit with our affiliates and other third parties. Please refer to the Official Rules and Privacy Policy for each individual sweepstakes for the specific guidelines regarding information sharing and disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Network Advertising</strong><br>
We may use third-party advertising companies for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to you. Using third-party advertising companies helps us and third-party advertisers better determine which advertisements or content to serve to you. For example, the third-party advertisers may use information regarding your visits to this Site and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services, that third party advertisers believe will be of interest to you.<br>
The types of information that may be collected by third-party advertising companies include the following:<br>
•	the type of Internet browser you use;<br>
•	the type of computer operating system you use;<br>
•	the domain name of a Web site you visit, as well as information related to Web sites and Web pages you are viewing when an advertisement is requested;<br>
•	whether or not you visit specific pages of this Site or other Web sites;<br>
•	the location of your Internet service provider’s point of presence;<br>
•	the date and time of a visit to a Web site;<br>
•	search keywords passed from another server;<br>
•	the number of times you have clicked on an advertisement; and<br>
•	other interactions between you and a Web site. </p>
<p>If you would like to opt-out of third-party advertising companies’ use of such information, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">click here</a>. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/">click here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Opt-Out and Changes to Personally Identifiable Information and Use Preferences </strong><br>
You may at any time request a copy of our record of your personally identifiable information, change your personally identifiable information or use preferences, or opt-out of our use of your personally identifiable information by contacting us at privacy@bargaineering.com.</p>
<p>If you would like to opt-out of third-party advertising companies’ use of your information for the network advertising purposes described above, click here.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletters and CAN-SPAM Compliance</strong><br>
We send only verified, double-opt-in e-mail newsletters, specifically requested by our subscribers. Subscriptions to our newsletters are verified by sending an e-mail confirmation to your e-mail address, which requires a positive response before an e-mail address is added to our list. We are fully compliant with the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003.  We are not responsible for any email communications that you may receive from third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie technology</strong><br>
“Cookies” are alphanumeric identifiers in the form of text files that are inserted and stored by your Web browser on your computer’s hard drive. We, our external service providers, internal service providers, and third-party advertising companies, may set and access cookies on your computer to track and store preferential information about you. We, and our external service providers, internal service providers, and third-party advertising companies gather anonymous information about you through cookie technology on an aggregate level only. For example, a third-party advertising company may assign a cookie (and a Web beacon, described below) to you, to limit the amount of times you see a particular advertisement or to help better determine which advertisements to serve to you.  Please note that most Internet browsers will allow you to stop cookies from being stored on your computer and to delete cookies stored on your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Web beacons</strong><br>
”Web beacons”, also called single-pixels (1×1) or clear GIFs, are electronic images that allow a Web site to access cookies and help track marketing campaigns and general usage patterns of visitors to those Web sites. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information, such as cookie numbers, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. No personally identifiable information about you is shared with third parties through the use of Web beacons.<br>
•	Internal use of Web beacons. We may use Web beacons internally to count users and recognize users through cookies. Access to cookies helps us personalize your experience when you visit this Site.<br>
•	Email. We may include Web beacons in HTML-formatted email messages that we or our affiliates or agents send. Including Web beacons in email messages helps us determine your interest in and the effectiveness of such emails.<br>
•	External use of Web beacons. We may also use Web beacons externally. For example, we may report aggregate information about our users, such as demographic and usage information, to our partners and other third parties. We may also include other company’s Web beacons within the Site.  </p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
Personally identifiable information you submit to us is password-protected for your privacy and security. In certain areas we use industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions. In the unlikely event that an unauthorized third party compromises our security measures, we will not be responsible for any damages directly or indirectly caused by an unauthorized third party’s ability to view, use or disseminate such information.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Web sites</strong><br>
This Site may include links to other third party Web sites. Such links are not an endorsement by us of those Web sites and/or the products or services offered there. Third party Web sites may have different privacy policies and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third party Web sites. If you click on a link to a third party Web site, we encourage you to check the privacy policy of that Web site, as it may differ substantially from that of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Access and Use of this Site</strong><br>
This Site is intended to be accessed and used only by adults and is not directed to children under the age of 18.  We do not knowingly permit registration or submission of personally identifiable information by anyone under the age of 18.</p>

Any information we collect from you online is subject only to our most current Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to revisit this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to review any changes that have been made. Your continued access and use of this Site following the posting of any such changes shall automatically be deemed your acceptance of the same.</p>

If you have questions, comments, concerns or feedback regarding this Privacy Policy, send an e-mail to privacy@bargaineering.com.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law; Arbitration</strong><br>
You agree that: (i) this Site shall be deemed solely based in the State of Florida; and (ii) this Site shall be deemed a passive Web site that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than the State of Florida.  This Privacy Policy is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Florida, without regard for principles of conflicts of laws. Any civil action, claim, dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Privacy Policy shall be referred to final and binding arbitration, before a single arbitrator, under the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association in Palm Beach County, Florida. </p>
<p>THEREFORE, YOU DO NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS AND YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OR BRING CLASS ACTIONS. BY USING THIS SITE YOU CONSENT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS.</p>
<p>You and us shall select the arbitrator, and if you and us are unable to reach agreement on selection of the arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the notice of arbitration is served, then the American Arbitration Association shall select the arbitrator. Arbitration shall not commence until the party requesting it has deposited One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) with the arbitrator for the arbitrator’s fees and costs. The party requesting arbitration shall advance such sums as are required from time to time by the arbitrator to pay the arbitrator’s fees and costs until the prevailing party is determined or the parties have agreed in writing to an alternate allocation of fees and costs.<br>
Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive upon you and us and your and our respective administrators, executors, legal representatives, successors and assigns, and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in no event shall either you or we be entitled to punitive, special, indirect or consequential damages and both you and we hereby waive your and our respective rights to any punitive, special, indirect or consequential damages, including, but not limited to, damages for any loss of profit, revenue or business.</p>
<p>Should a dispute arise and should the arbitration provisions herein become inapplicable or unenforceable, or in any instance of any lawsuit between you and us, jurisdiction over and venue of any suit shall be exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting in Palm Beach County, Florida.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><br>
If any portion of this Privacy Policy is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable by any arbitrator, this Privacy Policy as a whole shall not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of this Privacy Policy that is unlawful, void or unenforceable shall be stricken from this Privacy Policy.<br>
The headings contained in this Privacy Policy are for convenience of reference only, are not to be considered a part of this Privacy Policy, and shall not limit or otherwise affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Privacy Policy.<br>
All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made in this Privacy Policy, as may be amended by us from time to time, shall survive your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use represent the entire understanding and agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter of the same, and supersede all other previous agreements, understandings and/or representations regarding the same.</p>
