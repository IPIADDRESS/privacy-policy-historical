<br>
<p>

</p>
<br>
<h2>1. What data are stored?</h2>
<h3>1.1. Personal Data</h3>
<p>When you register, we collect and store basic information such as your name, address, email address and other contact information such as username and password. You may provide us with additional information on the site (e.g. if you complete your profile) or if you communicate with us.</p><p>
</p><p>The following registration data will be available for other users:</p>
<ul>
<li>First name</li>
<li>Last name</li>
<li>Screen name</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.2. Cookies</h3>
<p>After your login with user name and password, Babbel uses cookies to identify you during the course of your session. A cookie will be stored on your computer. Upon the termination of your session the session cookie will  automatically be deleted. A persistant cookie stores your flash version number anonymously. On login, you can save another persistent cookie that contains your encrypted login information and is stored locally. This is done by the option "remember me".</p>

<h3>1.3. Log Files</h3>
<p>Each time you access Babbel, the following data will be stored in the server log file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your IP address (by which your computer can be clearly identified)</li>
<li>The name and IP address of the computer requesting the respective page from the Babbel web servers (the so called "remote host computer")</li>
<li>The time, status, and amount of the transferred data, as well as the Internet website from which you have reached the requested page of the Babbel web servers (the so called "referrer")</li>
<li>The product and release information from your Internet browser (the so called "user agent").</li>
</ul>
<p>This log file will be stored by Lesson Nine in the standardized "combined" log file format for the LightTpd Web server. Lesson Nine uses the data from this log file in anonymous form without reference to your person just for statistical purposes. In doing so, Lesson Nine may analyze on which days and at which time the Babbel services are particularly frequented and how much data volume is created on the Babbel web servers. Furthermore, by using the log file, Lesson Nine can identify defects on Babbel, such as defective hyperlinks or program defects, and thus continually improve the quality of Babbel. Lesson Nine does not attribute the website requests stored in the log file to specific individual users. However, Lesson Nine reserves the right to review the log files from the last known IP address of a Babbel member if Lesson Nine has reasonable cause to believe that the member is using Babbel in breach of contractual agreements or the applicable legislation.</p>

<h3>1.4. Google Analytics</h3>
<p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States .

<h3>1.7. Messages</h3>
<p>All messages, chats and other contacts between Babbel users who make use of the Babbel community tools are stored on the Babbel webservers. This private information will not be made accessible to others by any means.</p>
