<p>SheKnows, LLC ("Company," "we," or "us") knows that you care how
information about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains
what information of yours will be collected by Company when you use
SheKnows.com and related services (the "Service"), how the information
will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or
deletion of information. We will not use or share your information with
anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p><strong>User-Provided  Information: </strong> You provide us
information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, when
you register with the Service. If you correspond with us by email, we
may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and
our responses. </p>
<p><strong>Cookies Information: </strong>When you visit SheKnows.com,
we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string
of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies
your browser and lets Company help you log in faster and enhance your
navigation through the site. A cookie does not collect personal
information about you. Company uses both session cookies and persistent
cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close
your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on
subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by
following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary
and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web
browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being
sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly
if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Log File Information: </strong>Log file information is
automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page.
When you register with or view our site, our servers automatically
record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you
visit any website. These server logs may include information such as
your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type,
referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names,
landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Gifs  Information: </strong> When you use the Service,
we may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track
the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personally
identifiable information from your Company account is collected using
these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based
emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by
recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting,
improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make us better for our
users.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and
provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. </p>
<p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose
for posting to the Service (for instance, in User Content you post)
becomes available to the public. If you remove User Content, copies may
remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have
copied or stored your User Content.</p>
<p>By providing Company your email address you consent to our using the
email address to send you Service-related notices, including any
notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We
may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as
newsletters, changes to features of the Service, or special offers. If
you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by
sending an email message to

<p>Company may use certain information about you and/or your User
Content without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We
do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used,
diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and
personalizing advertisements and promotions.</p>
<p>Company reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the
User Content you post on the site. Company has the right to remove any
such information or material for any reason or no reason, including
without limitation, if in its sole opinion, such information or
material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of
Use Agreement or to protect or defend its rights or property or those
of any third party. Company also reserves the right to remove
information upon the request of any third party.</p>
<p>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a)
remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during
your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom,
personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of
our service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of
visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported
by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses
controlled by a specific web company or ISP; and (f) help you
efficiently access your information after you sign in.</p>
<p><strong>How We Share Your Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information: </strong>Company will
not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others.
Company may share your personally identifiable information with third
parties solely for the purpose of providing services to you. If we do
this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this
Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside
the direct control of Company (for instance, on servers or databases
co-located with hosting providers).</p>
<p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business
offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of
the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may
also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures,
mergers, or dissolution. </p>
<p>Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, Company
will not disclose personal information to any third party unless
required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action
is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process
served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action
regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our
Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and
defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to
assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or
integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights,
property, or personal safety of Company, our users or others.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information: </strong>We may
share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage
data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks,
etc. ) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage
patterns for certain Company services.</p>
<p>Company allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad
networks, to serve advertisements on the Company site. These
third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly
to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on Company.
They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may
also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web
Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to
personalize the advertising content.</p>
<p>Company does not provide any personally identifiable information to
these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent.
However, please note that if an advertiser asks Company to show an
advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that
advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit
the description of the audience they are trying to reach. </p>
<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these
third-party ad servers or ad networks. The Company privacy policy does
not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such
advertisers. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>How We Protect Your  Information</strong></p>
<p>Company uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and
technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your
personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the
security of any information you transmit to Company and you do so at
your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information,
Company makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of
our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that
such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed
by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. </p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such
as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before
granting you access to your account. You are responsible for
maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account
information, and for controlling access to your email communications
from Company, at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Compromise of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of
a breach of security, Company will promptly notify those persons whose
personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the
notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as
otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>Your Choices About Your Information</strong></p>
<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable
information through Company, in which case Company may not be able to
provide certain services to you. </p>
<p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.
For that reason, Company does not knowingly collect or solicit personal
information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such
persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not send any
information about yourself to us, including your name, address,
telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to
provide any personal information to or on Company. In the event that we
learn that we have collected personal information from a child under
age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that
information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have
any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at
