                </p><ul class="tw-list-disc tw-pl-12">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access
                        request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to
                        check that we are lawfully processing it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables
                        you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to
                        verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Request erasure </strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or
                        remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also
                        have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully
                        exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your
                        information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local
                        law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for
                        specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your
                        request.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Object to processing </strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a
                        legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular
                        situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on
                        your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing
                        your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
                        compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and
                        freedoms.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to
                        ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you
                        want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do
                        not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it
                        as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our
                        use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will
                        provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly
                        used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which
                        you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a
                        contract with you.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your
                        personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before
                        you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain
                        products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw
                        your consent.
