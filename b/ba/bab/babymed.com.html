						<h3 align="center">BabyMed Privacy Statement</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p align="justify"><b>BabyMed Respects Your Privacy</b><br>BabyMed respects your online privacy and takes it seriously. We pledge to earn and keep your trust and we are fully committed to ensuring that your privacy is respected and protected. All personal information you give us is maintained in accordance with our privacy policy and will not be used in ways that are contrary to that policy. This Privacy Policy covers all web sites and web pages owned, controlled and/or operated by BabyMed.com, specifically including but not limited to BabyMed.com. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p align="justify"><b>Information Collected</b><br>Information collected by BabyMed about its users is used internally by authorized employees of BabyMed and its affiliates for three main purposes: a. We collect information to figure out which areas, features, and products our users like the most and find most helpful, so we can continue to improve the site. B. We collect information in order to personalize the site for our users (for example, it allows us to recommend products or features based on what you have liked in the past). c. We may collect information to enable our users to participate in sweepstakes, contests, services, and other activities on our site. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p align="justify"><b>Personal Data</b><br>On occasion, BabyMed may also share non-personal, summary data about our users with unrelated third parties (for example, we publicly disclose how many people have signed up for BabyMed membership). However, BabyMed will not share personally identifiable data about any particular user with unrelated third parties unless the user has specifically agreed to sharing it. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p align="justify"><b>Membership</b><br>Many areas of BabyMed are reserved for BabyMed members who have registered with us; for example, chats, message boards and access to special services such as My BabyMed, special offers and sweepstakes. BabyMed will not share personally identifiable data about any particular user with unrelated third parties unless the user has specifically agreed to sharing it in the registration form ("Make Public"). BabyMed provides you with the ability to access, correct or change certain information in your member profile at any time, including contact information or other information you've provided to us. Please be advised that BabyMed currently archives information it collects on its members and visitors. BabyMed can revoke membership in BabyMed at any time and without notice. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p align="justify"><b>Advertising</b><br>BabyMed may also use certain third-party advertising services to display advertising. These third-party services may place a cookie on your computer for the purposes of ad tracking and presentation. (See "Cookies and IP Addresses," below, if you're not sure what a cookie is.) BabyMed does not share personally identifiable information about users with advertising service. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p align="justify"><b>For Adults</b><br>BabyMed is designed for adults and BabyMed generally doesn't collect personal information about babies and children other than from their parents, and we won't collect personal information about babies or children without first getting their parents' consent. After giving consent, parents will also have the option of reviewing, changing, or deleting a child's personal information, revoking the consent, or refusing to permit collection of further information. We ask that our users not provide information about a baby or child without first getting the parents' consent. Examples of personal information include full name, home address, e-mail address, and phone number. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p align="justify"><b>Cookies and IP Addresses</b><br>We do not and cannot use cookies or IP address tracking to retrieve personal information from your computer. To find out what cookies and IP addresses are, keep reading. <br><br>Cookies: At times we send your computer a "cookie," a small data file that's stored on your hard drive. We use cookies to give you better, more personalized service once you've bought something from us or become a member of BabyMed. This information is for internal use only; we don't share it with others. You're always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly for you if you do. <br><br>Note: You may see advertising on our site that originates from outside advertisers and/or advertising agencies. In some cases, if you click on or view these ads, the advertiser will assign a cookie. BabyMed does not control these cookies. <br><br>IP address tracking: All computers and servers on the Internet use IP addresses to recognize and communicate with each other. Collecting IP addresses allows us to administer and analyze our site and report non-personal information (such as how many 
								visitors we get) to sponsors and advertisers. When you call up a BabyMed page on your computer, BabyMed's servers enter the IP address of that computer into a log. To maintain our users' anonymity, BabyMed does not associate IP addresses with records containing personal information.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p align="justify"><b>Other Parties</b><br>Please note that if you provide any information on your own or directly to parties who provide service to our network or to Internet sites other than BabyMed (even if these sites display the BabyMed name and logo in addition to their own), different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of any personal information you might give them. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to third parties. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p align="justify"><b>Online Surveys And Contests </b><br>Sometimes we conduct user surveys to find out how we can improve our site for you. We may share non-personal information about our users with partners or other third parties. For example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of our users are female. But we will not sell personal information to or share any personal information with an unrelated third party without your consent. Sometimes we and our sponsors offer contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information. For example, a sponsor might require your name and e-mail address to participate in a contest. Because the rules and terms of each promotion can vary, all information about the contest is posted during the event, and those disclosures shall override anything to the contrary in this policy. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p align="justify"><b>General Security</b><br>Your credit card, your personal information, and your password are safe. We use the latest encryption technologies, rigorous password protections, and limits on the number of people who have access to your information, all to guard against unauthorized access to your data. As a member of BabyMed, you can review and change the information in your Member Profile at any time.&nbsp; </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p align="justify"><b>Changes</b><br>BabyMed may modify this privacy policy at any time, and such modifications shall be effective as soon as the modified policy is posted. Accordingly, you agree to review the policy periodically, and your continued access or use of this site shall be deemed your acceptance of the modified agreement. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p align="justify"><b>Limits On Our Abilities</b><br>Although your privacy is very important to us, in the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personal information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, under certain circumstances the government or unrelated third parties might force us to disclose information to them, or third parties might unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, in the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can (and you authorize us to do so) disclose any information about you to private entities and law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p align="justify"><b>Security For Personal Information</b><br>BabyMed won't intentionally collect any personally identifiable information about you except when you specifically provide us with it. For example, if you become a member of BabyMed to take advantage of certain features such as the fertility notifications, we ask for your e-mail address. When you sign up for BabyMed membership, you can also sign up to receive promotional offers and information from BabyMed and other qualified merchants. These qualified merchants are prescreened organizations or companies whose products or services we believe are of interest to parents and parents-to-be. But if you don't want to receive these offers, simply uncheck the Additional Offers box as you sign up. If you sign up to receive the offers but later decide you don't want them, go to your Member Profile page, where you can unsubscribe by un-checking the appropriate boxes. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p align="justify"><b>Third Parties</b><br>We won't sell or disclose your personally identifiable information to unrelated third parties without your consent. However, on particular pages where we ask for your personal information, we may explicitly tell you that the data we're collecting on that page might be shared with third parties, such as our sponsors or parties providing services to our users. In such cases, those disclosures shall override anything to the contrary in this policy. For example, before you submit answers to questions we ask in an advertiser-sponsored promotion or service, we'll tell you that your answers might be shared with that advertiser. In all of these cases, we'll collect personally identifiable information only if you voluntarily submit it to us or our sponsors. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p align="justify"><b>Chat Rooms And Boards</b><br>Our site also has public areas such as chat rooms and message boards. Please remember that any information you share in these areas becomes public, so you should be careful about what you disclose. Any posts or comments made on our boards become the property of BabyMed and BabyMed can use and publish any posts made on our boards. BabyMed can remove any posts it deems unacceptable at any time without having to notify you first. By using our Web site, you consent to our <a href="tos.asp">Terms of Service</a>. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p align="justify"><b>Your Questions And Comments</b><br>Feel free to contact us, with comments or questions. See About Us to find out more about our company and our policies. </p>
