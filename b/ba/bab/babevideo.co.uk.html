<p style="font-size:22px">(C)      Cookies</p>

<p>A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web 
browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to
 the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This 
enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.</p>

<p>Like most websites, this website uses cookies and all visitors to the 
site are advised of our use of cookies when first arriving on the 
website.</p>

<p>The site uses two types of cookies, session cookies and persistent

tracking and reporting of website traffic or website performance, such 
as those used by Google Analytics and similar tools.</p>

blocking all cookies in this way will make it impossible for site
 members to login to their accounts.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p style="font-size:22px">(D)      Data Collection</p>

<p>Babe Video collects both personal data and aggregated data.</p>

<p>Personal data, or personal information, refers to any information 
about an individual from which that person could be identified.</p>

<p>On this website we collect and store the following kinds of personal information:</p>

<p>(1) the email address that you provide to us for the purpose of 
registering with us. You can access the email address we 
hold for you in your account management options and amend it at any time.</p>

<p>(2) information about your visits to and use of the site, such as 
your IP address including therefore your internet service provider and 
your geographical location, your browser type and version, your computer
 operating system, your referral source, the length of your visit, your 
page views and your forum navigation.</p>

<p>(3) any other information that you choose to provide, such as 
personal information revealed through your username, avatar, profile, 
media uploads, site comments, private messages and emails. You must have a username to register an account, but you are not required to enter any profile details in order to use the site.</p>

<p>Aggregated data refers to statistical data which is used to better 
understand how our visitors are using the site and to improve site 
performance. On many websites aggregated data is derived from personal 
data, but the aggregated data we collect on this site is not derived 
from personal data and could not be used to reveal your identity, either
 directly or indirectly.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p style="font-size:22px">(E)      Data Use</p>

<p>Information that we collect from you is stored and processed in the USA which 
is the country in which the site is located. You expressly agree to 
this.</p>

<p>We may use the personal information we collect from you to:</p>

<p>(1) administer the site, which means sending you newsletters, service messages and policy updates from the site admin.</p>

<p>(2) improve your user experience by personalising the site.</p>

<p>(3) deal with enquiries and complaints made by or about you regarding the use or operation of the site.</p>

<p>If you prefer not to have your personal data used as described above you should not join the site. You are always welcome to view
 the site as a guest and are not obliged to register as a member. Most 
of our site visitors are guests and not members.</p>

<p>If you are registered as a member, please be aware that your username
 and any additional content you provide through your member profile, your media uploads or comments that you contribute to the site are fully visible not only to other members but to anyone visiting the site as a guest.</p>
 
 <p>We will not under any circumstances provide your email address to any
 third parties for the purpose of direct marketing or for any other 
commercial purpose.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p style="font-size:22px">(F)      Site Comments</p>

<p>Please note that if you post personal information in comments you contribute to the site you do so at your own risk, including the risk of abandoning any privacy rights you had in such information (as we are obviously unable to prevent the use or misuse of such information by others once you have published it on the worldwide web).

</p><p>However, please note that personal information posted in site comments may be regarded as inappropriate and removed by site staff. In particular any email addresses and telephone numbers which are posted in comments are likely to be removed.</p>

<p>Regarding any comments you contribute here, you agree to grant to the site a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual license to have the comments visible on the site and to reproduce, distribute, transmit and create derivative works of them, without any right of rescission whatsoever. This means that you cannot revoke permission for UK Babe Channels to publish and to allow others to have derivative rights to content once you have yourself made it public, and you should be aware that in any event UK Babe Channels loses direct control over such content when it is published on the open internet. You also agree that you shall have no recourse against the site for any alleged or actual infringement or misappropriation of any proprietary right in your comments.</p>

<p>If a comment made by another member includes information that could be considered invasive of your privacy it is likely to be removed. If not you are free to contact us and ask for the relevant material to be removed. We take no responsibility for the content of messages posted, other than to remove them from the site where considered appropriate, and we cannot be held liable for the content of any messages posted.</p>

<p>Comments may contain links to other websites. We have no control over such third party websites and have no responsibility for their privacy policies or their practices.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p style="font-size:22px">(G)      Data Security</p>

<p>Babe Video is committed to protecting your privacy by storing 
your data securely and by regularly testing our security measures. We 
have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security 
breach.</p>

<p>All the data you provide us with is stored securely without any 
exceptions and we will take all reasonable technical and operational measures to prevent the disclosure of your registration email address and any other 
email address that you subsequently use. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, no transmission of data over the internet can
 be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, and despite our efforts, 
we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us 
and have no responsibility or liability for the security of information 
transmitted via the internet, including any act of hacking in which your
 data is compromised.</p>

<p>You play an important role in keeping your information secure, as you
 are responsible for choosing your password and keeping it confidential.
 Please use a strong password in order to protect your account and guard
 it carefully. You can change your password at any time in your account management options.</p>

<p>Please note that if your account is hacked the hacker will have
 access to your stored email address. The importance of account security
 cannot be over-emphasised, as with access to your account the hacker 
will also be able to impersonate you on the site. Again, you can change
 your password at any time in your account management options .</p>

<p>If you forget your password, you can use the "lost password" option, which requires you to submit your email address in order to have a new password generated. Please note that if your registered email address is no longer valid you will not be able to reset your password in this way.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p style="font-size:22px">(H)      Data Disclosure</p>

<p>If you take part in a site competition and win a prize, it may be necessary to provide some personal information of yours to the sponsor of the competition in order that the prize can be awarded to you. This would depend on your express consent being sought and given at the time.</p>

<p>In addition we may disclose information about you to to the extent that we are required to do so by law, in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings or to provide the information to anyone who we believe may successfully apply to a court for the disclosure of the information.</p>

<p>We will not under any circumstances provide any of your personal 
information to a third party for the purpose of direct marketing or for 
any other commercial purpose.</p>

<p>If you disclose personal information yourself by posting it in comments you contribute to the site you do so at your own risk, as mentioned in section (F) above.</p>

<p>Personal information may also be passed to other members by using the
 site's private message system. As private messages are private they are not visible to the public or to members of the site other than those a specific message was sent to. </p>

<p>If you disclose personal information about yourself by private 
message you do so at your own risk, as you are dependent upon 
the recipient respecting your privacy. </p>

<p>All information that we hold is stored and processed in the USA which
 is the country in which the site is located. We will not transfer any 
of your personal information to any other country without your express 
consent being sought and given at the time.
