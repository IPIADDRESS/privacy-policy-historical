    <h4>Baby List, Inc.</h4>

    <p>Effective Date: June 2, 2015</p>

    <h4>PRIVACY POLICY</h4>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information
      will be collected by Baby List, Inc. (“Baby List,”
      “we,” “us,” or “our”) when you access our
      Website, software, applications, products or related services (collectively,
      the “Service”) and how the information will be used. We will not
      use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy
      Policy. &nbsp;Each time you use our Service you are accepting the practices
      described in this Privacy Policy at that time.
    </p>


    <h4>Definitions</h4>


    <p>This Privacy Policy uses certain capitalized
      terms that have particular meanings. Sometimes, those terms are defined when
      they are first used. In addition, and for ease of reference, the following
      terms are defined in this section:
    </p>


    <ul>
      <li>“<u>App</u>” means any Baby List
        software application, including, but not limited to, the Baby List Android
        and/or iPad and/or iPhone software application.
      </li>

      <li>“<u>Browsing Information</u>” means
        information about your use of the Service, or your computer’s (or
        other access device, such as an iPad or smartphone) interaction with the
        Service. Browsing Information also includes certain of the information
        described in the “Information Collected Automatically” section
        below. &nbsp;This information is linked to a device identifier, such as the
        Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer or device. &nbsp;The App
        transmits information to us that we use to provide our services, assist you
        in troubleshooting, and improve our products, services, Website and App.
        &nbsp;In general, Baby List does not use Browsing Information to identify
        you, but such information may be paired with Personal Information, or with
        other information that together, could be used to identify you.
        Additionally, third parties, such as analytics companies and advertising
        service providers may access, collect, store, and use Browsing Information,
        and they may use it to identify you. &nbsp;
      </li>

      <li>“<u>Personal Information</u>” means
        information that directly identifies you, or that can directly identify
        you, such as your shipping and/or billing address, e-mail address, phone
        number, credit card information and/or your baby’s name and/or
        expected birth
        date.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      </li>


      <li>“<u>Website</u>” means any websites,
        web pages, and any subpages (including mobile websites, web pages and
        subpages) under Baby List’s control, whether partial or otherwise.
        This includes but is not limited to
        www.babyli.st, any subpages, and the website
        from which these terms of use were accessed from.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h4>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>


    <p><u>Personal Information We Affirmatively
      Collect From You</u>
    </p>


    <p>We may collect Personal Information about you,
      such as your first and last name, phone number, email address, physical
      address or credit card information, through our Service when (i) you register
      for an account on our Website or App, (ii) you sign up for our newsletter,
      (iii) you order from our Website or App, or (iv) you include Personal
      Information in User Content (as defined below). &nbsp;Other information you
      may affirmatively provide to us is generally maintained along with Personal
      Information. You can choose not to provide any information that is requested
      of you by us. However, this may limit your ability to use the Service.
      &nbsp;
    </p>


    <p>Additionally, if a friend refers you to us by
      providing us with your e-mail address, we may send you a message.
      &nbsp;However, we use your e-mail address only to send the friend’s
      message unless you otherwise affirmatively provide information to us. When
      you sign up for e-mails or register an account, we may ask you for your
      birthdate to make sure you are 18 or older and may use a technical measure,
      such as a cookie, to restrict your ability to change your age. &nbsp;
    </p>


    <p>In addition to collecting information on the
      Service, we may collect information from you when you communicate with us
      over the phone, including via text messages, or via e-mail. This information
      may include Personal Information. This information may be matched with, and
      stored in connection with Personal Information provided or collected in
      connection with the Service.
    </p>


    <p>We also may now or in the future receive
      Personal Information about you from third parties. For example, if you access
      our Website or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, including
      social networking services such as Facebook where you have a registered
      account, that third party may pass certain information about your use of its
      service to Baby List. This information could include, but is not limited to,
      the user ID associated with your account, an access token necessary to access
      that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to
      share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with
      that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy
      settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting
      them to the Baby List Service.
    </p>


    <p><u>Information Collected
      Automatically</u>
    </p>


    <p>Log file information is automatically reported
      by your browser each time you access a web page on our Service. When you
      access the Service, our servers automatically record certain information that
      your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may
      include information such as your Internet Protocol address, web request,
      browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain
      names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other similar information.
      &nbsp;
    </p>


    <p>We may use certain third party services
      including, but not limited to, Google Analytics, to help us and our
      affiliates understand your use of the Service. These services collect
      information about your use of and the performance of the App and/or the
      Website and also collect information sent by your browser as part of a web
      page request, including cookies and your IP address, and their use of this
      information is governed by their privacy policies. &nbsp;
    </p>


    <p>In general, we will store tracking information
      in an anonymous aggregated form, however, we or our third party tracking
      partners may store certain information, such as page views, in a manner that
      can be associated to specific devices. &nbsp;
    </p>


    <p>We use persistent cookies and session cookies.
      A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.
      Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the
      Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web
      browser’s directions, but such removal may affect your use of or access
      to certain portion of the Service. A session cookie is temporary and
      disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to
      refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. &nbsp;If you
      refuse cookies you may not be able to experience all the features of our
      Website. We and our service providers may also use "pixel tags,"
      "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar means in
      connection with the Service and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other
      things, track the actions of Users and email recipients, to determine the
      success of marketing campaigns, to compile aggregate statistics about Website
      usage and response rates, and to serve online advertisements, whether via the
      Service or via another website.&nbsp;We may also engage one or more third
      party service providers to serve targeted online advertisements via
      Facebook.&nbsp;They may use a “pixel tag” to collect anonymous
      information about your visits to the Website and to other websites, and they
      may use that information to target advertisements for goods and services
      whether via the Website or other websites.&nbsp;This information is collected
      in a manner that may personally identify you.
    </p>

    </ul>

    <h4>HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</h4>

    <p><u>Personal Information:</u>&nbsp;Baby List
      will not rent or sell your Personal Information to others except with your explicit consent. To operate the Service,
      however, we may share your Personal Information with our agents,
      representatives and contractors so they can provide us with support services
      and other features and fulfill your orders. &nbsp;We require these third
      parties not to use your Personal Information for any other
      purpose.&nbsp; We may
      store Personal Information in locations outside the direct control of Baby

      providers).

    <p><u>Browsing Information</u>: We may share, rent or sell non-personally identifiable information
      (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types,
      number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand
      the usage patterns for our Service. Non-personally identifiable information
      may be stored indefinitely.&nbsp;
    </p>


    <p><u>Instances where we are required to share
      your information</u>: Baby List will disclose your
      information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably
      believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the
      reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use or to
      protect the security or integrity of our Service and our property (including
      our intellectual property); and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights,
      property, or personal safety of Baby List, our users or others.
    </p>


    <p><u>What happens in the event of a change of
      control</u>: We may buy or sell/divest/transfer our
      company (including any shares in our company), or any combination of our
      products, services, assets and/or businesses at any time. All information,
      whether Personal Information or Browsing Information, related to the Service
      may be sold or otherwise transferred in connection with any such
      transaction(s). We may also sell, assign or otherwise transfer such
      information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions,
      bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar
      transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of the company. Any
      transferees who receive your information in connection with a change of
      control must abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy.

    </p>

    <p>Only authorized Baby List staff have access to
      your Personal Information in its entirety. Other staff may have access to
      portions of this information if it pertains to their job duties.
    </p>

    <h4>YOUR CHOICES ABOUT RECEIVING MARKETING
      MESSAGES
    </h4>

    <p>Baby List offers you the choice of receiving
      different types of communication and information related to our company,
      products and services. You may subscribe to e-newsletters or other
      publications or you may also elect to receive marketing communications and
      other special offers from us via email. To help us understand whether we are
      providing information of interest to you, we may include software code or
      other tracking technologies in our emails to monitor whether you opened a
      particular email, whether you have clicked on the images and/or links in the
      email, the date and time the message was opened, and whether your computer is
      capable of receiving HTML-based email. We endeavor to allow you to
      unsubscribe at any time from our email programs by clicking on the
      unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email message. &nbsp;You may also
      access and manage your preferences from your account, when available, or by
      contacting us directly at support@babyli.st. We
      reserve the right to send you service announcements or similar administrative
      messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving
      them.
    </p>

    <u>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION; SECURITY
      AND PASSWORDS
    </u>

    <p>Baby List takes what it believes to be
      commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to
      protect Personal Information. However, since no security system is
      impenetrable and "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet,
      we cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information or Browsing
      Information.
    </p>

    <p>If you create an account to use the Service,
      you may be asked to choose a password for your account, which can be used to
      access information associated with your account (including Personal
      Information). You should choose a password that is not easy to guess, and
      does not use words that you would find in a dictionary. Do not disclose your
      password to any other person. You are responsible for maintaining the
      confidentiality of your password and account, and we will attribute
      activities that occur using your account information (e.g., through the use
      of your password) to you. If you suspect that your password has been
      compromised contact us immediately at support@babyli.st.
    </p>

    <h4>COMPROMISE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>

    <p>In the event that Personal Information is
      compromised as a result of a breach of security, Baby List will promptly
      notify those persons whose Personal Information has been compromised, in
      accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy,
      or as otherwise required by applicable law. In the event that we or our
      Service suffers a data security breach that requires us to provide you with
      notice, such as under applicable law, you consent to allow us to provide you
      with such notice by sending an e-mail to the primary e-mail address that is
      associated with your account.
    </p>

    <h4>NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES</h4>

    <p>It is our policy to provide notifications,
      whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other
      business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy
      notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the Service, as
      determined by Baby List in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to
      determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that
      you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy
      Policy.
    </p>

    <h4>HOW YOU CAN UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION</h4>

    <p>Baby List believes strongly in giving you the
