Your privacy is very important to us. We created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.  The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site:
<p>

<p>



<a name="info-collected">
</a></p><h3><a name="info-collected">Information We Collect</a></h3><a name="info-collected">
We collect two types of information from you: information you submit to us and data our site gathers automatically.
<p>

<b>1. &nbsp;Information You Submit to Us:</b><br>
Everyone is welcome to browse our site and there is no requirement to purchase anything at any time. If you decide to make a purchase, we will gather several pieces of information from you during the checkout process.
</p><p>

Our order form uses required and non required fields. We require only the most basic contact information needed to process your payment and properly ship your order, such as name, address, phone number, and e-mail address and payment information. You may choose to not submit payment information online if this makes you uncomfortable. Simply fill out the basic information on the order form and then choose "Off-line Payment" to pay by phone, mail, or fax.
</p><p>

There are also non required fields on our order form that you may use to provide more data and instructions so that your order can be handled in the way you want. Some non required information would be a separate shipping address, gift wrapping information, special shipping instructions, etc.
</p><p>

<b>2. &nbsp;Information Gathered Automatically:</b><br>
Just like most web sites, our server automatically gathers some usage information from you so that we can improve and enhance our site based on user patterns.
</p></a><p><a name="info-collected">

As you browse our Web site, it collects log file, IP address, and other standard tracking data we use to evaluate site traffic patterns and popular areas and pages. Such information is aggregated with tracking data from all site visitors and is never associated with individually identifiable information that would reveal any personal information about you.
