<li>We endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect your Data. All the Data collected by us is stored on a secure server. The secure server software encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us.</li>
<li>We recommend that you protect your password, username and your computer from access by unauthorised users. We suggest that you change your password on a regular basis. Please ensure that you sign out when you finish using the Babelgum Services.</li>
<li>If you are resident in the United States we will notify you at the most current email address that you have provided to us in the event of a security breach.

Any security breach notice will be sent to you in as soon as possible following our discovery or notice of a security breach, and without unreasonable delay, subject to any determination by a law enforcement agency that notice would impede a criminal investigation, in which case the notice will be sent once the agency determines that notice will not compromise the investigation. If you would prefer to receive a security breach notice by regular mail, advise us of that fact by writing to us at: Floor 9, 665 Fifth Avenue, New York City, NY 10022, USA.</li>
