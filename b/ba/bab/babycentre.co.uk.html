<h1>Privacy &amp; Security</h1>
<!--startindex-->
<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Welcome to BabyCentre.co.uk, a web site owned by BabyCenter, L.L.C. This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may provide via this site. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting information to this site. </p>

<h2>Your Consent</h2>
<p>By using this site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the BabyCenter <a href="/about/use">Terms of Use</a>. Whenever you submit information via this site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>About Children</h2>
<p>This site is not intended for children under the age of 13. We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information via this site from visitors in this age group. We do, however, collect information about children and babies from their parents. We ask that our users not provide information about a baby or child without first getting the parents' consent. We encourage parents to talk to their children about their use of the Internet and the information they disclose to Web sites.</p>

<h2>Information You Provide</h2>
<p>This site actively collects information from its visitors both by asking you specific questions and by permitting you to communicate directly with us via e-mail, feedback forms, and/or chat rooms. Some of the information that you submit may be personally identifiable information (that is, information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and so on).</p>

<p>Some areas of this site may ask you to submit personally identifiable information in order for you to benefit from the specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers, order processing, or resume submission) or to participate in a particular activity (such as sweepstakes or other promotions). You will be informed what information is required and what information is optional.</p>

<h2>Passive Information Collection</h2>
<p>As you navigate through this site, certain anonymous information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream). Your Internet browser automatically transmits to this site some of this anonymous information, such as the URL of the Web site you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer is currently using. This site may also collect anonymous information from your computer through cookies and Internet tags or web beacons. You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of this site might not work without cookies. </p>

<p>This site may use and combine such passively collected anonymous information to provide better service to site visitors, customize the site based on your preferences, compile and analyze statistics and trends, and otherwise administer and improve the site for your use. We may at times combine personally identifiable information with passively collected information in order to personalise offers and the site for our users (for example, combined information may allow us to recommend products or features to you based on what you have liked in the past). For more information about cookies and other passive tracking methods discussed above, please click <a href="/about/privacy/privacy-passive-info/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Use and Disclosure of Information</h2>
<p>Except as otherwise stated, we may use information collected via this site to improve the content of our site, to customize the site to your preferences, to communicate information to you (if you have requested it), for our marketing and research purposes, and for any other purpose specified. In addition, we may make full use of all information acquired through this site that is not in personally identifiable form.</p>
 
<p>If you provide personally identifiable information to this site, we may combine such information with other actively collected information unless we specify otherwise at the point of collection. We also may disclose personally identifiable information you provide via this site to third parties, but only:</p>

<p>(i) to carefully selected partners who have offers that may be of interest to you, provided you have requested such offers, in which case we will require such partners to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and use it for the same purposes.</p>
 
<p>(ii) to contractors we use to support our business (such as technical support and delivery services), in which case we will require such third parties to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and use it for the same purposes. </p>

<p>One such contractor is DoubleClick, Inc., who manages many of the advertisements you see on the Web site. For more information on DoubleClick, including your choices on how DoubleClick uses certain non-personal information, click <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>BabyCenter also contracts with an analytics company, to measure: how visitors use our site, which offers visitors find of interest, and other visitor activities. To do this, BabyCenter uses cookies and "Internet tags" (beacons) provided by a analytics company. The types of information we collect include: pages you have visited and paths taken through the site. By supplementing our records with such information, we learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. While the analytics company logs information coming from our site, BabyCenter retains full ownership of data stored by the analytics company, and controls how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to have your information collected by the analytics company as described herein, you can "opt-out" of the analytical tool by clicking <a href="http://www.omniture.com/privacy/optout.html" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

<p>(iii) in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business of this site to which the information relates, in which case we will require any such buyer to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and use it for the same purposes; or </p>

<p>(iv) to respond to law enforcement requests or where required by applicable laws, court orders, or government regulations. </p>

<p>The collection, use, and disclosure of information contemplated in this Privacy Policy involves a transfer of the information to the United States and possibly other jurisdictions that may not have equivalent laws and rules regarding personally identifiable information as your country of residency. </p>

<h2>Public Areas</h2>
<p>Our site also has public areas such as chat rooms and message boards. Please remember that any information you share in these areas becomes public, so you should be careful about what you disclose. If you post comments about BabyCenter services on our site, there's a chance we'll publish them for editorial purposes or in promotional advertising and/or marketing materials.</p>

<h2>Access, Correction, and Deletion</h2>
<p>To keep personally identifiable information that you provide via this site accurate, current, and complete, please contact us as specified below and we will take appropriate steps to update or correct such information in our possession, or to delete your information from our contact list. If we no longer need personally identifiable information for any of the purposes referred to in this policy, we will take reasonable steps to either destroy or de-identify your information.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>This site takes reasonable steps to protect personally identifiable information as you transmit it to our site and to protect such information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from this site may not be secure. </p>

<h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>
<p>This site may contain links or references to other Web sites to which this Privacy Policy does not apply. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy of every Web site you visit.</p>
