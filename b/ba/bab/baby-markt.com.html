    DATA PROTECTION OFFICER The Data Protection Officer can be reached at: E-Mail:
    <a href="mailto:datenschutz@babymarkt.de">datenschutz@babymarkt.de</a></p><h3>1. THE REASONS OF DATA COLLECTION
</h3><p>We collect and process your information to provide our website and to provide you with the best possible service through
    convenient access to our services.
</p><h3>2. WHICH DATA WILL BE COLLECTED, PROCESSED OR UTILIZED?
</h3><h4>2.1 VISITING OUR WEBSITE
</h4><p>When you access our website, our servers automatically collect information of a general nature, especially for the purposes
    of connection setup, functionality and system security. This includes the type of browser used, the operating system
    used, the domain name of the Internet service provider, the connection data of the computer used (IP address), the website
    from which you visit us (referrer URL), the pages you visit on our website and the date and duration of the visit. Conclusions
    from this data on certain persons are not possible for us due to a pseudonymization.</p><h4>2.2 CONTACT FORM
</h4><p>If you contact us via a contact form, personal data will be collected. Which data are collected in each case can be found
    in the contact form. The data will be stored for the purpose of processing your request. Mandatory information is indicated
    by an asterisk (*). All other details are optional. We delete the data we recieved from the contact form after the storage
    is no longer required, or restrict the processing if there are statutory retention requirements. Legal basis for processing
    your personal information is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR when it comes to contacting us in the context of a contract.
    Incidentally, it is our legitimate interest to answer your inquiries, so in this case Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR is
    the legal basis.
</p><h4>2.3 NEWSLETTER- SIGN UP
</h4><p>With your consent, you can subscribe to our free e-mail newsletter, which will inform you about current interesting offers.
    To register for the newsletter, we use the so-called double opt-in procedure. This means that after you have registered,
    we will send you an e-mail to the e-mail address specified in which we ask you to confirm that you wish to receive the
    newsletter. If you do not confirm your registration, your information will be blocked and automatically deleted after
    one month. In addition, we store your IP addresses and times of registration and confirmation. The purpose of the procedure
    is to prove your registration and, if necessary, to inform you about possible misuse of your personal data. The only
    requirement for sending the newsletter is your e-mail address. All other details are optional. After your confirmation,
    we will store your data for the purpose of sending you the newsletter. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any
    time by notifying the person responsible, see at the beginning of our data protection instructions, e.g. by e-mail to

    § 7 (3) UWG, no separate consent from you is required. The data processing is based on our legitimate interest in the
    transmission of personalized direct mail in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. However, if you have initially
    objected to the use of your e-mail address for this aforementioned purpose, we will of course not send you any e-mails.
    Even if you have not initially objected, you are entitled to object to the use of your e-mail address for the aforementioned
    advertising purpose at any time with effect for the future by notifying the person responsible (cf. beginning of our
    Privacy Policy). Only the transmission costs according to the basic tariffs will be charged. Upon receipt of your objection,
    the use of your e-mail address for advertising purposes will be discontinued immediately.
</p><h4>2.5 DATA PROCESSING WHEN OPENING A CUSTOMER ACCOUNT/REGISTRATION
</h4><p>We collect and process personal data if you provide us with this data when executing a contract or opening a customer account.
    The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR. Which data is collected can be taken from the respective input forms.
    The deletion of your customer account is possible at any time and can be done by sending a message to the contact address
    of the responsible person. We store and use the data provided by you for contract processing between you and us. After
    complete processing of the contract or deletion of your customer account, your data will be blocked in consideration
    of tax and commercial retention periods and deleted after expiry of these periods, unless you have expressly consented
    to further use of your data or a legally permitted further use of data has been reserved by our site, about which we

    after expiry of these periods, unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data or a legally permitted

    is necessary for the delivery of the goods. For the purpose of arranging the delivery date for forwarding goods, we will

</h3><p>We also collect and process personal data from applicants for the purpose of handling our application process. Processing
    can also be carried out electronically. This is always the case if the applicant submits application documents to us
    electronically, i.e. by e-mail or via a web form implemented on our website. If we conclude an employment contract with

    a burden of proof in proceedings under the General Act on Equal Treatment. We would like to evaluate all applicants only

    religious or ideological beliefs or any trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data to clearly identify a natural

    data concerning you under Article 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The
    data controller no longer processes the personal data concerning you, unless he can prove compelling reasons worthy of
    protection for the processing, which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert,
    exercise or defend legal claims. If you object to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data concerning
    you will no longer be processed for these purposes. You have the possibility to exercise your right of objection in connection
    with the use of Information Society services by means of automated procedures using technical specifications, notwithstanding

</h4><p>The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling,
    which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her. Paragraph 1 shall not
    apply if the decision:</p><ul><li>is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller;</li><li>is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures
        to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or </li><li>is based on the data subject's explicit consent. </li></ul><p>However, these decisions may not be based on special categories of personal data pursuant to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR, unless
    Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a) or g) GDPR applies and appropriate measures have been taken to protect your rights and freedoms
    and your legitimate interests.
</p><h4>18.10 RIGHT TO COMPLAIN TO A SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY
</h4><p>Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, every data subject shall have the right to lodge a complaint
    with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, place of work or place
    of the alleged infringement if the data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to him or her
    infringes this Regulation.</p><p>The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant of the status and results of
    the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy under Article 78 GDPR. Last updated: May 2018
