                  <b>baja.com</b> does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals<br>
                  like you, except when such individuals specifically provide such information on a<br>
                  voluntary basis. For example, such personally identifiable information may be<br>
                  gathered from a contest or sweepstakes registration, the registration process<br>
                  for subscription sites or services and in connection with content submissions,<br>

                  information on individual users will not be sold or otherwise transferred to<br>
                  unaffiliated third parties without the approval of the user at the time of<br>
                  collection. At such points of collection, the user will have the opportunity to<br>
                  indicate whether he or she would like to "opt out" of receiving promotional<br>
                  and/or marketing information about other products, services and offerings<br>

                  <b>baja.com</b> reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and<br>
                  characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of<br>
                  the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number<br>
                  of users that have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners.<br>
                  <b>baja.com</b> will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties.<br>
                  Also, users should be aware that <b>baja.com</b> may sometimes permit third parties<br>
                  to offer subscription and/or registration-based services through a <b>baja.com</b> site.<br>
                  <b>baja.com</b> is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties and<br>
                  users should check the applicable privacy policy of such party when<br>

<p align="justify">
                  Additionally, users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose<br>
                  personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the<br>
                  bulletin boards or in the chat areas of the <b>baja.com</b> sites, that information, along<br>
                  with any substantive information disclosed in the user's communication, can<br>
                  be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in<br>
                  unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are<br>
                  beyond the control of <b>baja.com</b>. </p>
<p align="justify">
                  Users also should be aware that non-personal information and data may be<br>
                  automatically collected through the standard operation of <b>baja.com</b>'s internet<br>
                  servers or through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files a web<br>
                  site can use to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to<br>
                  and use of the site and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile<br>
                  aggregate data that will allow content improvements and targeted<br>
                  advertising. Cookies are not programs that come onto a user's system and<br>
                  damage files. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the<br>
                  user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. Users should be aware<br>
                  that <b>baja.com</b> cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by<br>
                  advertisers or third parties hosting data for <b>baja.com</b>. If a user does not want<br>
                  information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure<br>
                  in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature;<br>
                  however, users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide the<br>
                  user with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available<br>
                  on the <b>baja.com</b> Site. </p>
<p align="justify">
                  Upon request, <b>baja.com</b> will allow any user to "opt out" of further promotional<br>
                  contacts at any time. Additionally upon request, <b>baja.com</b> will use reasonable<br>
                  efforts to allow users to update/correct personal information previously<br>
                  submitted which the user states is erroneous to the extent such activities will<br>
                  not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon a user's request,<br>
                  <b>baja.com</b> will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally delete the user<br>
                  and his or her personal information from its database; however, it may be<br>
                  impossible to delete a user's entry without some residual information because<br>
                  of backups and records of deletions. </p>

                  The foregoing policies are effective as of August 8, 1995. <b>baja.com</b> reserves<br>
