We do not share your email address with 3rd parties for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>
<strong>Contests or Sweepstakes:</strong> We periodically operate contests and sweepstakes through the Website that may require registration or the submission of personal information. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website. Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes, (see the rules of each contest for details about how your personal information will be used). We may also ask your permission to allow us to publicly post some of your information on the Website, such as on a winner's page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. Except as required by applicable law, we will not post your information without your permission. In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Website, and collect your information. In those cases, where we are not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we do not collect your information and we have no control over the information collected from you.

<strong>Games:</strong> When you register to play games on our Website, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies:</strong> As with many Websites, our Website uses a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a unique, random number that is stored in the browser on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify you, just the computer that is used to visit the site. Cookies automatically identify your browser to the Website whenever your computer is used to visit the Website. Cookies also let us know how many people visit our website and where visitors go on the site. In addition, cookies can let us know non-personally identifiable information, like what web browser is being used to access the website. For registered users, cookies can make using the Website easier for you by saving information such as your passwords or preferences. By tracking how and when you use the Website, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Website are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Website. Cookies may also allow the Website to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, your browser should contain an option that allows you to disable or delete cookie data at any time. Some areas of the Website, however, may not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. We do store session based cookies, but they are NOT tied to personal information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technology:</strong> Our Website uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites. We also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Web sites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Web sites. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.</p>
<p>
<strong>IP Addresses and Click-Stream Data:</strong> We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data. An IP address is a number associated with the service through which you access the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors, for example regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information. Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Website. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Website, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.</p>
<p>
<strong>Transaction Information:</strong> If you conduct a financial transaction with our Website, such as order information from our Website, buy our products, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including contact information, demographic information and financial information. If you choose to send a gift to a friend, we will ask you for your friend's name, email address, and shipping address.

For your protection, such information is collected and stored through encrypted means.</p>

<div class="subtitle">WITH WHOM THE INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED</div>
<p>At times, we may share your personal information with others for various purposes. The following outlines the ways in which your information may be shared with others and the ways in which you may opt-out of having your information shared:</p>
<p>
<strong>Agents:</strong> We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, Website analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for their own purposes, like sending you marketing offers about their products.</p>
<p>When ordering tickets, the consumer will be brought to the TicketMaster website and any information given is done directly with TicketMaster. Please be aware that although these pages may have the look and the feel of the Ravens website, you are actually giving your information directly to TicketMaster.</p>
<p>
<strong>Aggregate Information:</strong> We may share aggregate information, such as demographics and Website usage statistics, with advertisers, sponsors or other organizations. When this type of information is shared, the other parties do not have access to your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Other Promotional Offers:</strong> We may send offers to you on behalf of our marketing partners. When we do this, we do not give that partner your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, you may discontinue these emails and/or mailings by writing to: Baltimore Ravens Mailing List, 1 Winning Drive, Owings Mills, MD 21117 or send an email to <a href="mailto:contactus@ravens.nfl.net">contactus@ravens.nfl.net</a> requesting your name and information be taken off the Ravens distribution lists.</p>
<p>
<strong>Third-Party Audience and Traffic Measurement Services:</strong> Audience and Traffic Measurement Services allow us to collect anonymous traffic and behavior information from our Website by monitoring anonymous visitor activity. Although these companies do not have access to the Website cookies, the Website's traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have your cookies enabled in your browser. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.</p>
<p>
<strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event that all or substantially all of our assets are sold or transferred to another party, or another transaction occurs in which your personally identifiable information is one of the business assets transferred, all personally identifiable information that has been collected and saved may be one of the business assets we transfer. See "Your Acceptance Of The Privacy Policy And Notification Of Changes To The Policy" section below.</p>
<p>
<strong>Administrative or Legal Process:</strong> Your personal information may be transferred to third parties without notice to you in order to comply with applicable law, law enforcement agencies, to protect our rights, or protect the rights of other users of this website.</p>
