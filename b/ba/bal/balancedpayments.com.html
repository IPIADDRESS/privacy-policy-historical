<p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how your personal information is
collected, used and disclosed by Balanced and its subsidiaries and
affiliated companies ("Balanced"). This Policy applies to the websites of
Balanced, including <a href="https://balancedpayments.com">https://balancedpayments.com</a> ("Sites") and Balanced's other
products, services or any other features, technologies or functionalities
offered by us on our Sites or through any other means (collectively,
"Services"). This Policy does not apply to information you provide directly to
third party websites or third party applications that use Balanced's Services.
We do not control the activities of such third parties and advise you to
consult their privacy policies before you share your personal information.</p>
<h3 id="personal-information-collected">PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>
<p>We collect information about you in various ways when you use our Sites and
Services. For example, we collect information you provide to us when you
register for a Balanced account or sign up through a partner marketplace,
initiate or accept a payment, request
customer service or respond to a Balanced survey. Such personal information
may include your name, address, email address, credit card information and
bank account and routing numbers. Before you use the Services, we may also
require you to provide additional information that we can use to verify your
identity, such as your date of birth, Social Security number or other
information. Finally, we may obtain information about you from other sources,
including third party websites or applications that offer the Balanced
Services, and combine that with information we collect on our Sites and
through our Services.</p>
<p>When you visit our Sites or use our Services, some information is
automatically collected. For example, when you visit our Sites, your
computer's operating system, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, access times,
browser type and language and the website you visited before our Sites are
logged automatically. We also collect information about your usage and
activity on our Sites and Services.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies.</strong> We automatically collect information using "cookies." Cookies are
small data files stored on your hard drive by a website. Among other things,
cookies help us improve our Sites, Services and your experience. We use browser
cookies to see which areas and features are popular and to count visits to our
Sites. We also use flash cookies for fraud prevention purposes. You can usually
choose to set your browser to remove and/or reject cookies. For instructions on
removing or rejecting flash cookies, please see Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft
Silverlight. If you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect
certain features or services of our Sites or Services. Please note that you
may also encounter cookies from third parties when using the Balanced Services
on websites that we do not control.</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> We may also collect information using Web beacons. Web beacons
are electronic images that may be used on our Sites, in our Services or in our
emails. We use Web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage
and campaign effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted
upon.</p>
<h3 id="use-of-personal-information-we-collect">USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

<h3 id="sharing-of-personal-information">SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

applications; however, we will not share any personal information with these
third parties.</p>
<p>We may also share your personal information with third party vendors,
consultants and other service providers who work on our behalf (e.g., fraud
and identity theft prevention and security auditing services). Furthermore, to
verify your identity, we may share your personal information with third-party

  protect the rights and property of Balanced, our agents, users and others,
  including to enforce our terms, policies and guidelines; or in an emergency
  to protect the personal safety of Balanced, our users or any other person;</li>
<li>in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing or
  acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company; and</li>
<li>with your consent or direction to do so.</li>

destruction.</p>
<h3 id="your-information-choices-and-changes">YOUR INFORMATION CHOICES AND CHANGES</h3>

instructions in those emails or by emailing us at  . If you opt out, we may
still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your accounts or
our ongoing business relations. In addition, you can review and edit your
personal information at any time by logging into your account.</p>
<h3 id="changes-to-this-policy">CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h3>
