    collected, used and disclosed by Balanced and its subsidiaries and
    affiliated companies ("Balanced"). This Policy applies to the websites of
    Balanced, including <a href="https://balancedpayments.com"></a><a href="https://balancedpayments.com">https://balancedpayments.com</a> ("Sites") and Balanced's other
    products, services or any other features, technologies or functionalities
    offered by us on our Sites or through any other means (collectively,
    "Services"). This Policy does not apply to information you provide directly to
    third party websites or third party applications that use Balanced's Services.
    We do not control the activities of such third parties and advise you to
    consult their privacy policies before you share your personal information.</p>
  <h3 id="personal-information-collected">PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>
  <p>We collect information about you in various ways when you use our Sites and
    Services. For example, we collect information you provide to us when you
    register for a Balanced account or sign up through a partner marketplace,
    initiate or accept a payment, request
    customer service or respond to a Balanced survey. Such personal information
    may include your name, address, email address, credit card information and
    bank account and routing numbers. Before you use the Services, we may also
    require you to provide additional information that we can use to verify your
    identity, such as your date of birth, Social Security number or other
    information. Finally, we may obtain information about you from other sources,
    including third party websites or applications that offer the Balanced
    Services, and combine that with information we collect on our Sites and
    through our Services.</p>
  <p>When you visit our Sites or use our Services, some information is
    automatically collected. For example, when you visit our Sites, your
    computer's operating system, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, access times,
    browser type and language and the website you visited before our Sites are
    logged automatically. We also collect information about your usage and
    activity on our Sites and Services.</p>
  <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> We automatically collect information using "cookies." Cookies are
    small data files stored on your hard drive by a website. Among other things,
    cookies help us improve our Sites, Services and your experience. We use browser
    cookies to see which areas and features are popular and to count visits to our
    Sites. We also use flash cookies for fraud prevention purposes. You can usually
    choose to set your browser to remove and/or reject cookies. For instructions on
    removing or rejecting flash cookies, please see Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft
