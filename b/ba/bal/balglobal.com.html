<p><strong>PRIVACY AND COOKIES POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Effective Date: 10/15/2018</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Who we are</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>This Privacy and Cookies Policy describes how BAL collects Personal Data (defined below) through various means, including questionnaires, <a href="http://www.balglobal.com/"><strong>www.balglobal.com</strong></a>&nbsp;(the “Website”) and its secured access sites, including, but not limited to <strong>cobalt.balglobal.com</strong> <strong>(the “Secured Access Sites”),</strong> and BAL’s use of that Personal Data. This Privacy and Cookies Policy applies to Personal Data collected by BAL including, but not limited to all Websites and/or Secured Access Sites that post a link to this Privacy and Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>Personal Data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to physical, psychological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.&nbsp; Sensitive Personal Data means information that reveals racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health and data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>This Privacy and Cookies Policy applies to Personal Data BAL collects: (i) under the direction of its clients, both from the client itself and directly from individuals (known as the client employee or beneficiary) (“Client Personal Data”); and (ii) otherwise than under the direction of its clients, for example, from visitors to its Website (“Visitor Personal Data”).</p>
<p>Personal Data may be shared between Berry Appleman and Leiden LLP and subcontractors who perform services and functions on our behalf to assist us with our business activities and to support our interactions with you, for example, processing immigration documentation. Where BAL collects and uses Personal Data about individuals in the European Union (“EU”), it will comply with all applicable data protection laws as they may vary from time to time (including, but not limited to, the UK Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”) and the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”)) (“Applicable Data Protection Laws”).</p>
<p>In relation to Client Personal Data, BAL is a “Processor” for the purposes of the Applicable Data Protection Laws.&nbsp; This means BAL will only process the Personal Data it collects concerning a client, client employees and client employees’ dependants, in accordance with written instructions from its client, which is the “Controller” for the purposes of the Applicable Data Protection Laws.</p>
<p>In relation to Visitor Personal Data, BAL is the “Controller” for the purposes of Applicable Data Protection Laws.</p>
<p>BAL has appointed a Data Protection Officer who can be contacted at privacy@balglobal.com</p>
<p>BAL is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. The following describes what Personal Data is collected and explains how that Personal Data may be used and shared with third parties and how BAL secures the Personal Data you provide us.
