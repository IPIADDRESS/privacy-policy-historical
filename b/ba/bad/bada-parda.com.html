<font face="Verdana" size="2">www.chotaparda.com - has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm 
commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and 
dissemination practices for <a href="http://www.Chotaparda.com">
<font color="#606088">www.chotaparda.com</font></a></font><p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Cookies:</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Our Site, like most other sites, uses cookies to provide you 
with a more personalized and user-friendly experience. A cookie is a message 
that is sent to a browser from a Web server and stored on your computerï¿½s hard 
drive. Cookies help us keep track of the size of our audience, the frequency of 
visits to our Site and the areas that are most popular. If a guest makes a 
purchase, cookies are used to keep the shopping cart active during the shopping 
process. We may also use cookies to help us deliver content or advertising 
specific to your interests, and to save your preferences or passwords so you 
don't have to re-enter them each time you visit our Site. Most browsers allow 
you to reject all cookies, but then your preferences, passwords and other 
information will not be saved, and you may have to re-enter information to use 
certain features of our Site. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">We may also log IP addresses for the purposes of systems 
administration or to report information in aggregate form to our advertisers 
(e.g., how many visitors logged in to our Web site). In some cases your IP 
address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a 
consumer Internet access provider such as AOL or Earthlink or Satyam, chances 
are that your IP address varies each sessionï¿½thus making it effectively 
impossible for us to use your IP address (by itself) to determine who you are.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Advertisement:</font></p>
<p><font size="2">We may use an outside ad company to display ads on our Site. 
These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web 
site, cookies delivered through banner ads are collected by our ad company, and 
we do not have access to this information. www.chotaparda.com may also serve 
banner ads that contain cookies. We will only share such information with our 
advertisers and sponsors on an aggregate basis to determine the success of any 
given banner, logo or advertisement.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The Site contains links and advertisements to other sites. If 
you click-through a banner ad or link and submit your information to that 
advertiser or site, you will be subject to their own privacy practices. 
www.chotaparda.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of 
such other sites.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Public Forums Rules and Policies:</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The Site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news 
groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is 
disclosed in these areas becomes public information and that if you disclose 
personal contact information in these areas, others may use it to send you 
unsolicited messages </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">so you should exercise 
caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.</font><font size="2">. 
We do not control the actions of our guests and registered members. 
www.chotaparda.com encourages our users to be smart about choosing when, and to 
whom to release information online.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Of course there are many other ways we conceivably could get 
information from or about you that are not described elsewhere in this 
Statement. For example, you might email us through one of our customer service 
email addresses, or we may get a complaint about you from a third party. Our 
practices with respect to such information are pretty much as youï¿½d expect -- we 
use and disclose this information in a commercially reasonable business manner.
</font></p>
<p><font size="2">You agree not to use forum to post any material which is 
vulgar, defamatory, inaccurate, harassing, hateful, threatening, invading of 
others privacy, sexually oriented, or violates any laws. You also agree that you 
will not post any copyrighted material that is not owned by yourself or the 
owners of these forums. <br>
<br>
You remain solely responsible for the content of your messages, and you agree to 
indemnify and hold harmless this forum and their agents with respect to any 
claim based upon any post you may make. We also reserve the right to reveal 
whatever information we know about you in the event of a complaint or legal 
action arising from any message posted by yourself.<br>
<br>
Although messages posted are not the responsibility of this forum and we are not 
responsible for the content or accuracy of any of these messages, we reserve the 
right to delete any message for any or no reason whatsoever. If you do find any 
posts are objectionable then please contact Us. We delete the objectionable from 
our forums. <br>
<br>
The Federal Trade Commission's Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 
(COPPA) requires that Web Sites are to obtain parental consent before 
collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from children under 13. If 
you are a minor under 13, you are prohibited from submitting anything in forums.</font></p>
<p>Security:</p>
<p><font size="2">This site has industry consistent security measures in place 
to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our 
control. But since the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure, 
www.chotaparda.com assumes no liability for disclosure of data due to errors in 
transmission or unauthorized third parties.&nbsp; </font></p>
<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">Contacting the Web Site </font></h2>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you have any questions about this privacy 
statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you 
can <a href="http://www.Chotaparda.com/contact%20us.asp">
<font color="#ffffff">contact Us</font></a></font></p>
<p><font size="2">By using the Site, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy 
Statement. If you are not comfortable with any policy described in this Privacy 
Statement, you may feel free to e-mail us with questions or concerns, but your 
only remedy is to discontinue use of the Site. We reserve the right to modify 
this Privacy Statement at any time. </font></p>
