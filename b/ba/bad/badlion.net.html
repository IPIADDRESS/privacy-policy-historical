<p>12. Social Media</p>
<p>TEO maintains online presence within social networks and platforms in order to communicate with customers and users active there, and to inform them about TEO services. When calling the respective networks and platforms, the terms and conditions and the data processing guidelines apply to their respective operators.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated in our Privacy Policy, users' data will be processed as long as they communicate with TEO within social networks and platforms, e.g. write posts on TEO’s online presence or send messages.</p>
<p>13. Integration of Services and Contents of Third Parties</p>
<p>Based on TEO’s legitimate interests (such as interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. GDPR), TEO make use of content or services offered by third-party providers in order to provide their content and services, such as including videos (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Content").</p>
<p>This always presupposes that the third party providers of this content perceive the IP address of the users, since they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of this content. TEO endeavors to use only content whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content. Third parties may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also referred to as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may include, but is not limited to, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring web sites, visit time, and other information regarding the use of TEO Sites.</p>

<p> TEO embeds videos on the YouTube platform of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA<br>

GDPR) Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbor, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook"). The plugins can represent interaction elements or content (such as videos, graphics or text contributions) and can be recognized by one of the Facebook logos (white "f" on blue tile, the terms "Like", "Like" or a "thumbs up" sign) or are marked with the addition "Facebook Social Plugin". The list and appearance of Facebook Social Plugins can be viewed here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.</p>

The content of the plugin is transmitted by Facebook directly to the device of the user and incorporated by him into the online offer. In the process, user profiles can be created from the processed data. TEO has no control over the amount of data Facebook collects using this plugin.</p>
<p>By integrating the plugins, Facebook receives the information that a user has accessed the corresponding page of the online offer. If the user is logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to his Facebook account. If users interact with the plugins, for example, press the Like button or leave a comment, the information is transmitted from your device directly to Facebook and stored there. If a user is not a member of Facebook, there is still the possibility that Facebook will find out and save their IP address. </p>
<p>The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as the related rights and setting options for the protection of your privacy, can be found in the privacy policy of Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.</p>
<p>If a user is a Facebook member and does not want Facebook to collect data about him via this online offer and link it to his member data stored on Facebook, he must log out of Facebook and delete their cookies before using TEO Sites.
