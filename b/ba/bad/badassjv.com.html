<b>4. Our Disclosure of Your Information</b><br><br>

Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure
that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable
information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described
in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting and
foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government,
law enforcement agencies or third parties. Under certain circumstances,
third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions
or private communications, or members may abuse or misuse your
information that they collect from our Websites. Therefore, although
we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we
do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally
identifiable information or private communications will always
remain private.<br><br>

As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally
identifiable information about you to any third party. However,
the following describes some of the ways that your personally
identifiable information may be disclosed.<br><br>

Financial Information. Under some circumstances we may require
some additional information, such as, but not limited to credit
card details. We use this financial information, including your
name, address, and other information, as well as to bill you for
use of our services. We use your financial information to check
your qualifications, to bill you for services and/or products,
to enable you to participate in discount, rebate and similar programs
in which you may elect to participate. By making a purchase, or
engaging in any other kind of activity or transaction that uses
financial information on the Websites, you consent to our providing
of your financial information to our service providers and to
such third parties as we determine are necessary to support and
process your activities and transactions, as well as to your credit
card issuer for their purposes. These third parties may include
the credit card companies and banking institutions used to process
and support the transaction or activity. By purchasing, or registering
or making reservations for products or services of third parties
offered on the Websites, or by participating in programs offered
on the Websites that are administered by third parties and that
require you to submit financial information in order to use them,
you also consent to our providing your financial information to
those third parties. Any of these various third parties may be
authorized to use your financial information in accordance with
our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in accordance
with their own privacy policies, over which we have no control,
and you agree that we are not responsible or liable for any of
their actions or omissions. Additionally, you agree that we may
use and disclose all such information so submitted to such third
parties in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and
disclose any other information that you submit to us.<br><br>

Advertisers. We aggregate (gather up data across all our members'
accounts) personally identifiable information and disclose such
information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers
and other third parties for other marketing and promotional purposes.
However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities
any information that could be used to identify you personally.
Certain information, such as your name, email address, password,
credit card number and bank account number, are never disclosed
to marketing advertisers. We may use third-party advertising companies
to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies
and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons)
to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these
third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely
anonymous.<br><br>

External Service Providers. There may be a number of services
offered by external service providers that help you use our Websites.
If you choose to use these optional services, and in the course
of doing so, disclose information to the external service providers,
and/or grant them permission to collect information about you,
then their use of your information is governed by their private
policy.<br><br>

Other Corporate Entities. We share much of our data, including
personally identifiable information about you, with our parent
and/or subsidiaries that are committed to serving your online
needs and related services, throughout the world. To the extent
that these entities have access to your information, they will
treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they
obtain from their other members. Our parent and/or subsidiaries
will follow privacy practices no less protective of all members
than our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed
by applicable law. It is possible that We and/or its subsidiaries,
or any combination of such, could merge with or be acquired by
another business entity. Should such a combination occur, you
should expect that we would share some or all of your information
in order to continue to provide the service. You will receive
notice of such event (to the extent it occurs) and we will require
that the new combined entity follow the practices disclosed in
this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

Legal Requests. we cooperates with law enforcement inquiries,
as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual
property rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorize
us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement and
other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe
necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation
of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity
that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.<br><br>

<b>5. Your Use of other Members Information</b><br><br>

Our services also include access to instant messaging and chat
rooms. As a member you have access to the Member's ID No., and
you might gain access to other contact information of the Member(s)
through the regular use of the instant messaging and chat rooms.
By accepting this Privacy Policy, you agree that, with respect
to other Members' personally identifiable information that you
obtain through instant messaging communication, the chat rooms
and email, We hereby grants to you a license to use such information
only for: (a) Your Company related communications that are not
unsolicited commercial messages, and (b) any other purpose that
such member expressly agrees to after adequate disclosure of the
purpose(s). In all cases, you must give Members an opportunity
to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review
what information you have collected about them. In addition, under
no circumstances, except as defined in this Section, can you disclose
personally identifiable information about another member to any
