Badoo does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders.</p> <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2> <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy or email practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p> <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.
