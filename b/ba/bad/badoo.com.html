These details are available to you anytime, and capable of being corrected or updated (with the exception of gender and profile address) through your "Profile" page.</p>

    <h2>Information that is collected automatically</h2>

    <p>While using our website, we will automatically track certain information such as your IP and email address. Many sites collect this kind of information for analytical purposes.

    <h2>Our use of your information</h2>

    <p>We internally use personal information of our users to statistically analyze site usage, to comply with applicable law, to improve our content and product offerings as well as to customize our site's content and layout.

    <h2>Disclosure of your information</h2>

    <p>We do not sell or rent out any personal information about you to any third party. We do disclose information in aggregate for marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose any information that could be used to personally identify you. Certain information, such as your password is not disclosed in aggregate at all.</p>
    <p>In order to maintain a healthy community, Badoo cooperates with all law enforcement inquiries and with all third parties to enforce their intellectual property or other rights.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.</p>

    <h2>Your use of other users' information</h2>

    <p>You may not use other users' information for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make unlawful threats. We reserve the right to terminate the accounts of those who misuse other users' information or who otherwise violate the <a href="http://badoo.com/terms/">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

    <h2>Inactivity</h2>

    <p>If you have not signed in to the website for 2 months, we may remove your profile as part of our data cleansing process.</p>

    <h2>Control of your password</h2>

    <p>You may not disclose your password to any third parties or share it with any third parties.

     <li>Your profile, photographs, and videos;</li>
     <li>Your city, region, and country of residence;</li>
     <li>Your password.</li>

    <p>You are entitled to ask for a copy of the information we hold about you (for which we may charge a small fee).</p>
    <p>We welcome any comments or queries you may have, so please feel free to send a message to Customer Service, including for the purposes of altering your information or changing your settings.</p>

    <p>Badoo has security measures in place to protect and prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Badoo uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information such as firewalls. While "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, our technical experts at Badoo work hard to ensure your secure use of our site.</p>

    <h2>Deleting your Profile</h2>

    <p>Users of the Badoo network have the following choices to delete their profile from our database:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Send a message to Customer Service;</li>
     <li>Sign in with your password and delete your profile. These options are available from your "Settings" page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Invite a Friend</h2>

    <p>If a user decides to use our Invitation option to invite a friend to our site, we ask them for the friend's email address. Badoo will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the website. Badoo stores this email address for the purpose of automatically associating the friend with the user sending the invitation. Badoo does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations. The friend may contact Badoo to request the removal of this information from our database.</p>
    <p>By providing us with information about a friend, you confirm that they have given you their informed consent to do so.</p>

    <h2>Uploading your Contacts</h2>

    <p>If a user decides to upload their contacts, they accept that by doing so, an email invitation will be sent on their behalf, to the email addresses of the contacts that have been uploaded and then selected to be invited. Badoo stores the name and email address of the contacts for the purpose of automatically associating the friend with the user sending the invitation. Badoo does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy or email practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage.</p>
