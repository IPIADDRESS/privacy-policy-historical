In the event there is a discrepancy between this English language version and any translated copies of the Privacy Policy, the English version shall prevail.</p> <h2 class="sm_up">What’s this all about then?</h2> <p>Hello (again, if you clicked through to here from our <a href="http://badoo.com/terms/">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>). You should read this privacy policy because it will tell you exactly how your personal data is being looked after by Badoo and that’s a pretty important thing for you to know. Here are the topics that we cover:</p> <ol> <li>What information we collect and how we collect it</li> <li>How we use the information and who we share it with</li> <li>How you can access and update such information</li> <li>How we protect the information we store about you</li> </ol> <h2 class="sm_up">Who we are</h2> <p>Badoo is operated by Badoo Trading Limited, a company registered in England at Media Village, 131 - 151 Great Titchfield Street, London, W1W 5BB, United Kingdom and company number 754025.</p> <h2 class="sm_up">The full legal bit</h2> <p>We know that other people’s use of your personal data is a big concern for social network users, so we at Badoo have developed this privacy policy (the “<b>Policy</b>”) to let you know how we use personal information (‘personal data’ or ‘personal information’).</p> <p>Our Policy applies to your use of the Badoo website at www.badoo.com (“<b>Badoo</b>”). We suggest you read it in conjunction with our <a href="http://badoo.com/terms/">Terms and Conditions of Use</a> (the “<b>Terms</b>”). When you access or use Badoo, you agree to our Privacy Policy and you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as we’ve set out in this Policy.</p> <p>Badoo reserves the right to change our Policy at any time and without notice, so be sure to check this Policy regularly to understand how we use your information.</p> <p>IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND AGREE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY THEN YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE.</p> <h2 class="sm_up_num"><span class="suni">1.</span> Badoo users and visitors to our site</h2> <h4 class="crs">What information does Badoo collect if I decide to join the Badoo social community?</h4> <p>Badoo is a meeting place for adults, and we provide that service by operating a social network site offering users the opportunity to connect to our global community of users.</p> <p>To join the Badoo network you will have to complete our online registration form, where we ask you to provide us with information about you such as your name, your email address, your gender, your date of birth, your location details. You also have the opportunity to provide other details about yourself, but these are optional. Because you control your user profile, these details are available to you at any time by accessing your “Profile” page, which gives you the chance to correct or update (other than gender and email address) your information at any time by just logging in to Badoo.</p> <p>Once you have created a Profile, we will automatically track certain information such as your IP and email addresses.</p> <h4 class="crs">What information does Badoo collect about me if I’m under 18?</h4> <p>You can only become a member of Badoo if your aged 18 or over or the age of majority in the country in which you reside if that happens to be greater than 18. That means Badoo does not knowingly collect any information about children, minors or anyone under the age of majority. Nor do we knowingly market to children, minors or anyone under the age of 18. If you are less than 18 years old, we request that you do not submit information to us. If we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal information, we will take steps to terminate that person’s registration and delete their Profile information from Badoo. If we do delete a Profile because you violated our no children rules, we may retain your email and IP address to ensure that you do not try to get around our rules by creating a new Profile.</p> <h4 class="crs">Does Badoo collect my personal information if I am not a member and just visit the site?</h4> <p>No. We don’t collect any personal information about visitors to our site. If you do visit us without becoming a member, we will place session ID cookies on your computer. For more information about cookies generally, look at the answer to “<em>How does Badoo collect information about me?</em>” below.</p> <h4 class="crs">If I put other information about me on the site, what does Badoo do with it?</h4> <p>Badoo is designed to make it easy for you to find, connect and interact with other members of Badoo by posting information about yourself.

If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">this page</a>.</p> <p>Badoo also wishes to maintain a healthy community, and we will cooperate with all law enforcement inquiries and with all third parties to enforce their intellectual property or other rights. We may also disclose your personal information to government or law enforcement agencies, or private parties, as required by law when/or, in our sole discretion, we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our legal rights, or those of third parties and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us.</p> <p>In the event that Badoo or any of its affiliates undergoes a business transition or change of ownership, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, re-organisation, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, or in the event of insolvency or administration, we may be required to disclose your personal information.</p> <h2 class="sm_up_num"><span class="suni">4.</span> Data storage</h2> <h4 class="crs">Where is my personal information kept?</h4> <p>Badoo is a global website operating through servers located in a number of countries around the world, including the United States. If you live in a country with data protection laws, the storage of your personal data may not provide you with the same protections as you enjoy in your country of residence. By submitting your personal information, or by choosing to upgrade the services you use, or by making use of the applications available on Badoo, you agree to the transfer of your personal information to, and storage and processing of your personal information in, any such countries and destinations.</p> <h2 class="sm_up_num"><span class="suni">5.</span> Security</h2> <h4>How does Badoo protect my personal information?</h4> <p>Badoo has implemented reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect and prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, including your personal information. Badoo uses reasonable security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information such as secured servers using firewalls. Our technical experts at Badoo work hard to ensure your secure use of our site.</p> <p>While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our website, member database and records no website or Internet transmission is completely secure and we cannot guarantee that unauthorised access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your password) and to log out of your account after use.</p> <p>We cannot guarantee the security of your personal data while it is being transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information we have procedures and security features in place to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p> <h4 class="crs">How do I help keep my information secure?</h4> <p>You may not disclose your password to any third parties or share it with any third parties. If you lose your password or give it out, your personal information may be compromised. If that happens, please report it to Support via <a href="http://badoo.com/feedback/">Feedback page</a>. You must change your password immediately via your “Settings” page. Badoo cannot be held responsible for your failure to keep your password secure and failure to do so may violate our <a href="http://badoo.com/terms/">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>.</p> <h2 class="sm_up_num"><span class="suni">6.</span> Your rights</h2> <h4 class="crs">How do I change my Profile?</h4> <p>You can review and revise your profile information at any time. Once you register, you will be able to review and change much of your personal information including:</p> <ol> <li>Your contact email address;</li> <li>Your profile, photographs, and videos;</li> <li>Your city, region, and country of residence;</li> <li>Your password.</li> </ol> <p>Please promptly update your information if it changes by signing-in to your account and following the screen prompts. We strongly urge you to periodically change your password to help reduce the risk of unauthorised access to your account information.</p> <p>Users in certain jurisdictions are, in accordance with applicable law, entitled to exercise a right of access to personal information about themselves by asking for a copy of the information we hold about them (for which, where allowed by law, we may charge a small fee). Please put any such request in writing and using our contact form: <a href="http://badoo.com/feedback/">Feedback</a>.</p> <h4 class="crs">Can I deactivate or delete my Profile?</h4> <p>Users of the Badoo network have the following choices to delete their profile from our database:</p> <ol> <li>Send a message via <a href="http://badoo.com/feedback/">Feedback page</a></li> <li>Sign in with your password and delete your profile. These options are available from your “Settings” page.</li> </ol> <p>If you want to stop using your account it will be initially deactivated. This means that no user will be able to search for you on the website although they may still see you profile from direct cached links, but it will not be deleted. We save your profile information in case you later decide to restore your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect us to maintain their information until they return to Badoo. You will therefore be able to restore your account and your profile in its entirety within 30 days of de-activating it.</p> <p>After the expiration of 30 days, your account is permanently deleted from Badoo. We delete photographs from our servers within 14 days from the expiration of the deactivation period while other information (such as contact history) is deleted by us over a longer timescale, by way of housekeeping on a periodic basis. You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to restore it.</p> <p>To prevent abuse and/or misuse of Badoo by a user following termination or deletion of a profile/account we shall retain such information as we deem in our sole discretion may be necessary to ensure that user does not open a new account and profile in breach of our <a href="http://badoo.com/terms/">Terms and Conditions of Use</a> and to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations.</p> <p><b>Warning:</b> Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may still be viewable and/or accessed on the Internet to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by other users or to the extent such information has been shared with search engines. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your personal information they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies.</p> <p>Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 30 days to enable restoration, but will not be available to others in the meantime.</p> <h4 class="crs">What happens if I do nothing?</h4> <p>If you have not signed in to Badoo for three months, we may remove your Profile as part of our data cleansing process.</p> <p>If you have questions about our Privacy Policy or how we collect and use information, drop us a line via <a href="http://badoo.com/feedback/">Feedback page</a>.</p> <h2>Useful links</h2> <p>You might also want to take a look at the
