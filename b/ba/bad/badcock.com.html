      <p><font size="2">Today, data is transported at 
            speeds and through avenues that in earlier years we could never have 
            imagined. But technology, with all its wonders, does not diminish 
            W.S. Badcock Corporation’s (“Badcock”) ongoing responsibility to our 
            customers. Keeping customer information secure is a top priority for 
            all of us at Badcock. At Badcock, we are dedicated to protecting 
            your privacy and handling your information in a secure and 
            confidential manner. The privacy of your information is protected 
            not only by state and federal laws, but even more importantly, by 
            Badcock's commitment to you. We know that having trust and 
            confidence in the companies you do business with is important to 
            you. And we value the trust you have placed in us to protect your

            purposes to protect customer accounts and guard against unauthorized 
            access to information. In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting 
            Act, we share customer information with reputable information
