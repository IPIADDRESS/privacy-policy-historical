This means that you IP-address, screen resolution, type browser and operating systems are sent to Google (all the normal statistics stuff). See Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></p><p>Baekdal.com fully respects your privacy. That is why we have created this privacy policy to explain what information we collect, why we do it, and how we use it. </p><p>Before we begin we would like to assure you that we will not sell, license or disclose your personal information to any third party, ever! Nor will we use the information for marketing or promotional campaigns without your explicit consent.</p><h2>Personal information we collect</h2><p>When you visit this site the following information is collected automatically:</p><h3>IP-Number (e.g. 209.194.2.184)</h3><p>It is used in our statistics reports to create summaries of visitors, hits, page views, and where our readers come from (geographically). We also collect IP-numbers in case of misuse - so that we can either report this to the authorities or prevent future access.</p><h3>Browser and Operating System</h3><p>It is used for statistics, to provide summaries of how many use each browser and how many use a particular operating system. It is also used as a way to tailor the pages. Today there is a slight difference in how the site is displayed if you use a newsreader vs. a browser. In the future we might create special versions of this site for visual impaired or for people using mobile devices. We can do this automatically by collecting this kind of information - hopefully giving you a better experience.</p><h3>What site you came from</h3><p>This is solely used to learn what external sites that links to us, thus provide visitors to this site. With this we can learn how many visitors Google provides, how many Yahoo provides or how many one of the many other sites provides.</p><h2>We also collect information in these situations</h2><h3>Commenting</h3><p>When you write a comment to an article or project you name and website is stored in the comment database. Neither needs to be supplied in order to make a comment, but if you do it will be displayed with your comment in public.</p><h3>When you write to us</h3><p>If you write to us, or call us, it will be logged in our correspondence system. The information we collect is, your name, time of contact and a short description of what we talked about. If you contact us by email, the entire email and your email address will be included. We will not store the actual telephone call.</p><h3>Newsletters</h3><p>If you signup to receive newsletters, your name, email address and what newsletter have subscribed to will be collected. This information will only be used for sending the specific newsletter and will be deleted if you unsubscribe.</p><h3>Cookies</h3><p>A global cookie is set when you visit this site. This is used in relation to our statistic system and enables us to distinguish between a visit and a hit (hits are the number of times a page is viewed). </p><h2>Your Rights</h2><h3>Right to know what we know about you</h3><p>At any time, you can ask us to provide a full and detailed list of the personal information we have on your person. Please use the contact information below - or visit our <a href="/about/contact/">contact page</a>.</p><h3>Right to tell us to delete your personal information</h3><p>At any time you can request that we delete your personal information - except correspondence. We will delete any comment you have made, any statistical information we have collected, and we will mark any correspondence as "deleted" so that it will not be used in the future (except in case of legal disputes). </p><p>Please use the contact information below - or visit our <a href="/about/contact/">contact page</a>.</p><h3>Right to tell us not to collect anything in the future</h3><p>At any time you can tell us to stop collecting more information about your person.</p><p class="note">Notice: This will cause certain parts of this site to become unavailable to you - such as commenting, tailored pages and other parts of this site that rely on personal information in order to work.
