<p><b>Information on cookies</b></p>
<p><span>Websites use smart and useful techniques to make them easier to use and more interesting for individual visitors. One of the best known techniques is to use cookies. Cookies can be used by website owners or third parties, for example advertisers, that communicate through the website being visited.</span></p>
<p><span>Cookies are small text files that the website stores in users’ computers. The information contained in cookies can also be used to track browsing of different websites that use the same cookie.</span></p>
<p><span>Cookies are classified according to duration and the site that set them.</span></p>
<p><span>Users must be informed about the cookies that our website uses and about the purposes for which they are used. There are three purposes: to ensure your privacy, make the site easy to use and optimise the development of our websites. Below is a more detailed explanation of the cookies used in our websites and their purpose.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Use of cookies by this website</span></b></p>
<p><span>This website uses cookies to collect statistical data on visitors and to record information on your preferences as you browse websites. Our purpose in using cookies is to improve the experience our site offers to visitors.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Cookies and their functionality</span></b></p>
<p><span>Different cookies are used for the various purposes.&nbsp;<br> Below is a list of the most commonly used types of cookie and the purposes for which they are used.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Session cookies</span></b><span>&nbsp;<br> Session cookies are filed temporarily in the computer’s memory while you are browsing a site, for example, to track the language chosen. Session cookies remain stored in the computer for a short period of time. They are deleted as soon as the user closes the web browser.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Permanent or tracking cookies</span></b><span>&nbsp;<br> Permanent cookies save a file on the computer for a long period of time. This type of cookie has an expiry date. Permanent cookies enable websites to remember information and settings for users’ subsequent visits, making browsing quicker and more convenient as, for example, they no longer need to log in.&nbsp;<br> On the expiry date, cookies are automatically deleted when you first access the website that created them.</span></p>
<p><b><span>First-party cookies</span></b><span>&nbsp;<br> These cookies are set by the websites themselves (with a domain that matches the domain in the browser address bar) and can be read only from these sites. They are commonly used to file information such as preferences to be used during subsequent visits to the site.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Third-party cookies</span></b><span>&nbsp;<br> These cookies are set by domains other than that indicated in the browser address bar, meaning by organisations other than the website owners.&nbsp;<br> Cookies used, for example, to collect information for advertising purposes or to customise content, as well as to process web statistics, may be third-party cookies.&nbsp;<br> Third-party cookies can be used to survey users’ browsing habits more fully and are considered more sensitive from an integrity point of view. This is why most web browsers allow settings to be changed so that these cookies are not accepted.</span></p>
<p><span>Below is a list of services used on this website that set third-party cookies:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Google Analytics (Google)</span></b><span>&nbsp;<br> Google Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google") which uses cookies to collect users’ personal data which is sent to, and stored on, Google servers in the United States. Google uses this information to track and examine your use of the website, compile reports on website activity for the website operators and provide other services related to website activity and Internet use. Google does not associate users’ IP addresses with any other data that it possesses. If you refuse to use cookies, by selecting the appropriate setting on your browser, you may not be able to use all that website’s functionality.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Social Widgets/Buttons</span></b><span>&nbsp;<br> Services that enable users to interact with social networks from within other websites.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Facebook social buttons/widgets (Facebook)</span></b><span>&nbsp;<br> Service managed by Facebook Inc., a company that has signed up to the Safe Harbor Privacy Policy Framework, guaranteeing personal data processing in line with European safety standards. The service allows users to interact with the social network through this website. If a user clicks on the button/widget, Facebook acquires data about that user’s visit to the site. Facebook does not share any information or data in its possession with the site or the data controller. For more information on Facebook Inc.’s use of personal data, please see the following link: www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation.php</span></p>
<p><b><span>Twitter social buttons/widgets (Twitter)</span></b><span>&nbsp;<br> Service managed by Twitter, a company that has signed up to the Safe Harbor Privacy Policy Framework, guaranteeing personal data processing in line with European safety standards.

For more information on Twitter’s use of personal data, please see the following link: twitter.com/privacy</span></p>
<p><b><span>Cookie management</span></b></p>
<p><span>As cookies are normal text files, they can be accessed using most text editors or word processing programs. To open them you just need to click on them. Below is a list of links that explain how to view cookies within the various browsers. If your browser is not listed, refer to the information on cookies provided by the browser. If you use a mobile phone, see the manual to find more information.</span></p>

<p><span><br> <b>Deactivating/activating or deleting cookies</b></span></p>
<p><span>Cookies can be limited or blocked depending on the browser settings.</span></p>
<p><span>If you would like websites not to store any cookies on your computer, set your browser so that it receives a notification before any cookie is filed. Alternatively, you can set your browser so that it rejects all cookies or only third-party cookies. You can also delete all cookies already present in the system. It is important to stress that settings must be edited separately in each browser and computer used.</span></p>
<p><span>If you block the storage of cookies, this website cannot guarantee that it will work properly. Some site functions may be unavailable and you may not be able to view certain websites. In addition, blocking cookies does not stop advertisements being displayed. They will simply not be customised according to your interests and may be displayed more frequently.</span></p>
<p><span>Each browser uses a different procedure for editing settings. If necessary, use the browser guide function to find the correct procedure.</span></p>
<p><span>To deactivate cookies on a mobile phone, see the manual to find more information.</span></p>
<p><span>More detailed information on cookies on the Internet can be found at http://www.aboutcookies.org/</span></p>
<p><b><span>Other cookies/unexpected cookies</span></b></p>
<p><span>Because of the way the Internet and websites work, we are not always able to control the cookies that are stored by third parties through our website. This is especially the case when webpages contain so-called incorporated elements such as text, documents, pictures or video clips that are filed elsewhere but are viewed on or through our website.&nbsp;<br> So if you find a cookie on the website that is not attributable to one of the third-party services listed, please let us know. Alternatively, you can contact the third parties concerned directly and ask for information on the cookies that they send, their purpose, their duration and how they guarantee users’ privacy.</span></p>
