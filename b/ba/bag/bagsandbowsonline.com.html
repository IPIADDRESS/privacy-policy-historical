	<br><br><strong><u>Privacy Statement</u></strong><br><br>
Bags &amp; Bows maintains a firm commitment to your privacy.  In that effort, we respect and protect the privacy of those who use our Web site, products, and services. <br><br>

This Privacy Policy, effective July 21, 2006, applies to all customer-identifiable information we obtain when a customer visits this Web site.  We have a long history of recognizing and protecting the privacy of our customers' information.  We strive to protect your privacy and utilize technology that gives you the safest and most powerful online experience available.  We want to assure you that when we ask for customer information, our goal is to improve our customer relationships.<br><br>


<strong><u>Guiding Principles of Privacy</u></strong><br><br>
<ul>
<li>Accuracy: A commitment to use reasonable procedures to ensure that information collected, used, and exchanged will be accurate and complete.
</li><li>Security: A commitment to use appropriate security measures for protecting information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.
</li><li>Compliance: A commitment to collect, use, and exchange data in accordance with applicable laws, and contractual obligations.
</li><li>Confidentiality: A commitment to collect, use, and exchange information in accordance with appropriate confidentiality standards.
</li><li>Privacy: A commitment to self-regulation in recognition of expectations of privacy, our policy, and in accordance with leading industry standards.
</li><li>Responsiveness: A commitment to respond to privacy-related inquiries in a timely and accurate manner.
</li><li>Employee Education: A commitment to educate employees regarding information practices and the proper handling and use of information.
</li><li>Self-Auditing: A commitment to periodic auditing of internal activities to ensure adherence to established information practices, policies, and procedures.<br><br>
</li></ul>

The following statements will help you understand how we collect, use, and safeguard the information you provide through our Web site.<br><br>

<strong><u>Personal Information You Choose to Provide</u></strong><br><br>

When you browse this Web site, you do so without revealing your identity.  Personal information is not collected without your awareness.  At times, we may request that you voluntarily supply personal information for purposes such as acquiring our products or services, requesting information or product samples registering on this website, or making purchases.  If you elect to participate, we may require personally identifiable information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, bank information, credit card information or email address.  When you submit personal information to us, you understand and agree that we and our affiliates may access, store, and use your personal information.  Information you provide will be protected according to our strict standards of security and confidentiality.<br><br>


<strong><u>How Collected Information is Used</u></strong><br><br>

We are committed to protecting your private information.  We use the information collected about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience.  We may also use your information to communicate with you about products, services, and future promotions.  For the purposes of check verification and fraud prevention, we exchange information about our customers internally and among our affiliates.<br><br>

We sometimes merge customer data with other data we receive from outside vendors to determine more accurate demographic consumer profiles.  The information we gather may be used to protect consumers, employees and property against fraud, theft or abuse; to conduct industry or consumer surveys; and to maintain good consumer relations.  We may selectively share customer information, including names and mailing addresses, with our affiliates.<br><br>

We do not share email addresses, but may selectively provide customer information, including names, and mailing addresses to reputable third parties (catalog mailers providing consumer products/services, direct mail marketing companies, and non-profit organizations) whose products or services we think may interest you.  If you do not want the information you provide us to be shared with nonaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes, or if you do not want to receive correspondence from us, you may opt out as described below.<br><br>


<strong><u>Security of Information</u></strong><br><br>

Security measures are in place on this Web site to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.  We offer industry-standard security measures available through your Web browser.  When you are on this Web site, the information you provide is encrypted and scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches us.  Please remember that e-mail, which is different from the encrypted sessions above, is not secure.  Therefore, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as social security or account numbers to us via an unsecured e-mail message.  Send confidential information to us via U.S. mail or phone.<br><br>

We take steps to require that our vendors, consultants, suppliers, and contractors observe our Privacy Policy with respect to security and the collection, use, and exchange of our customers' information.  They are expected to abide by the Privacy Policy when conducting work for us.<br><br>

<strong><u>Enforcement </u></strong><br><br>

<strong><u>About Registration </u></strong><br><br>
Bags &amp; Bows provides registration as a service to you, our customer.  You choose whether or not to take advantage of it. 
If you register with us, we store your information in an effort to make your ordering experience faster and easier.  After registering, you simply identify yourself with the user name and password that you have selected.  Further, our "auto-login" service allows you to automatically access your purchase history and order status without having to re-key your user name and password. <br><br>
Here is what we store for you and why: <br>
<ul>
<li>Your past purchase history -- you don't have to remember what or how much; it allows you to reorder with just one click. 
</li><li>Your purchasing information (billing, shipping contact, phone, credit card) -- frees you from re-keying the information on every order. 
</li><li>Your line of business or accounting software -- gives us the opportunity to offer promotions, products, and advice tailored to meet the needs of your business. <br><br></li></ul>

The information you provide during registration is stored in a secure database and seen only by you.  You may modify your purchasing information at any time. <br><br>
On the registration form, you may choose to receive various communications from us.  If at any time, you would like to discontinue communications (e-mails, phone calls, faxes, newsletters or advertising from our partners), you may let us know on the registration site, showing products and services that would be helpful to your business. <br><br>
