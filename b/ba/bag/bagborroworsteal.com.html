        <p>Your privacy is important to us. </p>
        <p>            Safeguarding your privacy and the security of your personal information
              is important to us. Please take a few minutes to read the following
              policy so that you understand how we treat your personal information.
              As we continuously improve and expand our services, this policy
              might change. So please check it out periodically. If you have
              questions
              about our policy, please click on our customer feedback page to
              contact us via our electronic feedback form.</p>
        <p><i><b>How we collect information about you?</b></i></p>
        <p>            We collect information in three ways:</p>
        <p>We collect information that our customers supply to us. <br>
          We collect information from emails and other contacts sent to us by
            our customers and users of our website. <br>
          We collect information electronically on all users of our website,
          including customers, by means of cookies. <br>
          Further details are provided below. </p>
        <p><i><b>What personal information we collect from our users?</b></i></p>
        <p>            When you set up an account at BagBorroworSteal.com to use our service,
              you are required to provide us with your full legal name, a valid
              credit card, email address, full street address including city,
              state and zip code, and telephone number. You must also choose
              your Username
              and Password and provide those to us. </p>
        <p>Every time you use our service, we collect information about the BagBorroworSteal.com
          products you browse and the orders you place.</p>
        <p>We collect additional information about how you use our website and
          service. <br>
          If you contact us by letter, phone, or email through the contact information
          on the "Contact Us" page, we will collect your sender information
          and may collect the other information you voluntarily disclose to us.</p>
        <p><i><b>Our use of cookies. </b></i></p>
        <p>            Like many websites on the Internet, our website uses cookies. Cookies
              are small strings of data placed on users' personal computer hard
              drives during the exchange of data that happens when your browser
              points to our website. Cookies enable a website to identify a user's
              browser as a previous visitor by means of a unique string of numbers
              assigned on a previous visit. Our cookies assist us in collecting
              information on what pages of our website you access or visit, and
              in recording any preferences you indicate on our website. We also
              use cookies to make your experience on BagBorrowOrSteal.com more
              personalized, and convenient.</p>
        <p>Our cookies cannot and do not retrieve any other data from your hard
          drive or pass on computer viruses. If you are just browsing our website,
          a cookie identifies your browser and user id (and not your identity).
          If you place orders with us, we use cookies to assist in storing your
          preferences and recording other session information (a "session" is
          a single visit by you to our website).</p>
        <p><i><b>How we store the information we collect.</b></i> </p>
        <p>            We store the information you provide to us and the information we collect
              electronically in our computer databases. We own, maintain and operate
              our computer servers containing our databases. Access to our computer
            servers is controlled by firewalls and security gatekeepers.</p>
        <p><b><i>How we use the information we collect.</i></b> </p>
        <p>            We use the personal information about you stored in our member database
              in various ways. First, the next time you use our service and enter
              your User ID and Password, we will call up your information from
            our database to make processing your order faster and easier.</p>
        <p>When you use your BagBorrowOrSteal.com account, we also keep track
          of your brand preferences and bag choices and analyze that information.
          We do so in order to be able to email to you special advertisements,
          offers and notices regarding brands and bags that seem to fit with
          your preferences.</p>
        <p>We do aggregate information about how our service is used (without
          specific identification to any particular user) to be able to improve
          our service and make it more responsive to our customers' preferences.
          We also make such aggregate information (without identification to
          any specific individual) available to our affiliates in order to obtain
          information about products, services, offers and notices which we believe
          will be useful and informative to our website users.</p>
        <p><b><i>You can control how information about you is used.</i></b> </p>
        <p>            You can also limit our communications directly to you. If you have
              a BagBorrowOrSteal.com account and do not want to receive emails
              telling you about our great deals in the future, please let us
              know. You can change your preferences, or opt out of receiving
              emails,
              at any time (except when you are in the process of placing an order)
              by going to My Account Information on the log in page. There, you
              can update your email address, phone numbers, password, address
              and you can uncheck the "Send me special offers from BagBorroworSteal.com's" box.
              Our emails to you will stop within 5 business days.</p>
        <p>BagBorroworSteal.com may from time to time send nonpromotional email
          to all registered users for the purpose of gathering and dispersing
          data to provide better services to our customers. Registered users
          will be under no obligation to reply or answer questions in said nonpromotional
          email. Nonpromotional email will include, but will not be limited to,
          surveys, maintenance notices and system updates.</p>
        <p><b><i>Our policies may change.</i></b> </p>
        <p>            This is our current privacy and security policy, but we reserve the
              right to change our website and this policy at any time. You should
              check this privacy policy periodically. If our policies regarding
              collection, storage and use of your information change, the information
              collected under prior policies will continue to be governed by those
              policies, unless we obtain your consent to use that information in
            new ways.</p>
        <p><b><i>You can access your information. </i></b></p>
        <p>            Upon your request, we will provide you with access to your unique account-related
              information and information from contacts that we maintain about
              you. In your request, please provide us with your current specific
            contact information so that we can accurately check our records.</p>
        <p><b><i>How is my information protected? </i></b></p>
        <p>            Your information is password-protected. In order to maintain this protection,
              we caution you not to provide your password to anyone. We do not
              give your password to anyone. We recommend that, if you share your
              computer with other people, you close your browser window when your
              session is completed. Signing off will protect your information if
              you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in
            a public place like a library.</p>
