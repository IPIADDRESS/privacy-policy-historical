Privacy on the BatchBlue Software web site (the “Site”) is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change this Statement and will provide notification of the change at least thirty (30) business days prior to the change taking effect.</p><h3>Safe Harbor Privacy Statement</h3><p>For personal information of customers and their contacts that BatchBlue receives from the European Economic Area and Switzerland, BatchBlue has committed to handling such personal information in accordance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. We are a self-certifying member of the U.S.-European Union and the U.S.-Switzerland Safe Harbor Frameworks and adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. Details of our registration can be found here: <a href="http://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?id=16810" target="_blank">BatchBlue’s Safe Harbor Company Profile</a>. Under the laws of the United Kingdom, we are a “data controller” in respect of the personal Information of our members but not in respect to people in your Batchbook account (the “Data”) where we act as a “data processor.”</p><h3>Information We Collect</h3><p>A. Information you provide to us: We require customers who register to use the services offered on our Site (collectively, the “Service”) to give us contact information, such as their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of users within the organization that will be using the Service. At the time you express interest in attaining additional information, or when you register for the Service, we may also ask for additional personal information, such as title, department name, fax number, or additional company information, such as annual revenues, number of employees, or industry. Customers can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked.</p><p>B. Hosted and stored Batchbook accounts. When you create or upload your Batchbook account (the “Data”), we have access to the Data in your account.</p><p>C. Other Information we receive and store. When you register to use Batchbook, we store “cookies”, which are strings of code, on your computer and they are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the Site previously. Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to BatchBlue Software, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or registering, you remain anonymous to BatchBlue Software. Cookies come in two flavors: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you’ve closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser.</p><p>BatchBlue Software uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in. This information allows BatchBlue Software to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you’ve logged in and are required in order to use the BatchBlue Software application. BatchBlue Software uses persistent cookies, which only BatchBlue Software can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a BatchBlue Software customer or prior BatchBlue Software Website visitor (whatever the case may be). We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users who disable their Web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Website but will not be able to successfully use our Service.</p><p>D. Tracking Cookies or Third Party Cookies. We may from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to our website to help us administer our website and improve its quality. Such third parties may use cookies to help track visitor behavior. Such cookies will not be used to associate individual website visitors to any personally identifiable information. All data collected by such third parties on behalf of BatchBlue Software is used only to provide us with aggregate information on site usage and is not shared with any other third parties.</p><p>E. To protect the rights and safety of our company, our employees, members and others.</p><p>F. To meet legal requirements such as complying with court orders and valid subpoenas. In the rare Customers can update or remove their personal information at any time by logging into the Website and editing their Personal Information within Setup. Customers can view their updated profile to confirm their edits have been made. Customers of the Service will be using the Site to host data and information (“Data”). BatchBlue Software will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data except as provided in the BatchBlue Software End User License Agreement, or as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the End User License Agreement, or as may be required by law. Of course, customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password. BatchBlue Software may also collect certain information from visitors to and customers of the Site, such as Internet addresses. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site in order to constantly improve the quality of the Service. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.</p><h3>Use and Disclosure of Your Information</h3><p>If you log into your Facebook account through Batchbook, we only use your Facebook credentials to identify whether contacts in your Batchbook account are “friends” [or are otherwise using Facebook]. Your private Facebook settings cannot be accessed through Batchbook by anyone, even if your Facebook Privacy Settings are set to “public.” Batchbook will only display to you common connections between your Facebook friends and your Batchbook Data. No Data or search results are retained on Batchbook and no Facebook data is pulled from your Facebook account into Batchbook. Each new log in through Facebook is a new interaction between your Batchbook Data and your Facebook friends and your status updates, photo albums, and other personal information on Facebook will never be visible to your Batchbook contacts unless they are also Facebook friends and you choose to make that information visible through your Facebook Privacy Settings. The terms of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/">Facebook Privacy Policy</a> also apply to your use of the Batchbook application through Facebook.</p><p>Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as provided for in the BatchBlue Software End User License Agreement, we do not disclose to third parties the information provided. BatchBlue will use and disclose your Information and Data only as follows:</p><p>A. To set up the Service and promote continued use of the Service.

Customers are invited to receive an email newsletter by providing an email address. Customer email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or shared with third parties. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@batchblue.com">support@batchblue.com</a>. Separately, customers are also asked to provide an email address when registering for the Service, in order to receive a username and password. We may also email information regarding updates to the Service or company. Again, email will not be distributed or shared and customers can opt out of receiving any communication by emailing <a href="mailto:support@batchblue.com">support@batchblue.com</a> at the time it is distributed, or at the time any customer registers for the Service.</p><p>B.

To help enforce compliance with our BatchBlue End User License Agreement. /eula.html</p><p>E. To protect the rights and safety of our company, our employees, our members and users and to meet legal requirements such as complying with court orders and valid subpoenas.

In exceptionally rare circumstances where national, state or company security may be at issue, BatchBlue reserves the right to share our entire database with appropriate governmental authorities.</p><p>F. To communicate with you concerning your account.</p><p>G. To transfer your Information in the event of a sale of substantially all of the assets of our business to a third party or in the event of a merger, consolidation or acquisition. However, in any such event, the acquirer will be subject to our obligations under this Privacy Policy.</p><p>H. Refer a friend. If you elect to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask you for your friend’s name and email address. BatchBlue Software will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. We do not retain or store this information.</p><h3>Your Batchbook Data</h3><p>Your Batchbook account is stored on a secure BatchBlue server. We do not contact people in your Batchbook account, or share your Batchbook account with any other party except as required by law, or as you direct us.

BatchBlue Software is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other web sites.

It is the responsibility of the user to keep such information private and confidential.</p><h3>Security</h3><p>Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. When our Site is accessed using any modern browser that supports the protocol, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that Data is safe, secure, and available only to you. BatchBlue Software also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Site in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, BatchBlue Software provides unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Data.</p><h3>Opt-Out Policy</h3><p>BatchBlue Software offers its visitors and customers a means to choose how we may use information provided. If, at any time after registering for information or ordering the Service, you change your mind about receiving information from us or about sharing your information with third parties, send us a request specifying your new choice.
