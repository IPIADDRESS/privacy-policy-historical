</p><p>

<a name="personal"></a>
<b>What personal information is collected?</b></p><p>
</p><blockquote>
Blizzard Entertainment only collects personal information on a voluntary basis. If an on-line visitor 
submits information to Blizzard Entertainment, it will usually take the form of either: (1) the 
purchase of goods or services through our on-line stores; (2) product registration or registration 
for on-line game participation; (3) player match-up services; (4) warranty registrations; (5) 
contest registrations; (6) a consumer complaint; and/or (7) surveys.  Personal information collected 
may include your name, home address, phone number, e-mail address, age, and/or birth date. We do 
not require this information to gain access to our sites, however, you will not be able to access 
certain areas that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such 
information is provided.
<p>
Visitors purchasing products or services through our on-line stores will be required to provide 
additional information such as a valid credit card number and expiration date.  
</p></blockquote>
<p>

<a name="otherinfo"></a>
<b>What other types of information may we collect?</b></p><p>
</p><blockquote>
Your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information 
regarding the capabilities of your computer to Blizzard Entertainment. Blizzard Entertainment may 
use this information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community. This information is 
never linked to you or your household in any way. 
</blockquote>
<p>

<a name="cookies"></a>
<b>What are cookies and how do you use them?</b></p><p>
</p><blockquote>
Cookies are a feature of your web browser that allows web sites to transfer bits of information to 
your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie stored on your computer can be used to "remember" 
things like your password, or that you have already registered.
<p>
Blizzard Entertainment may use cookies on its websites. This allows us to speed up your future 
activities, saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or 
registration. In addition, cookies may be used to uniquely identify the user or to retrieve user 
information for promotional or marketing purposes.  
</p></blockquote>
<p>

<a name="ip"></a>
<b>What are Internet protocol addresses?</b></p><p>
</p><blockquote>
An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service 
Provider ("ISP"). Blizzard Entertainment may track such IP addresses for system administration or to 
report aggregate information. Blizzard may also use IP addresses to limit utilization of our servers 
from any one system in an effort to prevent our servers from being abused.
</blockquote>
<p>

<a name="collect"></a>
<b>Who is collecting your information?</b></p><p>
</p><blockquote>
When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard Entertainment site, you are sharing that 
information only with Blizzard Entertainment, unless specifically stated otherwise. Some services, 
however, are provided in conjunction with partner companies. If another company other than Blizzard 
Entertainment is collecting your personal information, you will be notified at the time the 
information is collected. If do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the 
transfer of information by not using that particular service or by not providing any information at 
that time.
<p>
Please be aware that advertisers or web sites with links to our sites may collect personal 
information about you. And remember, the Blizzard Entertainment Privacy Policy does not apply to, 
and cannot control the activities of, those other advertisers or web sites. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>

<a name="personal"></a>
<b>How may my personal information be used?</b></p><p>
</p><blockquote>
The personal information you provide Blizzard Entertainment will allow us to fulfill your product or 
service order; alert you of new products, features, or enhancements; and/or notify you of upgrade 
opportunities, contests, or special events. Unless you choose otherwise, we may also provide your 
personal information to other companies or organizations that offer products that may be of interest 
to you.
<p>
Lastly, we may use your personal information for internal marketing, profiling, or demographic 
purposes, so we can adapt our products and services to better suit your needs. We do this to better 
understand and serve our customers.
</p></blockquote>
<p>

<a name="share"></a>
<b>With whom may my personal information be shared?</b></p><p>
</p><blockquote>
As a general rule, Blizzard Entertainment will not disclose any of your personal information except 
when we have your permission. However, we may need to disclose your personal information to third 
party vendors to fulfill orders or to process mailings. In special circumstances, we may also 
disclose such information if there is a violation of our End User License Agreements or our Terms 
of Service or Use Agreements or if we have a good faith belief that the law requires it.
</blockquote>
<p>

<a name="choice"></a>
<b>What choices do I have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of my personal information?</b></p><p>
</p><blockquote>
Blizzard Entertainment allows you to control the way that we use personal identifying information 
that we might obtain. At the time you provide personal information, the Blizzard Entertainment 
websites give you the option of declining any future offers or information about new products, 
promotions, or services. In addition, many of the "mailings" Blizzard Entertainment may send you, 
such as newsletters, have procedures within them to cancel the receipt of any future mailings. You 
can also contact us if you would like to change the way we use your information, e.g. if you do not 
want Blizzard Entertainment, its parent company or a affiliate company to send you e-mail or postal 
mail about our products or services.
<p>
You may contact us at Blizzard Entertainment Privacy / Opt-Out at 19840 Pioneer Avenue, Torrance, 
California 90503. You can also contact us at (800) 953-7669 or by e-mailing us at

</p></blockquote>
<p>

<a name="secure"></a>
<b>How secure is my personal information?</b></p><p>
</p><blockquote>
Blizzard Entertainment has taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure 
and in its original form, i.e. free from any alteration. As such, access to all personal information 
is strictly controlled. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to 
whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of personal information. 
</blockquote>
<p>

<a name="review"></a>
<b>What do I do if I want to correct or review my personal information?</b></p><p>
