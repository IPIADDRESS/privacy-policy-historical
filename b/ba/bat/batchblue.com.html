<h1 id="h1-privacy">Privacy Statement</h1>



						<h2><em>Effective as of October 2010</em></h2>
						<p>BatchBlue Software has created this privacy statement ("Statement")
in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy
on the BatchBlue Software web site (the "Site") is of great importance
to us. Because we gather important information from our visitors
and customers, we have established this Statement as a means to
communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices.
We reserve the right to change this Statement and will provide
notification of the change at least thirty (30) business days prior to the
change taking effect.</p>

						<h2>Safe Harbor Privacy Statement</h2>
						<p>For personal information of customers and their contacts that
BatchBlue receives from the European Economic Area and Switzerland,
BatchBlue has committed to handling such personal information
in accordance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. We are
a self-certifying member of the U.S.-European Union and the
U.S.-Switzerland Safe Harbor Frameworks and adhere to the
Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. Details of our registration can be
found here: <a href="http://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?id=10335" target="_blank">
BatchBlue's Safe Harbor Company Profile</a>.  Under the laws of the United Kingdom,
we are a "data controller" in respect of the personal Information of
our members but not in respect to people in your Batchbook account
(the "Data") where we act as a "data processor."</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
						
<p>A. Information you provide to us: We require customers who register
to use the services offered on our Site (collectively, the "Service")
to give us contact information, such as their name, company name,
address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification
and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card
number, and the number of users within the organization that will
be using the Service. At the time you express interest in attaining
additional information, or when you register for the Service, we may
also ask for additional personal information, such as title, department
name, fax number, or additional company information, such as annual
revenues, number of employees, or industry. Customers can opt out of
providing this additional information by not entering it when asked.</p>

						<p>B. Hosted and stored Batchbook accounts.

When you create or upload your Batchbook account (the "Data"), we have access to the
Data in your account.</p>
						<p>C. Other Information we receive and store. When you register to
use Batchbook, we store "cookies", which are strings of code, on
your computer and they are used to tell us whether customers and
visitors have visited the Site previously. Standing alone, cookies do
not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser.
Unless you choose to identify yourself to BatchBlue Software, either by
responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or registering,
you remain anonymous to BatchBlue Software. Cookies come in two
flavors: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only
during an online session. They disappear from your computer when
you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent
cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or
turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique
identifier for your browser.</p>
						<p>BatchBlue Software uses session cookies containing encrypted
information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are
logged in. This information allows BatchBlue Software to process your
online transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure
you are who you say you are after you've logged in and are required
in order to use the BatchBlue Software application. BatchBlue Software
uses persistent cookies, which only BatchBlue Software can read and
use, to identify the fact that you are a BatchBlue Software customer
or prior BatchBlue Software Website visitor (whatever the case may
be). We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality
of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do
not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users
who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able
to browse our Website but will not be able to successfully use our
Service.</p>
						<p>D. Tracking Cookies or Third Party Cookies. We may from time
to time engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally
identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to
our website to help us administer our website and improve its quality.
Such third parties may use cookies to help track visitor behavior. Such
cookies will not be used to associate individual website visitors to any
personally identifiable information. All data collected by such third
parties on behalf of BatchBlue Software is used only to provide us with
aggregate information on site usage and is not shared with any other
third parties.</p>

<p>E. To protect the rights and safety of our company, our employees,
members and others.</p>

<p>F. To meet legal requirements such as complying with court orders
and valid subpoenas. In the rare
Customers can update or remove their personal information at any
time by logging into the Website and editing their Personal Information
within Setup. Customers can view their updated profile to confirm their
edits have been made. Customers of the Service will be using the Site
to host data and information ("Data"). BatchBlue Software will not
review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data except as
provided in the BatchBlue Software End User License Agreement, or as
may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or
accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or
suspected violation of the End User License Agreement, or as may be
required by law. Of course, customers are responsible for maintaining
the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password.
BatchBlue Software may also collect certain information from visitors
to and customers of the Site, such as Internet addresses. This
information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to
administer our Site in order to constantly improve the quality of
the Service. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and
aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors
and customers and provide such information to third parties.</p>







						<h2>Use and Disclosure of Your Information</h2>

partners, such as promotions and events. Customers are invited to
receive an email newsletter by providing an email address. Customer
email addresses and any personal customer information will not be
distributed or shared with third parties. Customers can opt out of
being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any
time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@batchblue.com">support@batchblue.com</a>. Separately,
customers are also asked to provide an email address when registering

for the Service, in order to receive a username and password. We may
also email information regarding updates to the Service or company.
Again, email will not be distributed or shared and customers can opt

information that we collect through the Site is used solely to check the
qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for the Service. This
billing information is not used by BatchBlue Software for marketing or
promotional purposes. BatchBlue Software uses a third-party
intermediary to manage the credit card processing. This intermediary

share our entire database with appropriate governmental authorities.</p> 
<p>F. To communicate with you concerning your account.</p> 
<p>G.
To transfer your Information in the event of a sale of
substantially all of the assets of our business to a third party or in the
event of a merger, consolidation or acquisition. However, in any such
event, the acquirer will be subject to our obligations under this Privacy
Policy.</p> 
<p>H.
Refer a friend. If you elect to use our referral service for
informing a friend about our site, we ask you for your friend's name

and email address. BatchBlue Software will automatically send the
friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. We do not retain
or store this information.</p>                   
            








<h2>Your Batchbook Data</h2>

            <p>Your Batchbook account is stored on a secure BatchBlue server.
We do not contact people in your Batchbook account, or share your
Batchbook account with any other party except as required by law,

						<h2>Third-Party Sites</h2>
						<p>The Site may contain links to other web sites. BatchBlue Software
is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these
other web sites. Customers and visitors will need to check the policy
statement of these others web sites to understand their policies.
Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their
private information. It is the responsibility of the user to keep such
information private and confidential.</p>

						<h2>Security</h2>
						<p>Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the
loss, misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. When our
Site is accessed using any modern browser that supports the protocol,
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both
server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that Data
is safe, secure, and available only to you. BatchBlue Software also
implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data
and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Site in a secure
server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology
to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally,
BatchBlue Software provides unique user names and passwords that
must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help
prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the
appropriate use of Data.</p>

						<h2>Opt-Out Policy</h2>
						<p>BatchBlue Software offers its visitors and customers a means to
choose how we may use information provided. If, at any time after
registering for information or ordering the Service, you change your
mind about receiving information from us or about sharing your

information with third parties, send us a request specifying your new
choice. Simply send your request to <a href="mailto:support@batchblue.com">support@batchblue.com</a>.</p>
