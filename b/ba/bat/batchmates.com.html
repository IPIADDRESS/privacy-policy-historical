    <p align="JUSTIFY" class="fcolor4">Demographic and profile data is also
    collected at our site. We use this data to tailor your experience at Batchmates.com,
    showing content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content
    according to your preferences. We do this in two ways. First, we analyze members
    information in aggregate - that is, we collect information about thousands of site visits
    and analyze it as a whole. This kind of study involves looking for trends among many
    visitors to Batchmates.com, rather than analyzing information about any individual member.
    Examples include researching which parts of the site are accessed most frequently, or
    determining which products are most attractive to our users. Second, we may use
    information gathered during your visit to help customize our communications with you.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY" class="fcolro4">Batchmates.com may periodically conduct
    individual voluntary member surveys. We encourage our members to participate in these
    surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the
    types of services we offer, and how we provide them to you. The responses we collect in
    online surveys are anonymous. In the end, we hope to tailor our communications with you to
    fit your needs - so that you receive more of what you want from us and less of what you
    don't want.</p>
