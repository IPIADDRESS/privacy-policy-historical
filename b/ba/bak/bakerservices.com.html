One of these treats is definitely Cantucci, traditional Tuscan biscotti that are always served accompanied with Vin Santo, a deliciously sweet dessert wine that’s made from a blend of white grapes, harvested and then dried for three to six months. The traditional version is scattered with almonds, but Tuscan bakers freed their creativity and gave birth to tens of different varieties: from those covered with chocolate to the ones enriched with dried fruit.  While standard Cantucci feature wheat flour, butter and white sugar, this healthy gluten free recipe is also free from dairy and only uses a minimum amount of raw honey.  In fact, in order to keep these Cantucci allergy free, I opted for some delicious Turkish apricots and dried figs that add a touch of sweetness to these healthy biscotti and provide them with a full spectrum of flavors.
