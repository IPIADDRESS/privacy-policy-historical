              </p>
              <p><b>Information we collect</b></p>
              <p>General: Portions of bakersfield.com require visitors to provide 
                personally identifiable information that may include your name, 
                age, address, e-mail address, credit-card number and facts about

                personal information from children under the age of 13. <br>
              </p>
              <p>Surveys: We conduct periodic online surveys. For example, visitors 
                to bakersfield.com may see a pop-up window asking them to voluntarily 
                participate in a user survey. <br>
              </p>
              <p>Web site usage: We automatically collect IP addresses and web 
                site usage information from you when you visit our site. This 
                information helps us evaluate how our visitors use and navigate

              <p><b>How we use information that is collected</b></p>
              <p>Bakersfield.com may use information collected from visitors in 
                the following ways:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> To improve existing features or develop new features, products

                  <br>
                </li>
                <li> To award prizes in contests or promotions. Participation 
                  in some contests or promotions may require visitors to agree 
                  to be contacted by bakersfield.com or The Bakersfield Californian 
                  for commercial purposes, such as to subscribe to The Bakersfield 
                  Californian. <br>
                </li>

                <li> To send e-mail notifications about new or existing products 
                  and services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you. These

              <p>Bakersfield.com will not knowingly collect any personal information

                Where appropriate, bakersfield.com will specifically instruct

              </p>
              <p>Parental consent will be required in the event bakersfield.com

                or notice by postal mail. At any time, you may write to us at

                that a web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping 
                purposes. The use of cookies is common in the Internet industry, 
                and many major web sites use them to provide useful features to 
                their customers. The cookie itself does not contain any personally 
                identifying information, but may be used to tell when your computer 
                has contacted the bakersfield.com site. Bakersfield.com and its 
                affiliates use the information for editorial purposes and for 
                other purposes such as delivery of features and advertisements, 
                so that bakersfield.com can customize delivery of information 
                specific to your interests without compromising privacy. For example, 
                cookies may be used to ensure that you will not see the same ads 
                too often in a single session. We also may use cookies to save 
                your passwords so you don't have to re-enter it each time you 
                visit portions of our site. <br>

              <p><b>Registration </b><br>
              </p>
              <p>Various areas of bakersfield.com require voluntary registration. 
                These forms require you to give us personally identifiable information, 
                which may include contact information (like your name and e-mail 
                address) and unique identifiers. If you so signify beforehand, 
                we may use your contact information from the registration form 
                to send you information about our company and promotional material 
                from some of our partners. Unique identifiers are collected only 
                for use as account numbers in our record system. We do not disclose 
                any unique identifiers to any third parties. <br>
                The information collected from these registration forms is used 
                to improve existing features or develop new features, products 
                and services by analyzing how site features are being used. Such 
                information may be shared with third parties on an aggregate basis.

                part of the registration process (i.e., your ZIP code, sex, income 
                level, interest in certain topics). We may use this data to tailor 
                your experience at our site, showing you content that we think 
                you might be interested in, displaying the content according to 
                your preferences and informing you of upcoming events on our site.
