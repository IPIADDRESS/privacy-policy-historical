<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="intro">
Your privacy is important to us. We've developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose and store your information.
</p>
<h2>Collection of Personal Data</h2>
<p>
First and foremost, you will never be asked to provide any of your personal information to access our services.
</p>
<p>
We only collect your steam profile ID and the name of your account to better present data shown on the website.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h2>
<p>
We also collect non-personal information - data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer and
disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>We may collect information about your profile like number of backpack slots, which helps us determine if you are a free player or have upgraded your account. This information is used in larger graphs and cannot be linked back to you.</li>
<li>We also may collect information regarding the content of your inventory. We use this information to create complex statistics like % of total accounts that own a
specific item. This information cannot be linked directly back to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.
</p>
<h2>Cookies and Other Technologies</h2>
<p>Our website and advertisers may use "cookies" and other technologies such as pixel tag and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior,
tell us which part of our website people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by
cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the
combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Our website also uses "cookies" and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience
with our website more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your favorite "currency" can help us make this the default option when you view someone's inventory.</p>
<p>As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses,
browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
<p>We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather
demographic information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.</p>
<h2>Requesting Removal of a Specific Inventory</h2>
<p>
While we could offer a way to make an inventory private from others to see from our services, you would not be blocking every other backpack explorers that currently
exist. If you would like your inventory to be private, we strongly suggest that you specify this option from your steam profile directly. Please <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4113-YUDH-6401" target="_blank">follow this link</a>
to the steam support knowledgebase for exact instructions. This is the only safe way to have your inventory private. We do not recommend this, as it will limit your
ability to use certain 3rd party sites, but if you feel your privacy is at risk then we strongly recommend you follow these steps. It is a personal choice, after all.
</p>
<h2>Service Guarantees</h2>
<p>This is a free service with no guarantees of avaibility, secure storage and so on.</p>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice.</p>
