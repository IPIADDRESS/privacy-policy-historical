	<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

	<p><span class="brand">backup.com</span> has created this privacy statement in order to
	demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and
	dissemination practices at <span class="brand">backup.com</span>.</p>

	<p><span class="brand">backup.com</span> will not sell or rent the personally identifiable
	information of its customers.</p>

	<p><span class="brand">backup.com</span> customers uses a web-based registration form for
	customers to activate their service. We collect customer contact information (such as their
	e-mail addresses) and financial information (such as their credit card numbers). Financial
	information that is collected is used to bill the customer for products and services. Contact
	information from the registration form is used to send the customer information about our
	company, inform the customer they have protected their files, and/or we need to update the
	customer on the service. Customers may opt-out of receiving promotional contacts from <span class="brand">backup.com</span>; see the "choice/opt-out" section below. <span class="brand">backup.com</span> maintains the right to email/contact the customer for the purpose
	of administering our services. In addition to the services <span class="brand">backup.com</span>
	provides, we may run surveys and contests on our site and ask visitors for contact information
	(such as their e-mail address). We use contact data from our surveys and contests to send users
	information about our company. Users may opt-out of receiving future contacts; see the
	"choice/opt-out" section below.</p>

	<p>This site may contain links to other sites. <span class="brand">backup.com</span> is not
	responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We encourage our users to
	be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of every Web site that
	collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to
	information collected by <span class="brand">backup.com</span>. <span class="brand">backup.com</span> may disclose personal information when required by law or in the
	good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of law or
	comply with a legal process served on our Web site. The usage of cookies is in no way linked to
	any personally identifiable information by <span class="brand">backup.com</span>.</p>

	<p>We use cookies to help optimize the performance of the Web Restore feature on our software.
	Our software will function with or without the use of cookies.</p>

	<h3>Sharing</h3>

	<p>We may share aggregate demographic information with our partners. This sharing is statistical
	and does not disclose any personal information that can identify any individual person. We may
	use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill
	users for goods and services. We may partner with other parties to provide specific services.
	When a customer places an order or signs up for these services, names or other contact
	information that is necessary to provide these services may be shared between the parties. These
	parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of
	providing their specific service(s).</p>

	<h3>Notification of Changes</h3>

	<p>If any material changes are to be made in our privacy practices we will, 30 days prior to the
	changes taking effect, send a notification to the email address provided by the customer and post
	the changes in our privacy statement on our homepage. At the time of the notification, you will
	be able to opt-out of this information usage by sending a message to the following email: <a href="mailto:support@backup.com">support@backup.com</a>.</p>

	<h3>Security</h3>

	<p><span class="brand">backup.com's</span> website has security measures in place to protect the
	access, loss, misuse and alteration of the data and personally identifiable information under its
	control. The security and integrity of customer data is our business. <span class="brand">backup.com</span> employs sophisticated security measures and uses encryption
	technology like banks and the US Government. After the <span class="brand">backup.com</span>
	product is installed on the customer's PC, the "data" (from the files selected by the customer)
	and the customer's personally identifiable information are encrypted right at the customer's PC
	before being transmitted over the Internet to <span class="brand">backup.com</span>. Once <span class="brand">backup.com</span> receives the customer's transmission, it is authenticated,
	protected from the outside by a firewall and the data is stored in its encrypted form within
	<span class="brand">backup.com's</span> system. A password is required before decryption of the
	customer's data can begin. Our software never commits the customer's password to permanent
	storage (anywhere), never transmits it to <span class="brand">backup.com</span> and it cannot be
	recreated from anything the customer transmits to <span class="brand">backup.com</span>. At <span class="brand">backup.com</span>, access to customer's personally identifiable information is
	limited to e-mail addresses, contact and billing information. Even credit card information is
	kept encrypted within <span class="brand">backup.com</span>'s system.</p>

	<h3>Choice/Opt-Out</h3>

	<p><span class="brand">backup.com</span> provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
	promotional communications from us. <span class="brand">backup.com</span> maintains the right to
	communicate with users about their account. Users can remove their information from our database,
	request to not receive future promotional communications or cancel their service by emailing <a href="mailto:support@backup.com">support@backup.com</a> with the users request.</p>

	<h3>Correct/Update</h3>

	<p>Users can change or modify their information on file with use by logging into their account by
	viewing this web site or by emailing <a href="mailto:support@backup.com">support@backup.com</a>
	with their request.</p>
