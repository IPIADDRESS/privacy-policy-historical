    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
    SwapDrive has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our 
    firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information 
    gathering and dissemination practices at SwapDrive.<br>
    <br>
    SwapDrive will not sell or rent the personally identifiable information of 
    its customers.<br>
    <br>
    @Backup customers uses a web-based registration form for customers to 
    activate their service. We collect customer contact information (such as 
    their e-mail addresses) and financial information (such as their credit card 
    numbers). Financial information that is collected is used to bill the 
    customer for products and services. Contact information from the 
    registration form is used to send the customer information about our 
    company, inform the customer they have protected their files, and/or we need 
    to update the customer on the service. Customers may opt-out of receiving 
    promotional contacts from SwapDrive; see the "choice/opt-out" section below. 
    SwapDrive maintains the right to email/contact the customer for the purpose 
    of administering our services. In addition to the services SwapDrive 
    provides, we may run surveys and contests on our site and ask visitors for 
    contact information (such as their e-mail address). We use contact data from 
    our surveys and contests to send users information about our company. Users 
    may opt-out of receiving future contacts; see the "choice/opt-out" section 
    below.<br>
    <br>
    This site may contain links to other sites. Swapdrive is not responsible for 
    the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We encourage our 
    users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy 
    statements of every Web site that collects personally identifiable 
    information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected 
    by SwapDrive. SwapDrive may disclose personal information when required by 
    law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to 
    conform to the edicts of law or comply with a legal process served on our 
    Web site. The usage of cookies is in no way linked to any personally 
    identifiable information by </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">SwapDrive. We use cookies to help optimize the 
    performance of the Web Restore feature on our software. Our software will 
    function with or without the use of cookies.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Sharing</b><br>
    We may share aggregate demographic information with our partners. This 
    sharing is statistical and does not disclose any personal information that 
    can identify any individual person. We may use an outside shipping company 
    to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods 
    and services. We may partner with other parties to provide specific 
    services. When a customer places an order or signs up for these services, 
    names or other contact information that is necessary to provide these 
    services may be shared between the parties. These parties are not allowed to 
    use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing 
    their specific service(s).<br>
    <br>
    <b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
    If any material changes are to be made in our privacy practices we will, 30 
    days prior to the changes taking effect, send a notification to the email 
    address provided by the customer and post the changes in our privacy 
    statement on our homepage. At the time of the notification, you will be able 
    to opt-out of this information usage by sending a message to the following 
    email:
    <a href="mailto:support@backup.com" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
    support@backup.com</a></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><br>
    <b>Security</b><br>
    SwapDrive's website has security measures in place to protect the access, 
    loss, misuse and alteration of the data and personally identifiable 
    information under its control. The security and integrity of customer data 
    is our business. SwapDrive employs sophisticated security measures and uses 
    encryption technology like banks and the US Government. After the SwapDrive 
    product is installed on the customer's PC, the "data" (from the files 
    selected by the customer) and the customer's personally identifiable 
    information are encrypted right at the customer's PC before being 
    transmitted over the Internet to SwapDrive. Once SwapDrive receives the 
    customer's transmission, it is authenticated, protected from the outside by 
    a firewall and the data is stored in its encrypted form within SwapDrive's 
    system. A password is required before decryption of the customer's data can 
    begin. Our software never commits the customer's password to permanent 
    storage (anywhere), never transmits it to SwapDrive and it cannot be 
    recreated from anything the customer transmits to SwapDrive. At SwapDrive, 
    access to customer's personally identifiable information is limited to 
    e-mail addresses, contact and billing information. Even credit card 
    information is kept encrypted within SwapDrive's system.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Choice/Opt-Out</b><br>
    SwapDrive provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving promotional 
    communications from us. SwapDrive maintains the right to communicate with 
    users about their account. Users can &nbsp;remove their information from our 
    database, request to not receive future promotional communications or cancel 
    their service by emailing
    <a href="mailto:support@backup.com" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
    support@backup.com</a> with the users request.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Correct/Update</b><br>
    Users can change or modify their information on file with use by logging 
    into their account by visiting
    <a href="http://www.backup.com/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
    www.backup.com</a> or by emailing
    <a href="mailto:support@backup.com" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
    support@backup.com</a> with their request.</p>
