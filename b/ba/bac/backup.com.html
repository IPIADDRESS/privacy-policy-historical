To demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, SkyDesk has agreed to disclose its privacy and information practices to you, our customer and to notify you of:

<ol>

<li>What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identifiable information is collected from you through the web site 
</li><li>The organization collecting the information 
</li><li>How the information is used 
</li><li>With whom the information may be shared 
</li><li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information 
</li><li>The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under SkyDesk control

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact SkyDesk Customer Care at care@skydesk.com.<br><br>

<b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
SkyDesk has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices at SkyDesk.<br><br>

SkyDesk will not sell or rent the personally identifiable information of its customers.<br><br>

Our product uses a registration form for customers to activate their service. We collect customer contact information (such as their e-mail addresses) and financial information (such as their credit card numbers). Financial information that is collected is used to bill the customer for products and services. Contact information from the registration form is used to send the customer information about our company, inform the customer they have protected their files, and/or we need to update the customer on the service. Customers may opt-out of receiving promotional contacts from SkyDesk; see the "choice/opt-out" section below. SkyDesk maintains the right to email/contact the customer for the purpose of administering our services. In addition to the services SkyDesk provides, we may run surveys and contests on our site and ask visitors for contact information (such as their e-mail address). We use contact data from our contests to send users information about our company. Users may opt-out of receiving future contacts; see the "choice/opt-out" section below.<br><br>

This site contains links to other sites. SkyDesk is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by SkyDesk. SkyDesk may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of law or comply with a legal process served on our Web site. The usage of cookies is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information by SkyDesk. We use cookies to help optimize the performance of the Web Restore feature on our software. Our software will function with or without the use of cookies.<br><br>

<b>Sharing</b><br>
We may share aggregate demographic information with our partners. This sharing is statistical and does not disclose any personal information that can identify any individual person. We may use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. We may partner with other parties to provide specific services. When a customer places an order or signs up for these services, names or other contact information that is necessary to provide these services may be shared between the parties. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing their specific service(s).<br><br>

<b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
If any material changes are to be made in our privacy practices we will, 30 days prior to the changes taking effect, send a notification to the email address provided by the customer and post the changes in our privacy statement on our homepage. At the time of the notification, you will be able to opt-out of this information usage by sending a message to the following email: care@skydesk.com.<br><br>

<b>Security</b><br>
SkyDesk's website has security measures in place to protect the access, loss, misuse and alteration of the data and personally identifiable information under its control. The security and integrity of customer data is our business. SkyDesk employs sophisticated security measures and uses encryption technology like banks and the US Government. After the SkyDesk product is installed on the customer's PC, the "data" (from the files selected by the customer) and the customer's personally identifiable information are encrypted right at the customer's PC before being transmitted over the Internet to SkyDesk. Once SkyDesk receives the customer's transmission, it is authenticated, protected from the outside by a firewall and the data is stored in its encrypted form within SkyDesk's system. A PassPhrase (password) is required before decryption of the customer's data can begin. Our software never commits the customer's PassPhrase to permanent storage (anywhere), never transmits it to SkyDesk and it cannot be recreated from anything the customer transmits to SkyDesk. At SkyDesk, access to customer's personally identifiable information is limited to e-mail addresses, contact and billing information. Even credit card information is kept encrypted within SkyDesk's system.<br><br>

<b>Choice/Opt-Out</b><br>

This site gives users the following options for removing their information from our database, to not receive future promotional communications or to no longer receive our service.
