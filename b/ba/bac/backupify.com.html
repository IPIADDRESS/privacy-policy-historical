<p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong><br><em>Personal Information</em><br>
In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Sites and Services to you. We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily. When you register with us and create an Account, we may ask you to provide certain Personal Information, such as your name, email address and phone number. We may request additional optional information to support your access to the Sites or Services. When you communicate with us by sending us an email, we may collect and store any information that is contained in your communications with us. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Sites or Services you are able to use. Please note that if you are a Business Subscriber User, we may receive Personal Information about you from your Employer (such as your name and email address). We also collect certain Personal Information from Subscribers in order to process subscriptions, including credit card numbers and associated billing information, to charge and collect the subscription fees. We refer to this information as “<strong>Billing information</strong>”. If you are a Subscriber that has purchased the Services through one of our resellers, we may receive from them Personal Information they have collected.</p>

<p><em>Backedup Data</em><br>
The contents of Backed-up Data can include both Personal Information and Anonymous Information such as email addresses, home addresses, telephone numbers and other content communicated over email or inside contact fields, but we treat Backed-up Data differently regardless of its contents. We collect Backed-up Data that you have requested for us to collect from authorized third-party sites. If you are a Business Subscriber User, then your Employer may have designated the Backed-up Sites or authorized our services on your behalf. We will associate your Backed-up Data with your Personal Information.</p>

<p>We will access and use your Backed-up Data only when you (or, if you are a Business Subscriber User, your Employer, to the extent permitted by such Employer’s policies) grants us explicit permission to do so for troubleshooting purposes. We will not otherwise view, access or use the contents of your Backed-up Data without your written consent, but may view the related file system information (e.g., file and/or folder names, file extensions and sizes but not your file contents) to provide incremental backups and file comparisons, quality control, and technical support.</p>

<p><em>Anonymous Information</em><br>
As you use the Sites or Services, certain Anonymous Information may be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers’ server logs, such as your Internet protocol address, domain names, browser type, and access times. We may use Cookies (defined below) or web bugs and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit.</p>

<p>“<strong>Cookies</strong>” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your browser while you are viewing a website. Standing alone, Cookies do not personally identify you but merely recognize your web browser. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your browser until you delete them) to improve your experience on the Sites (e.g., by keeping you logged in). Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, you may experience session errors and may need to log-in again for each page you visit on the Sites.</p>

<p>The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>

<li>Respond to your requests, resolve disputes and/or troubleshoot problems;</li>
<li>Verify your compliance with your obligations in our Terms of Use; and</li>
<li>Communicate with you about the Sites and the Services.<br>
We may also use your Personal Information to create Anonymous Information records by excluding information that makes the information personally identifiable to you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will only use your Billing Information to process and collect fees. For the avoidance of doubt we say that the term “you” and “your” in this section includes Business Subscriber Users.</li>
</ul><p>Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected and used by others who access them.

<p><strong>THIRD PARTY SITES</strong>
The Sites may contain links to other websites. Backupify is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by us through the Sites or Services and does not apply to these third party websites. We encourage our Users to read the privacy statements of each and every website they visit. Users should always use caution and common sense when choosing to provide Personal Information on the Internet, particularly when it comes to information such as credit cards and other payment information. The ability to access information of third parties from the Sites or Services is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such third parties, their services, other websites, locations or their contents.</p>

<p><strong>SINGLE SIGN-ON</strong><br>
You can log in to our site using an Open ID provider such as Login with Google Apps. These services will
authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such
as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give
you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with
others within your network.</p>

<p><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA FEATURES AND WIDGETS</strong><br>
Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.

<p><strong>SECURITY</strong><br>
We have put in place reasonable security measures to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your Personal Information. When our Sites are accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, or Firefox version 2.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption. Backupify also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Sites in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to help prevent interference or access from outside intruders. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, and help to maintain data accuracy and appropriate use of Personal Information.</p>

<p>Despite such efforts, however, please note that no company, including Backupify, can fully eliminate risks or guarantee the security of your Personal Information; unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of information about you at any time, and we bear no liability for uses or disclosures of personal data or non-personal data arising in connection with the theft of your data.</p>
