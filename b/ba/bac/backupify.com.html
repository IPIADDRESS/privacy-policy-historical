Please note that if you are a Business Subscriber User, we may receive Personal Information about you from your Employer (such as your name and email address). We also collect certain Personal Information from Subscribers in order to process subscriptions, including credit card numbers and associated billing information, to charge and collect the subscription fees. We refer to this information as “<strong>Billing information</strong>”. If you are a Subscriber that has purchased the Services through one of our resellers, we may receive from them Personal Information they have collected.</p>
<p>
	<em>Backedup Data</em><br>
	The contents of Backed-up Data can include both Personal Information and Anonymous Information such as email addresses, home addresses, telephone numbers and other content communicated over email or inside contact fields, but we treat Backed-up Data differently regardless of its contents. We collect Backed-up Data that you have requested for us to collect from authorized third-party sites. If you are a Business Subscriber User, then your Employer may have designated the Backed-up Sites or authorized our services on your behalf. We will associate your Backed-up Data with your Personal Information.</p>
<p>
	We will access and use your Backed-up Data only when you (or, if you are a Business Subscriber User, your Employer, to the extent permitted by such Employer’s policies) grants us explicit permission to do so for troubleshooting purposes. We will not otherwise view, access or use the contents of your Backed-up Data without your written consent, but may view the related file system information (e.g., file and/or folder names, file extensions and sizes but not your file contents) to provide incremental backups and file comparisons, quality control, and technical support.</p>
<p>
	<em>Anonymous Information</em><br>
	As you use the Sites or Services, certain Anonymous Information may be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers’ server logs, such as your Internet protocol address, domain names, browser type, and access times. We may use Cookies (defined below) or web bugs and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit.</p>
<p>
	“<strong>Cookies</strong>” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your browser while you are viewing a website. Standing alone, Cookies do not personally identify you but merely recognize your web browser. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your browser until you delete them) to improve your experience on the Sites (e.g., by keeping you logged in). Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, you may experience session errors and may need to log-in again for each page you visit on the Sites.</p>
<div>
	<strong>USE OF INFORMATION</strong><br>
	<em>Personal Information</em><br>
	<span>We will use your Personal Information to:</span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Administer your Account;</li>
		<li>
			Provide you with Services and customer support;</li>
		<li>
			Tailor the features of the Sites or Services to you;</li>

		<li>
			Verify your compliance with your obligations in our Terms of Use; and</li>
		<li>
			Communicate with you about the Sites and the Services.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<p>
	We may also use your Personal Information to create Anonymous Information records by excluding information that makes the information personally identifiable to you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will only use your Billing Information to process and collect fees. For the avoidance of doubt we say that the term “you” and “your” in this section includes Business Subscriber Users.</p>
<p>
	Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@backupify.com">privacy@backupify.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
<p>
	We send administrative emails which pertain to the Sites and Services on a regular basis, and you may not opt-out of these emails. If you wish to not receive these emails, you must terminate your Subscription and cease use of the Services.</p>
<p>
	<em>Anonymous Information</em><br>

<p>
	<strong>THIRD PARTY SITES</strong><br>
	The Sites may contain links to other websites. Backupify is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by us through the Sites or Services and does not apply to these third party websites. We encourage our Users to read the privacy statements of each and every website they visit. Users should always use caution and common sense when choosing to provide Personal Information on the Internet, particularly when it comes to information such as credit cards and other payment information. The ability to access information of third parties from the Sites or Services is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such third parties, their services, other websites, locations or their contents.</p>
<p>
	<strong>REGARDING CHILDREN</strong><br>
	The Sites are not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Services. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under 13 years old, and no part of the Sites or Services is designed to attract people under 13 years old. If we later obtain actual knowledge that a User is under 13 years old, we will take steps to remove that User's Personal Information from our databases immediately.</p>
<p>
	<strong>SECURITY</strong><br>
	We have put in place reasonable security measures to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your Personal Information. When our Sites are accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, or Firefox version 2.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption. Backupify also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Sites in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to help prevent interference or access from outside intruders. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, and help to maintain data accuracy and appropriate use of Personal Information.</p>
<p>
	Despite such efforts, however, please note that no company, including Backupify, can fully eliminate risks or guarantee the security of your Personal Information; unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of information about you at any time, and we bear no liability for uses or disclosures of personal data or non-personal data arising in connection with the theft of your data.</p>
<p>

	Users who would like to update, delete inaccuracies, or change information associated with their Account may do so at any time by editing their Account profile online or by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:support@backupify.com">support@backupify.com</a>. If you change and/or request changes to your information, subsequent uses or disclosures of that information by us will reflect those changes. Please note, however, that we do not have the ability to update any information previously disclosed to any third party. Certain information is necessary in order for us to provide the Sites or Services; therefore, if you delete such necessary information you may not be able to use the Sites or Services. We will respond to your access request within 30 days.</p>
<p>
	Users can request a copy of their Backed-up Data by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@backupify.com">support@backupify.com</a>. For your protection, Users will be required to provide proof of identity to obtain a copy of their Backed-up Data.</p>

Within a reasonable time period after we receive your request, we will remove your Personal Information and/or Backed-up Data. Please note, however, that even though you may request the deletion of your Personal Information or Backed-up Data by us, we may be required (by law or otherwise, such as to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, or enforce our Terms of Services) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time) in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).
