          Backupify, Inc. (“<strong>Backupify</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” or “<strong>our</strong>”)
          has created this privacy statement (“<strong>Privacy Statement</strong>”) in order to demonstrate our
          commitment to you, our user, (“<strong>you</strong>” or “<strong>your</strong>”) regarding your privacy with
          respect to information that you submit to Backupify by or through the Sites or Services (defined below), whether
          you are a “<strong>Visitor</strong>” (which means that you simply browse a Site), a “<strong>Subscriber</strong>”
          of Backupify (which means you have either registered with Backupify and established an Account or otherwise
          entered into a separate agreement with Backupify, with respect to the Sites and/or Services), or you are an
          employee, contractor or agent of a Subscriber that uses the Services for commercial purposes (a “<strong>Business
          Subscriber User</strong>”), using the Sites or Services in your capacity as an employee, contractor or agent of
          that Backupify Subscriber. Visitors, Subscribers and Business Subscriber Users are individually referred to as
          a “<strong>User</strong>,” and collectively, as “<strong>Users</strong>”.
        </p>

        <p>
          A Subscriber that is a business, organization or an individual that is using the Services for commercial
          purposes (entities referred to as Business Subscribers in our Terms of Service) may control certain or all
          aspects of its Business Subscriber User’s Accounts.  In order to make this Privacy Policy more readable, we
          refer to a Business Subscriber as an “<strong>Employer</strong>” with the understanding that the defined term
          may not be technically accurate in all cases.
        </p>

        <p>
          Privacy on backupify.com and other sites we operate (each, a “<strong>Site</strong>”) is of great
          importance to us. Because we gather important information from our Users of the Sites and related services
          provided by Backupify (the “<strong>Services</strong>”), we have established this Privacy Statement as a means
          to communicate our information collection, use and dissemination practices. In order to access and use the
          Sites and/or Services, you must agree to our Terms of Service. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy
          Statement will have the meaning ascribed to them in the Terms of Service.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong>
          <br>
          This Privacy Statement describes Backupify’s use of Personal Information and Anonymous Information (each as
          defined below) that we collect from your use of, or access to, the Sites and Services, whether you are an
          individual or a company, as well as information we may use to update the information you provide us through
          other means. “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means contact information (i.e., your name, address,
          email address, and/or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be
          used to personally identify an individual. “<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>” means information that is
          not used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual. “<strong>Backedup Data</strong>” means
          data and other files that exist on third-party websites that you designate for us to backup as part of the
          Services.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            BY USING OUR SITE OR SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SITE OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO
            THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT AND YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
            ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT
            WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF
            PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong>
          <br>
          <em>Personal Information</em>
          <br>
          In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Sites and Services to you. We collect
          Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily. When you register with us and create an Account, we
          may ask you to provide certain Personal Information, such as your name, email address and phone number. We may
          request additional optional information to support your access to the Sites or Services. When you communicate
          with us by sending us an email, we may collect and store any information that is contained in your
          communications with us. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the
          features of the Sites or Services you are able to use. Please note that if you are a Business Subscriber User,
          we may receive Personal Information about you from your Employer. We also collect certain Personal Information
          from Subscribers in order to process subscriptions, including credit card numbers and associated billing
          information, to charge and collect the subscription fees. We refer to this information as “<strong>Billing
          information</strong>”. If you are a Subscriber that has purchased the Services through one of our resellers,
          we may receive from them Personal Information they have collected.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Backedup Data</em>
          <br>
          The contents of Backedup Data can include both Personal Information and Anonymous Information, but we treat
          Backedup Data differently regardless of its contents. We collect Backedup Data that you have requested for us
          to collect from authorized third-party sites. If you are a Business Subscriber User, then your Employer may
          have designated the Backedup Sites or authorized our services on your behalf. We will associate your Backedup
          Data with your Personal Information.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Anonymous Information</em>
          <br>
          As you use the Sites or Services, certain Anonymous Information may be passively collected and stored on our
          or our service providers’ server logs, such as your Internet protocol address, domain names, browser type,
          and access times.  We may use Cookies (defined below) or web bugs and navigational data like Uniform Resource
          Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit. “<strong>Cookies</strong>”
          are small pieces of information that a website sends to your browser while you are viewing a website. Standing
          alone, Cookies do not personally identify you but merely recognize your web browser.  We may use both session
          Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your browser
          until you delete them) to improve your experience on the Sites (e.g., by keeping you logged in).  Persistent
          Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions.  If you choose to disable
          Cookies, you may experience session errors and may need to log-in again for each page you visit on the Sites.
        </p>

        <div>
          <strong>USE OF INFORMATION</strong>
          <br>
          <em>Personal Information</em>
          <br>
          <span>We will use your Personal Information to:</span>
          <ul class="with_icon">
            <li>Administer your Account;</li>
            <li>Provide you with Services and customer support;</li>
            <li>Tailor the features of the Sites or Services to you;</li>
            <li>Respond to your requests, resolve disputes and/or troubleshoot problems;</li>
            <li>Verify your compliance with your obligations in our Terms of Use; and</li>
            <li>Communicate with you about the Sites and the Services.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          We may also use your Personal Information to create Anonymous Information records by excluding information
          that makes the information personally identifiable to you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will only use
          your Billing Information to process and collect fees. For the avoidance of doubt we say that the term “you”
          and “your” in this section includes Business Subscriber Users.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please be aware that if you enter any Personal Information into publicly available sections of the Sites or
          Services, that information will be displayed to all persons with current access to these sections.
        </p>

        <p>
          We send administrative emails which pertain to the Sites and Services on a regular basis, and you may not
          opt-out of these emails. If you wish to not receive these emails, you must terminate your Subscription and
          cease use of the Services.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Backedup Data</em>
          <br>
          We will access and use your Backedup Data only when you (or, if you are a Business Subscriber User, your
          Employer, to the extent permitted by such Employer’s policies) grants us explicit permission to do so for
          troubleshooting purposes. We will not otherwise view, access or use the contents of your Backedup Data without
          your written consent, but may view the related file system information (e.g., file and/or folder names, file
          extensions and sizes but not your file contents) to provide incremental backups and file comparisons, quality
          control, and technical support.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Anonymous Information</em>
          <br>
          We may, through our use of Cookies, keep you logged into the Site during each session. We may also customize
          Site content to your interests and otherwise personalize your use of the Site. We may also use your Anonymous
          Information to improve our internal operations and software.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</strong>
          <br>
          <em>Personal Information</em>
          <br>
          It is our general policy to restrict who can access Personal Information. Except as otherwise stated in this

          a common control (collectively, “affiliates”), it may in the future.  We may share some of all of your Personal
          Information with these affiliates, in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Statement.

          Sites or Services.

          <br>
          If you provide feedback to us, we may use and disclose such feedback in accordance with the terms in our Terms
          of Service, provided we do not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. We will collect any

        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>THIRD PARTY SITES</strong>
          <br>
          The Sites may contain links to other websites. Backupify is not responsible for the privacy practices or the
          content of these other websites. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by us through
          the Sites or Services and does not apply to these third party websites.  We encourage our Users to read the
          privacy statements of each and every website they visit.  Users should always use caution and common sense
          when choosing to provide Personal Information on the Internet, particularly when it comes to information such
          as credit cards and other payment information. The ability to access information of third parties from the
          Sites or Services is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such third parties, their
          services, other websites, locations or their contents.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>REGARDING CHILDREN</strong>
          <br>
          The Sites are not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Services.  Protecting the
          privacy of children is very important to us.  We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people
          we actually know are under 13 years old, and no part of the Sites or Services is designed to attract people
          under 13 years old.  If we later obtain actual knowledge that a User is under 13 years old, we will take steps
          to remove that User's Personal Information from our databases.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>SECURITY</strong>
          <br>
          We have put in place reasonable security measures to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of
          your Personal Information. When our Sites are accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, or Firefox
          version 2.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication
          and data encryption. Backupify also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded
          session identifications, and hosts the Sites in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other
          advanced technology to help prevent interference or access from outside intruders. These safeguards help
          prevent unauthorized access, and help to maintain data accuracy and appropriate use of Personal Information.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite such efforts, however, please note that no company, including Backupify, can fully eliminate risks or
          guarantee the security of your Personal Information; unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure,
          and other factors may compromise the security of information about you at any time, and we bear no liability
          for uses or disclosures of personal data or non-personal data arising in connection with the theft of your data.

          <strong>CORRECTING &amp; UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION</strong>
          <br>
          Users who would like to update or change information associated with their Account may do so at any time by
          editing their Account profile online or by sending us an email at
          <a href="mailto:support@backupify.com">support@backupify.com</a>. If you change and/or request changes
          to your information, subsequent uses or disclosures of that information by us will reflect those changes.
          Please note, however, that we do not have the ability to update any information previously disclosed to any
          third party.  Certain information is necessary in order for us to provide the Sites or Services; therefore,
          if you delete such necessary information you may not be able to use the Sites or Services.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users can request a copy of their Backedup Data by emailing us at

          the Services, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@backupify.com">support@backupify.com</a> or
          call (1-800-571-4984). Within a reasonable time period after we receive your request, we will remove your
          Personal Information and/or Backedup Data.   Please note, however, that even though you may request the
          deletion of your Personal Information or Backedup Data by us, we may be required (by law or otherwise, such
          as to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, or enforce our Terms of Services) to keep this
          information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time) in which case we will comply
          with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).  When we delete Personal
          Information or Backedup Data, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives.
