	Backupify, Inc. (“<strong>Backupify</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us,</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>”) has created this privacy statement (“<strong>Privacy Statement</strong>”) in order to demonstrate our commitment to you, our user, (“<strong>you</strong>” or “<strong>your</strong>”) regarding your privacy with respect to information that you submit to Backupify by or through the Site (www.backupify.com) or Services (defined below), whether you are a “<strong>Visitor</strong>” (which means that you simply browse a Site), a “<strong>Subscriber</strong>” of Backupify (which means you have either registered with Backupify and established an Account or otherwise entered into a separate agreement with Backupify, with respect to the Sites and/or Services), or you are an employee, contractor or agent of a Subscriber that uses the Services for commercial purposes (a “<strong>Business Subscriber User</strong>”), using the Sites or Services in your capacity as an employee, contractor or agent of that Backupify Subscriber. Visitors, Subscribers and Business Subscriber Users are individually referred to as a “<strong>User</strong>,” and collectively, as “<strong>Users</strong>”.</p>
<p>
	A Subscriber that is a business, organization or an individual that is using the Services for commercial purposes (entities referred to as Business Subscribers in our Terms of Service) may control certain or all aspects of its Business Subscriber User’s Accounts. In order to make this Privacy Statement more readable, we refer to a Business Subscriber as an “<strong>Employer</strong>” with the understanding that the defined term may not be technically accurate in all cases.</p>
<p>
	Privacy on backupify.com and other sites we operate (each, a “<strong>Site</strong>”) is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information from our Users of the Sites and related services provided by Backupify (the “<strong>Services</strong>”), we have established this Privacy Statement as a means to communicate our information collection, use and dissemination practices. In order to access and use the Sites and/or Services, you must agree to our Terms of Service. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Statement will have the meaning ascribed to them in the Terms of Service.</p>
<p>
	<strong>SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong><br>
	This Privacy Statement describes Backupify’s use of Personal Information and Anonymous Information (each as defined below) that we collect from your use of, or access to, the Sites and Services, whether you are an individual or a company, as well as information we may use to update the information you provide us through other means. “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means contact information (i.e., your name, address, email address, and/or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual. “<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>” means information that is not used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual. “<strong>Backedup Data</strong>” means data and other files that exist on third-party websites that you designate for us to backup as part of the Services.</p>

<p>
	<strong>INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong><br>
	<em>Personal Information</em><br>
	In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Sites and Services to you. We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily. When you register with us and create an Account, we may ask you to provide certain Personal Information, such as your name, email address and phone number. We may request additional optional information to support your access to the Sites or Services. When you communicate with us by sending us an email, we may collect and store any information that is contained in your communications with us. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Sites or Services you are able to use. Please note that if you are a Business Subscriber User, we may receive Personal Information about you from your Employer (such as your name and email address). We also collect certain Personal Information from Subscribers in order to process subscriptions, including credit card numbers and associated billing information, to charge and collect the subscription fees. We refer to this information as “<strong>Billing information</strong>”. If you are a Subscriber that has purchased the Services through one of our resellers, we may receive from them Personal Information they have collected.</p>
<p>
	<em>Backedup Data</em><br>
	The contents of Backed-up Data can include both Personal Information and Anonymous Information such as email addresses, home addresses, telephone numbers and other content communicated over email or inside contact fields, but we treat Backed-up Data differently regardless of its contents. We collect Backed-up Data that you have requested for us to collect from authorized third-party sites. If you are a Business Subscriber User, then your Employer may have designated the Backed-up Sites or authorized our services on your behalf. We will associate your Backed-up Data with your Personal Information.</p>
<p>
	We will access and use your Backed-up Data only when you (or, if you are a Business Subscriber User, your Employer, to the extent permitted by such Employer’s policies) grants us explicit permission to do so for troubleshooting purposes. We will not otherwise view, access or use the contents of your Backed-up Data without your written consent, but may view the related file system information (e.g., file and/or folder names, file extensions and sizes but not your file contents) to provide incremental backups and file comparisons, quality control, and technical support.</p>
<p>
	<em>Anonymous Information</em><br>
	As you use the Sites or Services, certain Anonymous Information may be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers’ server logs, such as your Internet protocol address, domain names, browser type, and access times.

	authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such<br>
	as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give<br>

	We have put in place reasonable security measures to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your Personal Information. When our Sites are accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, or Firefox version 2.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption.

These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, and help to maintain data accuracy and appropriate use of Personal Information.</p>
