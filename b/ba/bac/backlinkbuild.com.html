This policy covers the identifiable information of prospective, current, or former customers.</p>

<h3>Privacy Principles</h3>
<p>The following data privacy principles form the foundation of the “Backlinkbuild” Data Privacy Policy.  As such, “Backlinkbuild” will monitor the implementation of and adherence to these principles through appropriate management and controls on an ongoing basis. </p>

Notice options will be provided as required by applicable laws and/or upon customer request. </p>

<h4>2.	3rd Party Transfer </h4>
<p class="numberp">“Backlinkbuild” is committed to protecting any sensitive data.  Sensitive data regarding our customers will be transferred to third parties for processing outside of “Backlinkbuild” only if the receiving party abides by privacy practices that provide an equivalent level of protection to these privacy policies.   3rd party transfers of customer data are to be limited to only those transfers necessary to facilitate the provision of the agreed services of “Backlinkbuild.”</p>

<h4>3.	Security </h4>

<p class="numberp">Wherever sensitive information (such as credit card data) is collected, that information is encrypted and transmitted in a secure way.  You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.  “Backlinkbuild” only utilizes 3rd party payment processing services that support comprehensive data retention security capabilities, such as PayPal® and information about that security can be referenced at: https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_security-center</p>
