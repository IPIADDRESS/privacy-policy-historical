<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>backpage.com (the "Site") respects your privacy. Here's our privacy policy for this Site:</p>

<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

<p>The Site will not provide our advertisers or anyone else outside the Site with any information specific to you collected from the Site unless we have your consent. The only Site employees or consultants allowed access to personal information about you are those who need to have access. Any employee or consultant who violates our privacy and security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination or prosecution.</p>

<h3>What Information is Collected and Used:</h3>

<p>We will not release your name, e-mail address or any other personal information to anyone else outside the Site unless we have your consent. However, we may disclose your personal information if (i) required to do so by law, court order or subpoena, or as requested by other government, law enforcement, or investigative authority, (ii) we in good faith believe that such disclosure is necessary or advisable, including without limitation to protect the rights or properties of the Site, (iii) we have reason to believe that disclosing your personal information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, or has breached an agreement, or if anyone else could be harmed by such activities or interference, (iv) if we determine an ad posted violates our terms of use or the rights of a third party, or (v) there is an emergency involving personal danger.</p>

<p>Please note that if you post any of your personal information on the Site, such information may be collected and used by others over whom the Site has no control. The Site is not responsible for the use by third parties of information you post or otherwise make public.</p>
