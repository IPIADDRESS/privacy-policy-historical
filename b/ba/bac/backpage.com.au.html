  You authorize the Site to transmit email to you to respond to your communications and administer Activities.<br><br>


<p><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Children</strong><br><br>

  The Site is not intended for children under the age of 13 nor does the Site knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The 

Site does not orient this Site toward children or target them as an audience, nor does it screen them from using the Site. Some of the material

but it does not operate, control or endorse such sites. The Site also disclaims any responsibility for the information on those sites and any 

products or services offered there, and cannot vouch for the privacy policies of such sites. The Site does not make any warranties or 

representations that any linked sites (or even this Site) will function without error or interruption, that defects will be corrected, or that 

the sites and their servers are free of viruses and other problems that can harm your computer.<br><br>

  <strong>E-Commerce and Our Secure Server</strong><br><br>

  We understand that storing data in a secure manner is important.&nbsp; We store personal information using industry standard, reasonable and 

technically feasible, physical, technical and administrative safeguards against foreseeable risks, such as unauthorized access.&nbsp; All 

commerce transactions that take place on the Site are processed through our secure server in order to make every reasonable effort to insure that 

your personal information is protected. <br><br>
  Please be aware that the Site and data storage are run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, 

require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond the Site’s control.&nbsp; We cannot guarantee the security of the 

information on and sent from the Site.&nbsp; <br><br>
  On our Site, you may have the opportunity to follow a link to other sites that may be of interest to you.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the 

privacy practices of those sites or the content provided thereon.&nbsp; We disclaim any responsibility for transactions conducted on those sites 

and cannot vouch for the security of the information submitted in those transactions. <br><br>

  <strong>Policy Changes and Acceptance</strong><br><br>

  The Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time as we add new features and services, as laws change, and as industry privacy and security 

best practices evolve.&nbsp; We display an effective date on the upper left corner of the Privacy Policy so that it will be easier for you to 

know when there has been a change. Accordingly, you should check the Privacy Policy on a regular basis for the most current privacy 

practices.&nbsp; Each time you access, use or browse the Site, you signify your acceptance of the then-current changes to the Privacy Policy 

applying to your personal information collected by us on and from the effective date of such changes.&nbsp; <br><br>
  Any changes in the Privacy Policy will take effect upon posting and apply only to information collected from you on and after Last Revised 

date, unless we provide notice or have other communications with you.&nbsp; <br><br>
