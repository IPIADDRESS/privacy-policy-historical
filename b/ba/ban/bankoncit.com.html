<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>
       Last Updated: September 26, 2011
    </h2>
    <p>
       <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
       CIT Group Inc. and its affiliates (collectively "CIT," "we," "us," or "our") respect your privacy and we are committed to treating and using personal information about you responsibly.
    </p>
    <p>
       This Online Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains CIT's online practices to collect, use and share personal information from or about you when you visit this site and any CIT site that links to this Policy, except as otherwise provided in this Policy. Throughout this Policy, we refer to the nonpublic personal information that identifies you or your accounts as "personal information." "Personal information" includes information about you that is personally identifiable, such as your name, address, email address, or phone number and other information that is not otherwise publicly available (such as your date of birth, Social Security number and financial information). This Policy does not apply to information collected by CIT from its customers to password-protected sections of this or any other CIT site unless such password-protected section has a Privacy button or tab that links to this Policy. Please read this Policy carefully. When you visit this site you consent to the terms of this Policy and the information described herein.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>Information we collect</strong><br>
       We collect personal information from and about you in order to identify you as our customer, establish and manage customer accounts, complete customer transactions, understand customer needs, market products and services, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       We may also collect personal information from you if you:
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
       (1) apply for employment through this site (which may include your name, address, references and employment history);
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
       (2) use this site to check the status of your accounts (such as your name, account number and login password); and
    </p>
    <p class="indent expand">
       (3) send us an email to inquire about your account or to request information (such as your name, email address and any other personal information you supply in your message).
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>Information we automatically collect</strong><br>
       When you visit the CIT site, we automatically collect certain nonpersonal information, such as "cookies." A cookie is a unique identifier that allows us to recognize your computer each time you visit our site. Cookies can help us improve your use of our site, for example, by providing quick login, streamlining navigation and maintaining up-to-date content for all users. Should you configure your browser to reject cookies, you may disable some of our site's features. Cookies don't contain personal information, nor can they read or transmit any data on your computer's hard drive.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>Children</strong><br>
       CIT operates general audience web sites that are accessible by the public. This website is not intended for visitors under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about children, nor do we knowingly market our products or services to children.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>Foreign non-United States users</strong><br>
       If you are visiting this site from outside the United States, please do not provide any personal information through this site or by email, as this Privacy Policy may not comply with your local law. Please consult CIT websites established in your jurisdiction instead. For CIT Privacy Policies that apply to non-U.S. locations, <!--TRANSIT - HYPERLINK--><!--.http://www.cit.com/utility/privacy-policy/non-us/index.htm.--><a href="http://www.cit.com/utility/privacy-policy/non-us/index.htm" target="_top">click here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>How we use the information we collect</strong><br>
       We may use the personal information that you provide to us as follows:
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
       (1) if you apply for a job, to consider you for the position and to contact references; or
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
       (2) if you apply for credit, to assess your creditworthiness including retrieving credit reports and to approve or reject your application; or
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
       (3) to respond to inquiries you may have about your account and other related matters; or
    </p>
    <p class="indent expand">
       (4) if you send us an email for information, to reply to your request.
    </p>
    <p>
       We may also use the personal information that you provide to help us improve the content and function of this or other CIT sites, better understand our customers and markets, improve our products and services, enhance our marketing efforts, improve our product offerings, and to later contact you, electronically or otherwise, about products or services that we believe may interest you.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>How we may share information you provide to us</strong><br>
       CIT may share personal information that you provide under the following circumstances:
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong class="gray">Affiliates:</strong> We may share your name, address and information about your transactions and experiences with us (such as your payment history or other facts about your account) with our affiliates.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong class="gray">Agents and service providers:</strong> To establish, administer, and manage our customers' accounts, evaluate credit, provide customer service and benefits, process account transactions and account statements, or process job applications, we may disclose your personal information to companies that work with us to perform services or business operations on our behalf. We may also share your personal information with companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, or with other financial institutions (including insurance companies) with whom we have joint marketing agreements.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong class="gray">Nonaffiliated third parties:</strong> In certain instances, we are permitted or even required to disclose your personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. For example, reporting your transaction history and information with us to credit reporting agencies, responding to regulators or auditors, to protect against fraud, or to provide information in connection with proposed or actual business transactions involving CIT companies or accounts. We may also disclose your personal information to third parties when legally compelled to do so, such as to comply with the law, to enforce our terms of use, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of CIT, its employees, customers, visitors to this site, and others. Please be aware that these disclosures are permitted by law without your consent.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong class="gray">Other third parties:</strong> We may also share, as permitted by law, your personal information with other third parties with whom we do not have joint marketing agreements, such as other financial services providers, insurance companies, or with nonfinancial companies such as service organizations, retailers, travel services and direct marketers. We require these companies to adhere to CIT's confidentiality standards with respect to your personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong class="gray">USA Patriot Act Section 326 compliance:</strong> When you open an account with us, we will ask for your name, address, and other identifying documents such as your driver's license, that will allow us to identify you. We do this to help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities. U.S. federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong class="gray">Business transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we may sell or buy businesses or assets, or be involved in mergers or other corporate reorganization. In transactions such as these, your personal information may be shared in connection with any of the foregoing types of transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>How we protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information</strong><br>
       CIT uses reasonable measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access, deletion or alteration. In addition, we have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal and state regulations to protect your personal information. As part of our security practices, CIT does not send requests for personal information to our customers. Certain personal information that CIT transmits to you by email at your request, such as your account balance, is encrypted. Standard email communications are not encrypted. Therefore, you should not transmit your personal information to us through email.
    </p>

       <strong>Online Security Tips</strong><br>
       CIT is committed to ensuring the security of the websites it operates and our systems. We also feel that you, as the end-user, should also ensure that you are adequately protected when you use the Internet. To that end, we recommend the following security best practices:
    </p>
    <p class="close">
       • Install anti-virus, anti-spyware and other Internet security software on your PC. Use it regularly and keep it up-to-date.
    </p>
    <p class="close">
       • Regularly update your PC's operating system and Web browser software with the vendor's software patches and updates to protect your PC against known vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p class="close">
       • Do what you can to prevent unauthorized people from using your PC.
    </p>
    <p class="close">
       • Change your passwords often.
    </p>
    <p class="close">
       • If you notice suspicious activity in your accounts, report it immediately to the appropriate parties.
    </p>
    <p class="close">
       • Do not download or open any attachments sent to you by unsolicited email as they may contain malicious programs that can compromise your PC's security, once opened.
    </p>
    <p class="expand">
       • Be on the alert for phishing scams that ask for your personal information for fraudulent purposes. Access websites by typing the Web addresses directly into your Web browser or by using Web addresses you have bookmarked, instead of via embedded links in unsolicited emails.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><br>
       CIT may update this Policy from time to time. You should periodically check the effective date at the top of this webpage to be sure that you are aware of the most recent version of this Policy and the important information described in it.
    </p>
