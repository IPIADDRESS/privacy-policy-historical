            <p>Banner Play Ltd. (“we, our or us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and
                procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive when you visit
                the bannerplay.com site (the “Site”) and when you use any part of our service or software via our Site or on
                the websites of our partners or other third parties (collectively, the “Service”). This Privacy Policy applies
                only to information that you provide to us through the Service when you access, download, purchase or use
                any information, services, products or content appearing on the Site or offered by us through the Service, or
                that we collect on your behalf as part of the Service.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be amended or updated from time to time. If we make any material changes to this
                Privacy Policy, we will post a notice of these changes on our website and in this Privacy Policy. You are
                advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.</p>
               <div class="title">
               <span>1.</span>
                <h2> Information Collection</h2>
            </div>
            <h3>Personally Identifiable Information.</h3>
            <p>In the course of using the Services, we will ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account (“Personal Information”). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, country of residence, email address, financial information, and website address.</p>
            <h3>Non Personally Identifiable Information.</h3>
            <p>When you access the Site or use the Service, (whether such use is performed on the Site or on a website of one of our partners or other third parties), we collect the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Information regarding your use of the Service, including without limitation, the subject of your query, the search engines that you use and all information collected by us in performing the Service for you (“Analytical Data”);</li>
                <li>Information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or online service (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include, but is not limited to, your computer’s Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to the Site and information you search for on the Site;</li>
                <li>When you use a widget or any other tool offered by us, whether on the Site or on a third party website, including a website owned or operated by you, we may record data related to that activity, the deployment of the widget or tool and any other account related data;</li>
                <li>Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use “persistent cookies” to save your username and login password for future logins to the Site. We use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor web traffic routing on the Site and aggregate usage of the Services. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the website you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services.</li>
                <li>Third party websites which may advertise on the Site and other third parties that you interact with through your use of the Service may also place or read cookies on your computer’s browser, which enables them to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements and content. The collection and use of such information and access of any third party websites are subject to such third party’s privacy policy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Information Collected From Others.</h3>
            <p>We and our licensors allow you to place certain scripts and code which it has developed for installation and
                use on your website, so that certain BannerPlay applications can be used and accessed by visitors to your
                website. If you install and deploy an application made available by us, such as a widget (the
                “Application”), on a website and/or provide the Application for a third party to place on their website or
                social networking site web page, we may collect on your behalf certain tracking and usage data generated
                or provided by users (“End Users”) of the Application (“Usage Data”). This information includes general
                Application usage patterns, Analytical Data with respect to searches conducted through the Application,
                Log Data from users of your website and other information and statistics regarding your website or the
                domain in which the Application is located. You may also request that we receive or gather personally
                identifiable information as part of that Usage Data, including but not limited to email addresses of End
                Users. Other than as necessary to provide you with the Services and subject always to the express consent
                of an End User, we will not review, access, share or disclose Usage Data.</p>
            <h3>Affiliated Sites</h3>
            <p>We offer and provide access to the Service in connection with other websites. Personal information that you
                provide to those sites may be sent to us in order to deliver the Service. We process such information in
                accordance with this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites may have different privacy practices and we
                encourage you to read their privacy policies.</p>
            <h3>Links</h3>
            <p>We may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed.</p>
            <h3>Third Party Sites</h3>
            <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Service. We do not exercise control over the sites that provide
                administration of the Site and the Service (including without limitation bill and credit card payment
                processing, ranking or other information), or over banners, other advertisements or links from within the
                Site or the Service. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect
                data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or
                disclosure of the Personal Information that you submit. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and
                other terms of the other websites before using their services.</p>
