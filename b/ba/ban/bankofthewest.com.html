you provide to us is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</p><p>



Also, if you visit our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only: 

</p><ul>

        <li>Your Internet Service Provider, but not your specific e-mail address. For instance, if 

  your e-mail address is "johndoe@aol.com," only the aol.com part of the address is recognized. 

</li><li>Aggregate information on which pages consumers visit, but no specific information on 

the individual consumer. The aggregate information we collect (for instance, how many "hits" on a particular 

Web page) is used for internal review to improve the content of our Web page, and is then 

destroyed. <p></p></li></ul>



<b>Q. What do you do with information that I volunteer, such as survey information or 

information requests?</b><br>

A. When you request information about a specific product or service, we will use the e-mail 

address, the postal address or the telephone number only to deliver the requested information.<p>



If you enroll in our eTimeBanker service and supply us with personal data (such as e-mail 

address, birth date, income range or home ownership information), we may use this data to 

provide you with personalized information on products, services or special promotions we 

feel will be of interest to you.  However, if you wish to be excluded from receiving such 

information by e-mail, we'll give you an opportunity to tell us this online. We will respect 

your wishes not to receive such e-mail. </p><p>

<b>Q. How can I insure that you will not share information about me in the future?</b><br>

A. If you do not want us to share your nonpublic personal information, if we choose to 

participate in any programs in the future, simply complete the "opt-out" form portion of 

your disclosure, tear it off, place a stamp on it, and place it in the mail.</p><p>



<b>Q. If I've already signed an "opt-out" form, do I have to sign another one?</b><br>

A. No. Your opt-out direction remains in place as long as your account is open.</p><p>



<b>Q. I have opened a new account with Bank of the West since I signed the "opt-out" form.  

Do I need to complete a new form to cover my new product or service?</b><br>

A. We attempt to apply your opt-out direction to all of your accounts at Bank of the West, 

to all joint account holders on those accounts, and to any new accounts you open, whenever 

possible.  However, if the account on which you originally opted out has been closed, or if 

your name or address or other parties on your new account have changed, it may not be 

possible to match your old account and opt-out direction to your new account.  We recommend 

that you complete a new opt-out form.</p><p>



<b>Q. Are there any conditions under which you will share my nonpublic personal 

information?</b><br>

A. There are a few, all of which are allowed under the federal privacy regulation.  They are:<br>

<br>

</p><ol>

      <li> When it is required to complete a service you've requested, such as check printing.  

In these cases, Bank of the West has contracts with vendors that contain clauses that 

meet our stringent standards for protecting our customers' privacy.<br>

</li><li>When we are required to by law or regulation, such as a subpoena or a large cash 

transaction.<br>

</li><li> When any of the signers on the account gives us permission to do so.</li></ol>

<p>

<b>Q. Does this mean you will stop sending me junk mail?</b><br>

A. If you have chosen to opt-out, we will attempt to exclude you and other account holders in 

your household from our internal mailing and phone solicitation lists, whenever possible.  

However, it is not possible to exclude any account holders from receiving "statement stuffers" 

and similar types of materials.  You should also be aware that Bank of the West is required to 

send you certain important types of information, such as change in terms notices, which 

might appear to be "junk mail" but actually isn't.</p><p>



<b>Q. I received several copies of your privacy policy disclosure.  Why?</b><br>

A. If all of your accounts at Bank of the West are "linked" (i.e., all your accounts appear on 

one statement), you should receive only one copy of our privacy policy.  However, if you have 

multiple accounts or receive multiple statements, you may receive a copy of our privacy policy 

in connection with each account.</p><p>

Q. Inside Bank of the West, how do you control information about my accounts?</a></b><a name="3"><br>

A. Bank of the West's employees are informed of their responsibility to protect the 

confidentiality of customer information and are subject to discipline for violating this 

policy.  Only employees actively engaged in the discharge of assigned duties involving customer 

information are authorized to access that information. </a></p><p><a name="3">



<b>Q. Why do you have information about me?</b><br>

A. We collect and use information about individual customers only: <br>

<br>

</a></p><ol><a name="3">

       <li> To open and administer your accounts and provide superior service.<br> 

</li><li> To help us provide you with additional products or services you might want to know 

about.  Many people have told us they like getting information related to their interests 

or alerting them to unique products and services. 

</li><li> To help us protect you and Bank of the West from financial loss. 

</li></a></ol><a name="3">

<p>

In some cases, laws governing financial institutions require us to gather information. For 

example, federal regulations require that we obtain a Social Security number or Tax 

Identification Number for many types of accounts.</p><p> 



<b>Q. What can I do if I discover that information Bank of the West has is inaccurate?</b><br>

A. It's in your interest and ours to have accurate, current and complete information concerning 

you and your accounts. If you believe that we have erroneous information, please contact your 

Bank of the West Branch or call (800) 488-2265 or if in the San Jose Area call (408) 947-5030. 

We want to correct any inaccuracies right away. </p><p>





</p></a><center><a name="3"><b></b></a><b><a name="4">Credit Report Information About You </a></b></center><p><b><a name="4">



Q. Do you use information from consumer credit reports provided from outside the bank?</a></b><a name="4"><br>

A. Yes. It's standard banking industry practice to obtain information from reputable credit 

information reporting agencies. When we do, you are protected both by our own Privacy Policy 

and by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a federal law.</a></p><p><a name="4">



<b>Q. What exactly is on these credit reports?</b>

<br>

A. Your credit report includes personal and financial information such as your account 

balances and your payment history for credit cards, mortgages or other consumer loans.  If 

you don't make payments on time or miss a payment, your credit report may show that, even 

if you catch up on your payments later. Late payments and other "negative" information can 

remain on your credit report for up to 7 years; bankruptcies, for up to 10 years.</a></p><p><a name="4"> 



If you want to see what information is on your credit report, you may call or write the credit 

reporting agencies and request a copy of your report. There is a fee for this service. However, 

if you have been denied credit within the past 60 days because of information in your credit 

report, you are entitled to a free copy of that report. </a></p><p><a name="4">



If you find a problem, promptly inform the credit bureau in writing. The bureau must 

investigate the disputed entry and correct any errors. It's a good idea to let each of the 

major bureaus know if you find a problem in one report.</a></p><p><a name="4">

existence and condition of customers' accounts.</a></p><p><a name="4">



On occasion, an entity other than a credit-reporting agency - such as another financial 

institution or a business - may ask us for credit information about an individual or business 

customer. For example, you may be applying for a loan at another bank or establishing a credit 

relationship with a business. In such instances, we will not provide information about you

<b>Q. What happens if I'm involved in a lawsuit and bank records are subpoenaed?</b><br>

<b>Q. Do you give information about me to anyone else outside Bank of the West's family of 

companies?</b><br>

A. Like most banks, Bank of the West contracts with outside companies to provide support

These vendors are required to treat such customer information confidentially and use the 

information only for the specific bank purpose stated. Vendors are prohibited from reusing 

or selling customer information.</p><p>

to help identify additional products or services that you might want to know about. </p><p>



To collect a customer's unpaid debts, we may also exchange information with financial 

institutions and other companies, in accordance with standard banking industry practice, to 

verify the existence and condition of customers' accounts. </p><p>

other purpose without the customer's consent.</p><p> 



<b>Q. Do you sell my information to telemarketing companies?</b><br>

<b>Q. May I request that you not send product information to me or share information about me 

with companies within the Bank of the West family?</b><br>

A. This law permits us to share within the Bank of the West family of companies and with 

credit reporting agencies information concerning a customer's account history and experiences 

with Bank of the West. However, if you wish to be excluded from:</p><p> 

</p><ol>

      <li> Offers of products or services by mail, and/or<br>

</li><li> Sharing of other information about you within the Bank of the West family of companies; 

</li></ol>

<p>

You should complete and return the opt-out form.

</p><p>

While this may mean you might not receive product information of interest to you, we will 

respect your request not to receive such information by mail. (Of course, we will continue 

to send you routine statements and information concerning your existing accounts.) </p><p>

Q. How can I prevent financial information about me from being used fraudulently?</a></b><a name="6"><br>
