<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p></p><center><b>How Bank of the West Protects Your Privacy</b></center><p></p>

<p>Concern for customer confidentiality and privacy has been a
hallmark of banking for centuries. At Bank of the West, our employees
treat the information we have concerning your accounts in the
same responsible, confidential way we want our own financial affairs
treated.</p>

<p>This privacy policy explains:</p>

<p>a. Bank of theWest's own Privacy Policy to safeguard information
we have about you and your accounts with us.</p>

<p>b. How you can make sure credit reports about you are accurate
and up to date.</p>

<p>c. How to avoid unwanted solicitations.</p>

<p>d. How you can prevent confidential financial information about
you from being used fraudulently by others.</p>

<p>e. How we protect your privacy when you visit this Website.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p></p><center><b>Privacy Policy of Bank of the West</b></center><p></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We recognize the importance you place on your privacy and the
confidentiality of your financial information. We think it's important
for you - as our customer - to be informed of the policies we
have in place to safeguard your privacy:</p>

<p>a. We do all that we can to make sure that information we have
about customers is accurate, and is accessible only by those employees
actively engaged in dealing with you or your accounts.</p>

<p>b. Other than the limited exceptions explained on this website,
it is our practice not to share confidential customer information
outside of Bank of the West. You do not need to request this confidentiality
- it is our standard practice.</p>

<p>c. We educate our employees about their responsibility to protect
your privacy.</p>

<p>Here are answers to common questions you may have:</p>

<p></p><center><b>Our Information About You</b></center><p></p>

<p><b>Q. Inside Bank of the West, how do you control information
about my accounts?</b></p>

<p>A. Our employees are informed of their responsibility to protect
the confidentiality of customer information and are subject to
discipline for violating this policy. Only employees actively
engaged in the discharge of assigned duties involving customer
information are authorized to access that information.</p>

<p><b>Q. Why do you have information about me?</b></p>

<p>A. We collect and use information about individual customers
only:</p>

<p>a. To open and administer your accounts and provide superior
service.</p>

<p>b. To help us provide you with additional products or services
you might want to know about. Many people have told us they like
getting information related to their interests or alerting them
to unique products and services.</p>

<p>c. To help us protect you and us from financial loss.</p>

<p>In some cases, laws governing financial institutions require
us to gather information. For example, federal regulations require
that we obtain a Social Security number or Tax Identification
Number for many types of accounts.</p>

<p>We use information about you only in accordance with the principles
set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><b>Q. What can I do if I discover that information Bank of
the West has is inaccurate?</b></p>

<p>A. It's in your interest and ours for us to have accurate,
current and complete information concerning you and your accounts.
If you believe that we have erroneous information, please let
us know by contacting:</p>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Your Bank of the West branch or by calling <b><u>1-800-488-2265,
    in the 408 area code call, 408-947-5030</u></b>
  </li></ul>
</ul>

<p>We want to correct any inaccuracies right away.</p>

<p></p><center><b>Credit Report Information About You</b></center><p></p>

<p>Q. Do you use information from consumer credit reports provided
from outside the bank?</p>

<p>A. Yes. It's standard banking industry practice to obtain information
from reputable credit information reporting agencies. When we
do so, you are protected both by our own internal Privacy Policy
and by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a federal law.</p>

<p>We will notify you if we decline any application made by you
and if we used a consumer credit report during the processing
of your application.</p>

<p>We may also use credit reports for the purpose of prescreening
prospects for banking products and services. Federal law requires
us to notify you whenever such reports have been used to solicit
your business. You may request that credit reporting agencies
remove your name--- from lists supplied to us for transactions
you do not initiate.</p>

<p><b>Q. Does Bank of the West provide credit information to these
credit-reporting agencies?</b></p>

<p>A. Consistent with the practice of financial institutions and
other businesses, Bank of the West shares certain information
about our customers with reputable credit reporting agencies,
so creditors can verify the existence and condition of customers'
accounts.</p>

<p><b>Q. What exactly is on these credit reports?</b></p>

<p>A. Your credit report includes personal and financial information
such as your payment history for credit cards, mortgages or loans,
and credit card account balances. If you don't make your payments
on time or miss a payment, your credit report will show that,
even if you catch up on your payments later. Late payments and
other "negative" information can remain on your credit
report for up to 7 years; bankruptcies, for up to 10 years.</p>

<p>By law, an individual's credit report can be given to insurance
companies, banks and others when needed to transact business with
you. There are many uses for credit reports. For instance, those
who make loans - such as Bank of the West - may refer to the reports
to verify the credit-worthiness of borrowers.</p>

<p>To examine the status of your credit report:</p>

<p>a. Call or write each of the major credit bureaus and get a
copy of your report.</p>

<p>b. If you spot a problem, promptly inform the credit bureau
in writing.</p>

<p>The bureau must investigate the disputed entry and correct
it if it is erroneous. It's a good idea to let each of the major
bureaus know if you find a problem in one report.</p>

<p>For a fee, each of the three national credit bureaus will supply
you with a copy of your report. However, if you have been denied
credit within the past 60 days because of information in your
credit report, you are entitled to a free copy of that report.</p>

<p>Here is contact information on three of the larger national
credit bureaus:</p>

<p></p><center><b>Use of Information About You Outside Bank of the
West</b></center><p></p>

<p>Q. Do you give information about customers to the government?</p>

<p>A. We only disclose customer information to the government
when we are required to do so by laws and regulations, or when
we are served with a subpoena or court order.</p>

<p><b>Q. What happens if I'm involved in a lawsuit and bank records
are subpoenaed?</b></p>

<p>A. If you are involved in a lawsuit, we will only disclose
information about you or your accounts to third-party litigants
when we are required to do so during a court proceeding.</p>

<p><b>Q. Do you give information about me to anyone else outside
Bank of the West?</b></p>

<p>A. Our policy is not to share specific personal customer information
with independent companies for any purpose not connected with
financial products and services.</p>

<p>Specific customer information may be shared with vendors we
hire to provide operational support, such as computer processing.
In addition, we may share information with companies that participate
with us in supplying high-quality financial products and services
to customers. However, we share information with such companies
only if they agree to treat it confidentially.</p>

<p>We also may share account and customer information among the
legal entities that comprise our family of companies. These entities
within Bank of the West may use the information to help identify
additional products or services that you might want to know about.</p>

<p><b>Q. May I request that you not send product information to
me?</b></p>

<p>A. Yes. If you wish to be excluded from offers of products
or services by mail, please write:</p>

<p>Bank of the West<br>
Marketing Division <br>
1450 Treat Blvd.<br>
Walnut Creek, CA 94596</p>

<p>While this may mean you might not receive product information
of interest to you, we will respect anyone's request not to receive
product information by mail. (Of course, we will continue to send
you routine statements and information concerning your existing
accounts. Also, as described above, we will continue to share
information about our experience with you with credit reporting
agencies, other financial institutions and members of the Bank
of the West family of companies.)</p>

<p></p><center><b>Protecting Yourself From Fraud</b></center><p></p>

<p><b>Q. How can I prevent financial information about me from
being used fraudulently?</b></p>

<p>A. Here are some suggestions:</p>

<p>Never give your credit card or bank account number to any unsolicited
caller who is unknown to you and seeks to sell you something or
offers you a prize.</p>

<p>Check out unfamiliar companies by calling your state consumer
protection office and the local chapter of the Better Business
Bureau. You can also report suspicious telemarketing calls to
the National Fraud Information Center Hotline at (800) 876-7060.
The hotline is run by a nonprofit organization concerned about
telemarketing fraud.</p>

<p>Memorize your personal identification number (PIN) for ATM
transactions and other banking business. Keep it separate from
your card. Never use your Social Security number or PIN number
as a password.</p>

<p>Do not put your address, phone number, or other personal information
that does not appear on the front of your credit card on a credit
card receipt.</p>

<p></p><center><b>Internet Privacy</b></center><p></p>

<p><b>Q. Is my privacy protected if I visit Bank of the West's
Website (www.bankofthewest.com) on the Internet?</b></p>

<p>A. Yes. As a visitor to our Web site, you need not be concerned
about the privacy of your personal information. We do not gather
information on individual users on our Web site. For each visitor
to Bank of the West's Website, our Web server automatically recognizes
only:</p>

<p>a. The consumer's Internet Service Provider (for example, America
Online or att.net), but not your specific e-mail address. For
instance, if your e-mail address is "johndoe@provider.net,
only the provider.net part of the address is recognized.</p>

<p>b. Aggregate information on which pages consumers visit, but
no information on pages visited by any individual consumer. The
aggregate information we collect (for instance, number of "hits"
on a particular Web page) is used for internal review purposes
only, to improve the content of our Web page, and is then discarded.
This information simply enables us to tell which areas of the
site are of most interest to our users and when peak usage times
are.</p>

<p>On this Website <a href="http://www.bankofthewest.com/">www.bankofthewest.com</a>,
we do not collect information concerning your postal mail address
or your telephone number, unless you ask us to, mail information
or contact you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p></p><center><b>Mail Solicitations</b></center><p></p>

<p><b>Q. I get too many mail solicitations from all over the country.
Is there anything I can do about it?</b></p>

<p>A. Although many people appreciate the offers they receive,
some consumers clearly feel that they get too many. While it's
impossible to entirely control who directs mail offers to you,
you can take steps to reduce unwanted offers, safeguard your privacy,
and sit in the information driver's seat.</p>

<p>The information above explains how to contact Bank of the West
to request to be excluded from our mail lists. If you wish to
have your name removed from other mailing lists, send a written
"do not mail" request with your name, address and Social
Security number to:</p>

<p>Mail Preference Service<br>
c/o Direct Marketing Association<br>
P.O. Box 9008<br>
Farmingdale, NY 11735-9008</p>

<p>The Direct Marketing Association will alert its member companies
of your wishes. But bear in mind, the DMA informs only its members.
Non-members won't be aware of your request.
