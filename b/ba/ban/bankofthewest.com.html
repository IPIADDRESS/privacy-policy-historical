</b></p><p><b>Q. Is my privacy protected if I visit Bank of the West's Website 

(www.bankofthewest.com) on the Internet?</b></p>

<p>A. Yes. If you apply online for Bank of the West Bank products, the personal

technology. </p>

<p>Also, if you visit our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes 

only: </p>

<ul>

  <li>Your Internet Service Provider, but not your specific e-mail address. For 

  instance, if your e-mail address is "johndoe@aol.com," only the aol.com part 

  of the address is recognized. 

  </li><li>Aggregate information on which pages consumers visit, but no specific 

  information on the individual consumer. The aggregate information we collect 

  (for instance, how many "hits" on a particular Web page) is used for internal 

  review to improve the content of our Web page and is then destroyed. 

</li></ul><b>

<p>Q. What do you do with information that I volunteer, such as survey 

information or information requests?</p></b>

<p>A. When you request information about a specific product or service, we will 

use the e-mail address, the postal address or the telephone number only to 

deliver the requested information.</p>

<p>If you enroll in our eTime Banker service and supply us with personal data 

(such as e-mail address, birth date, income range or home ownership 

information), we may use this data to provide you with personalized information 

on products, services or special promotions we feel will be of interest to you. 

However, if you wish to be excluded from receiving such information by e-mail, 

we'll give you an opportunity to tell us this online. We will respect your 

wishes not to receive such e-mail.

</p><p align="center"><a name="#12"><b>Summary of the Bank of the West Privacy Policy</b></a><b> 

</b><b>

</b></p><p><b>Q. What are the basic elements of your Privacy Policy?</b></p>

<p>A. We recognize the importance you place on your privacy and the 

confidentiality of your financial information. We want you to be informed of our 

policies to safeguard your privacy: </p>

<dir>

<p>(1) We do all that we can to make sure that information we have about 

customers is accurate and is accessible only by those employees actively engaged 

in dealing with you or your accounts. </p>

<p>(2) Other than the limited exceptions explained in the Privacy Policy, we do 

not share confidential customer information outside the Bank of the West family 

of companies. </p>

<p>(3) We educate our employees about their responsibility to protect your 

privacy. </p></dir>

<p>Click here to view our <a href="http://www.bankofthewest.com/in_pp.htm">Privacy 

Policy</a></p><b>

<p>Q. How can I insure that you will not share information about me in the 

future?</p></b>

<p>A. If you do not want us to share your personal information, if 

we choose to participate 

in any programs in the future, simply contact us as directed in the <a href="#0">Where to Call </a>section of the 

Privacy Policy.<b>

</b></p><p><b>Q. If I’ve already signed an "opt-out" form or opted-out through the 800 

line, do I need to take further action to insure the privacy of my 

information?</b></p>

<p>A. No. Your opt-out direction remains in place as long as your account is 

open.</p><b>

<p>Q. I have opened a new account with Bank of the West since I "opted-out." Do 

I need to opt-out on my new product or service?</p></b>

<p>A. We attempt to apply your opt-out direction to all of your accounts at Bank 

of the West, to all joint account holders on those accounts, and to any new 

accounts you open, whenever possible. However, if the account on which you 

originally opted out has been closed, or if your name or address or other 

parties on your new account have changed, it may not be possible to match your 

old account and opt-out direction to your new account. Contact us as 

directed.</p><b>

<p>Q. Are there any conditions under which you will share my non-public personal 

information?</p></b>

<p>A. There are a few, all of which are allowed under the federal privacy 

regulation. They are:

</p><p>

</p><dir>(1) when it is required to complete a service you’ve requested, such as 

check printing (In these cases, Bank of the West has contracts with vendors that 

contain provisions that 

meet our stringent standards for protecting our customers’ privacy),

<p></p>

<p>(2) when we are required to by law or regulation, such as a subpoena or a 

large cash transaction, and</p>

<p>(3) when any of the signers on the account gives us permission to do 

so.</p></dir><b>

<p>Q. Does this mean you will stop sending me junk mail?</p></b>

<p>A. If you have chosen to opt-out, we will attempt to exclude you and other 

account holders in your household from our internal mailing and phone 

solicitation lists, whenever possible. However, it is not possible to exclude 

any account holders from receiving "statement stuffers" and similar types of 

materials. </p>

<p>You should also be aware that Bank of the West is required to send you 

certain important types of information, such as change in terms notices, which 

might appear to be "junk mail" but actually isn’t.</p><b>

<p>Q. I received several copies of your privacy policy disclosure. Why?</p></b>

<p>A. If all of your accounts at Bank of the West are "linked" (i.e., all your 

accounts appear on one statement), you should receive only one copy of our 

privacy policy. However, if you have multiple accounts or receive multiple 

statements, you may receive a copy of our privacy policy in connection with each 

account.</p>

<p>&nbsp;

</p><p align="center"><a name="#13"><b>Our Information About You</b></a><b>

</b></p><p><b>Q. Inside Bank of the West Bank, how do you control information about my 

accounts?</b></p>

<p>A. Bank of the West's employees are informed of their responsibility to 

protect the confidentiality of customer information and are subject to 

disciplinary action for violating this policy. Only employees actively engaged 

in the discharge of assigned duties involving customer information are 

authorized to access that information. </p><b>

<p>Q. Why do you have information about me?</p></b>

<p>A. We collect and use information about individual customers only: </p>

<dir>

<p>(1) To open and administer your accounts and provide superior service,</p>

<p>(2) To help us provide you with additional products or services you might 

want to know about. Many people have told us they like getting information 

related to their interests or alerting them to unique products and services, 

and</p>

<p>(3) To help us protect you and Bank of the West from financial loss. 

</p></dir>

<p>In some cases, laws governing financial institutions require us to gather 

information. For example, federal regulations require that we obtain a Social 

Security Number or Tax Identification Number for most types of accounts. </p><b>

<p>Q. What can I do if I discover that information Bank of the West has is 

inaccurate?</p></b>

<p>A. It's in your interest and ours to have accurate, current and complete 

information concerning you and your accounts. If you believe that we have 

erroneous information, please contact your Bank of the West Branch or call (800) 

488-2265 or if you are calling from the Santa Clara Valley of California call 

(408) 947-5030. We want to correct any inaccuracies right away. </p>

<p>&nbsp;

</p><p align="center"><a name="#14"><b>Credit Report Information About You</b></a><b> 

</b><b>

</b></p><p><b>Q. Do you use information from consumer credit reports provided from outside 

the bank?</b></p>

<p>A. Yes. It's standard banking industry practice to obtain information from 

reputable credit information reporting agencies. When we do, you are protected 

both by our own Privacy Policy and by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a federal 

law. </p><b>

<p>Q. What exactly is on these credit reports?</p></b>

<p>A. Your credit report includes personal and financial information such as 

your account balances and your payment history for credit cards, mortgages or 

other consumer loans. If you don't make payments on time or miss a payment, your 

credit report may show that, even if you catch up on your payments later. Late 

payments and other "negative" information can remain on your credit report for 

up to 7 years; bankruptcies, for up to 10 years. </p>

<p>If you want to see what information is on your credit report, you may call or 

write the credit reporting agencies and request a copy of your report. There is 

a fee for this service. However, if you have been denied credit within the past 

60 days because of information in your credit report, you are entitled to a free 

copy of that report. </p>

<p>If you find a problem, promptly inform the credit bureau in writing. The 

bureau must investigate the disputed entry and correct any errors. It's a good 

idea to let each of the major bureaus know if you find a problem in one 

report.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Here is how to contact three of the larger national credit bureaus: 

</p><br>Equifax, Inc <br>P.O. Box 740241 <br>Atlanta, GA 30374-0241 <br>(800) 

685-1111 <br>www.equifax.com 

<p><br>Trans Union Corporation <br>P.O. Box 2000 <br>Chester, PA 19022 <br>(800) 

888-4213 <br>www.tuc.com 

</p><p><br>Experian <br>P.O. Box 2002 <br>Allen, TX 75013-2104 <br>(888) 397-3742 

<br>www.experian.com 

</p><p><b>

</b></p><p><b>Q. Does Bank of the West provide credit information to credit reporting 

agencies?</b></p>

<p>A. Yes. In accordance with standard banking industry practice, we share 

certain information about our customers with reputable credit reporting 

agencies, so creditors can verify the existence and condition of customers' 

accounts. </p>

<p>On occasion, an entity other than a credit-reporting agency - such as another 

financial institution or a business - may ask us for credit information about 

an individual or business customer. For example, you may be applying for a loan 

at another bank or establishing a credit relationship with a business. In such 

instances, we will not provide information about you unless you have given your 

prior written authorization. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><a name="#15"><b>Use of Information About You Outside Bank of the 

West </b></a><b>

</b></p><p><b>Q. Do you give information about customers to the government?</b></p>

<p>A. We only disclose customer information to the government,</p>

<dir>(1) when we are required to do so by laws and regulations,

<p></p>

<p>(2) when we are served with a subpoena or court or administrative order, 

or</p>

<p>(3) when a customer authorizes us to do so. </p></dir><b>

<p>Q. What happens if I'm involved in a lawsuit and bank records are 

subpoenaed?</p></b>

<p>A. If you are involved in a lawsuit, we will only disclose information about 

you or your accounts to third-party litigants when we are required to do so 

during a court proceeding. </p><b>

<p>Q. Do you give information about me to anyone else outside Bank of the West's 

family of companies?</p></b>

<p>A. Like most banks, Bank of the West contracts with outside companies to 

provide support services such as data processing, check printing, insurance 

products and statement mailings. These vendors are required to treat such 

customer information confidentially and use the information only for the 

specific bank purpose stated. Vendors are prohibited from reusing or selling 

customer information. </p>

<p>We also may share certain account and customer information among the legal 

entities that comprise the Bank of the West family of companies. These entities 

may use the information to help identify additional products or services that 

you might want to know about. </p>

<p>To collect a customer's unpaid debts, we may also exchange information with 

financial institutions and other companies, in accordance with standard banking 

industry practice, to verify the existence and condition of customers' accounts. 

</p>

<p>We do not share customer information with independent companies for any other 

purpose without the customer's consent. </p><b>

<p>Q. Do you sell my information to telemarketing companies?</p></b>

<p>A. We do not employ telemarketing companies to sell Bank of the West products 

and services, nor do we sell or give customer information to telemarketing 

companies to use to solicit business from you.</p><b>

<p>Q. May I request that you not send product information to me or share 

information about me with companies within the Bank of the West family?</p></b>

<p>A. The law permits us to share within the Bank of the West family of 

companies and with credit reporting agencies information concerning a customer's 

account history and experiences with Bank of the West. However, if you wish to 

be excluded from: </p>

<dir>

<p>(1) Offers of products or services by mail, and/or</p>

<p>(2) Sharing of other information about you within the Bank of the West family 

of companies, </p></dir>

<p>Contact us at the numbers listed in the <a href="#0">Where to Call</a> section of the 

Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>While this may mean you might not receive product information of interest to 

you, we will respect your request not to receive such information by mail. (Of 

course, we will continue to send you routine statements and information 

concerning your existing accounts.) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><a name="#16"><b>Protect Yourself From Fraud</b></a><b> </b><b>

</b></p><p><b>Q. How can I prevent financial information about me from being used 

fraudulently?</b></p>

<p>A. Here are some suggestions: </p>

<ul>

  <li>Never give your credit card or bank account number to any unsolicited 

  caller who is unknown to you and seeks to sell you something or offers you a 

  prize. 

  </li><li>Memorize your personal identification number (PIN) for ATM transactions 

  and other banking business. If you must write it down, keep it separate from 

  your card. 

  </li><li>Never use your Social Security Number as a password. 

  </li><li>Do not put your address, phone number, or other personal information that 

  does not appear on the front of your credit card on a credit card receipt.</li></ul>
