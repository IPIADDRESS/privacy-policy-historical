	  <p><b>Q. Is my privacy protected if I visit Bank of the West's Website (www.bankofthewest.com) on the Internet?</b><br>

      	A. Yes. If you apply online for Bank of the West Bank products, the personal 

      	information you provide to us is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.

	</p><p>Also, for each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only:

      </p><ul>

		<li>The consumer's Internet Service Provider (for example, America 

        Online), but not your specific e-mail address. For instance, if your 

        e-mail address is <i>"johndoe@hawaii.net,</i> only the <i>hawaii.net</i> 

        part of the address is recognized. 

        </li><li>Aggregate information on which pages consumers visit, but no 

        information on pages visited by any individual consumer. The aggregate 

        information we collect (for instance, how many "hits" on a particular 

        Web page) is used for internal review to improve the content of our Web 

        page, and is then discarded.

      </li></ul>

	<p>Here's what we do with information volunteered by the consumer, such as 

      survey information or information requests:

	</p><p><b>E-Mail Address.</b>

	  If you supply us with your e-mail address online 

      when requesting information about a specific product or service, you will 

      only receive the information that you requested when you provided us your 

      e-mail address.

	</p><p><b>eTime Banker/Personal Information:</b> 

	  If you enroll in our eTime Banker service and supply us with personal data (such as e-mail address, birthdate, income 

      range or home ownership information), we may use this data to provide you with personalized information on products, 

      services or special promotions we feel will be of interest to you. However, if you wish to be excluded from receiving 

      such information by e-mail, we'll give you an opportunity to tell us this online. We will respect your wishes not to receive such e-mail.

	</p><p><b>Postal Mail Address.</b>

	  If you supply us with your postal address on-line, you will only receive the 

	  information for which you provided us your address.

	</p><p><b>Telephone Number.</b>

	  information. We want you to be informed of our policies to safeguard your privacy:

	</p><p>(1) We do all that we can to make sure that information we have about customers is accurate, and is accessible 

	  only by those employees actively engaged in dealing with you or your accounts.

	</p><p>(2) Other than the limited exceptions explained in this privacy policy, we do not share confidential customer information 

	  outside the Bank of the West family of companies. You don't need to request this confidentiality – it's our standard practice.

	</p><p>(3) We don't employ outside telemarketing companies to sell Bank of the West products and services, nor do we sell 

	  or give customer information to outside telemarketing companies to use to solicit business from you.

	</p><p>(4) We educate our employees about their responsibility to protect your privacy.

	</p><p><br></p><br>

	<p></p><center><b>Our Information About You</b></center>

	<p><b>Q. Inside Bank of the West Bank, how do you control information about my accounts?</b><br>

	  A. Bank of the West's employees are informed of their responsibility to protect the confidentiality 

	  of customer information and are subject to discipline for violating this policy. Only employees actively 

	  engaged in the discharge of assigned duties involving customer information are authorized to access that 

	  information.

	</p><p><b>Q. Why do you have information about me?</b><br>

	  A. We collect and use information about individual customers only:

	</p><p>(1) To open and administer your accounts and provide superior service.

	</p><p>(2) To help us provide you with additional products or services you might want to know about. Many people 

      have told us they like getting information related to their interests or alerting them to unique products and services.

	</p><p>(3) To help us protect you and Bank of the West from financial loss.

	</p><p>In some cases, laws governing financial institutions require us to gather information. For example, federal

	</p><p>We use information about you only in accordance with the principles set out in this Privacy Policy.

	</p><p>

	</p><p><b>Q. What can I do if I discover that information Bank of the West has is inaccurate?</b><br>

	  When we do, you are protected both by our own Privacy Policy and by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a federal law.

	</p><p>We will notify you if we decline any application made by you and if we used a consumer credit report during the processing of your application.

	</p><p><b>Q. What exactly is on these credit reports?</b><br>

	  A. Your credit report includes personal and financial information such as your account balances and your payment 

	  history for credit cards, mortgages or other consumer loans. If you don't make payments on time or miss a payment, 

	  your credit report may show that, even if you catch up on your payments later. Late payments and other "negative" 

	  information can remain on your credit report for up to 7 years; bankruptcies, for up to 10 years.

	</p><p>By law, an individual's credit report can be given to insurance companies, banks and others when needed to transact 

	  business with you. There are many uses for credit reports. For instance, those who make loans  -- such as Bank of 

	  the West -- may refer to the reports to verify the credit-worthiness of borrowers.

	</p><p>To examine the status of your credit report:

	</p><ul>

		<li>Call or write each of the major credit bureaus and get a copy of your report.

		</li><li>If you spot a problem, promptly inform the credit bureau in writing.

	</li></ul>

	<p>The bureau must investigate the disputed entry and correct any errors. It's a good idea to let each of the major 

	  bureaus know if you find a problem in one report.

	</p><p>For a fee, each of the three national credit bureaus will supply you with a copy of your report. However, if you 

	  have been denied credit within the past 60 days because of information in your credit report, you are entitled 

	  to a free copy of that report.

	</p><p>Here is how to contact three of the larger national credit bureaus:

	<p><b>Q. Does Bank of the West provide credit information to credit reporting agencies?</b><br>

      A. Yes. In accordance with standard banking industry practice, we share certain information about our customers 

      with reputable credit reporting agencies, so creditors can verify the existence and condition of customers' accounts.

	</p><p>On occasion, an entity other than a credit-reporting agency – such as another financial institution or a business --

	  loan at another bank or establishing a credit relationship with a business. In such instances, we will not provide 

	  information about you unless you have given your prior written authorization.
