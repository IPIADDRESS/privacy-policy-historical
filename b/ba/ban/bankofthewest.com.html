Why?</b></p> <p>If all of your accounts at Bank of the West are "linked" (i.e., all your accounts appear on one statement), you should receive only one copy of our privacy policy. However, if you have multiple accounts or receive multiple statements, you may receive a copy of our privacy policy in connection with each account.</p> <a href="#Top"><img alt="" src="../BOW/assets/vcmStaticContent/BOW%20Internet%20Contents/Development/images/btn_backtotop.gif" border="0"></a> <p align="center"><a id="#13" name="#13"></a><b>Our Information About You</b></p> <p><b>Inside Bank of the West Bank, how do you control information about my accounts?</b></p> <p>Bank of the West's employees are informed of their responsibility to protect the confidentiality of customer information and are subject to disciplinary action for violating this policy. Only employees actively engaged in the discharge of assigned duties involving customer information are authorized to access that information.</p> <p><b>Why do you have information about me?</b></p> <p>We collect and use information about individual customers only:</p> <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em"> <p>(1) To open and administer your accounts and provide superior service,</p> <p>(2) To help us provide you with additional products or services you might want to know about (Many people have told us they like getting information related to their interests or alerting them to unique products and services.), and</p> <p>(3) To help us protect you and Bank of the West from financial loss.</p> </div> <p>In some cases, laws governing financial institutions require us to gather information. For example, federal regulations require that we obtain a Social Security Number or Tax Identification Number for most types of accounts.</p> <a href="#Top"><img alt="" src="../BOW/assets/vcmStaticContent/BOW%20Internet%20Contents/Development/images/btn_backtotop.gif" border="0"></a> <p><b>What can I do if I discover that information Bank of the West has is inaccurate?</b></p> <p>It's in your interest and ours to have accurate, current, and complete information concerning you and your accounts. If you believe that we have erroneous information, please contact your Bank of the West Branch or call (800) 488-2265. We want to correct any inaccuracies right away.</p> <a href="#Top"><img alt="" src="../BOW/assets/vcmStaticContent/BOW%20Internet%20Contents/Development/images/btn_backtotop.gif" border="0"></a> <p align="center"><a id="#14" name="#14"></a><b>Credit Report Information About You</b></p> <p><b>Do you use information from consumer credit reports provided from outside the bank?</b></p> <p>Yes. It's standard banking industry practice to obtain information from reputable credit information reporting agencies. When we do, you are protected both by our own Privacy Policy and by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a federal law.</p> <a href="#Top"><img alt="" src="../BOW/assets/vcmStaticContent/BOW%20Internet%20Contents/Development/images/btn_backtotop.gif" border="0"></a> <p><b>What exactly is on these credit reports?</b></p> <p>Your credit report includes personal and financial information such as your account balances and your payment history for credit cards, mortgages or other consumer loans. If you don't make payments on time or miss a payment, your credit report may show that, even if you catch up on your payments later. Late payments and other "negative" information can remain on your credit report for up to 7 years; bankruptcies, for up to 10 years.</p> <p>If you want to see what information is on your credit report, you may call or write the credit reporting agencies and request a copy of your report. There is a fee for this service. However, if you have been denied credit within the past 60 days because of information in your credit report, you are entitled to a free copy of that report.</p> <p>If you find a problem, promptly inform the credit bureau in writing. The bureau must investigate the disputed entry and correct any errors. It's a good idea to let each of the major bureaus know if you find a problem in one report.</p> <p>Here is how to contact three of the larger national credit bureaus:</p> <p>Equifax, Inc<br> P.O.
