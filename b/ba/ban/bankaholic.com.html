<p><u>Log Files, Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers</u><br>
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality, and to document your consent to receiving products, services or communications from us or our partners. If we link such information with personally identifiable information in a manner that identifies a particular individual, then we will treat all such information as personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Bankrate, LLC and our partners, affiliates, advertisers, analytics teams, or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking usersâ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. We use cookies to help us know that you are logged on, provide you with features based on your preferences, understand when you are interacting with our Services, and compile other information regarding use of our Services. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use cookies to collect and store information. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.</p>
<p>We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs), such as Flash cookies and HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

<p><u>Network Advertising</u><br>
From time to time, we may participate in, partner with, or use advertising networks, such as third-party advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and research firms. For example, we use Google AdSense to publish ads on our Services.  When you view or click on an ad, a cookie will be set to help better provide advertisements that may be of interest to you on this and other Web sites. In addition, we may use third-party advertising networks to serve advertisements to you on our Web site, or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. This practice is often referred to as âonline behavioral advertising.â Please see the âOnline Behavioral Advertisingâ subsection of <a style="color: #75BF00;" href="http://www.bankrate.com/coinfo/privacy.asp#behavior">Choices About How We Use and Collect Your Information</a> below to read about how you can prevent certain third-party advertising networks from collecting information about you.</p>
<p><strong>How we Secure Your Information</strong><br>
Bankrateâs web servers support the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) transaction protocol originally developed by Netscape and now largely accepted as an industry standard. The purpose of this encryption protocol is to keep confidential the information passed back and forth between a web server and its users. In addition, Bankrate uses 128-Bit Domestic Grade Strong Encryption, the most powerful encryption commercially available for Internet products (however, be aware that if you are using a 40-bit browser, your encryption level, while secure, is not the highest level available). We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the siteâs servers from unauthorized access using industry standard computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully developed security procedures and practices. In addition, a username, member ID name and password are required for you to use, view or change application or interview information. We use both internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Information</strong><br>
We may make Use of Your Information for various lawful business purposes. Among others, these purposes may include using Your Information to:</p>
<ul class="priv-term">

<p><u>Engage in customer support</u>. For example, we might confirm and complete transactions requested by you, verify information you provide to us and provide you with administrative notices.</p>
</li>

<p><u>Contact you and provide you with information</u>. For example, we might provide or contact you through telephone, email, postal or other communications with Service updates, promotional materials, surveys, offers, quotes, personalized information and other information from us or our business partners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Analyze, improve and manage our Services and operations</u>. For example, we might obtain feedback regarding our Services, understand and anticipate your needs and preferences, better understand your use of our Services, customize and tailor Service content and advertising, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, engage in statistical analysis and provide feedback to our vendors, advertisers and other third parties.</p>
</li>

<p>In connection with a Business Transfer, as defined below (see <a style="color: #75BF00;" href="http://www.bankrate.com/coinfo/privacy.asp#transfers">Business Transfers</a> below); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To our affiliated companies (i.e., companies under common control or management with us).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you do not want Your Information shared as described above, then you should not provide us with Your Information. </strong></p>
<p><u>Requests for Quotes and Services from Requested Service Providers </u><br>
As noted above, we may share Your Information with Requested Service Providers when you use our Services to request a quote, services or information from one or more third parties (a âRequestâ).<strong> IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, REQUESTED SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY WITH QUOTES VIA MAIL, TELEPHONE, TEXT MESSAGE, FAX, EMAIL AND OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION. YOU MAY RECEIVE TELEMARKETING CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING A REQUEST THROUGH OUR SERVICES, EVEN IF YOU ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY OR ANY OTHER DO NOT CALL REGISTRY.</strong></p>
<p>If you are matched with Requested Service Providers, you expressly consent to the Requested Service Providers conducting any research necessary to provide you with a response to your Request. Requested Service Providers may need to share Your Information to conduct such research. <strong>If you do not want Requested Service Providers to conduct necessary research to provide you with a response to your Request, then you should not submit a Request.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please note that if you submit a Request through our Services and we share Your Information as described above in connection with your Request, you will not have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of Your Information in connection with that Request.</strong></p>
<p><u>Aggregation and De-Personalization</u><br>
We may take Your Information and de-identify it either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating Your Information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-identifying Your Information). We reserve the right to share, loan, rent, sell, or otherwise disclose such information to third parties at any time, for any lawful purpose, without notice or compensation to you.</p>
<p><u>Sharing with Friends</u><br>
If the Services contains any functionality allowing you to send content to a friend, then please be aware that: (a) we may display your email address to your friend; and (b) we may use information you provide about your friend to facilitate the communication and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We do not store your friends email address in our database. Your friend will receive a one-time message notifying them of the shared content.</p>
<p><u>Sweepstakes</u><br>
If you are submitting information to us pursuant to a sweepstakes entry, we reserve the right to share, loan, rent, sell or otherwise disclose the information that you submit with third parties at any time, for any lawful purpose without notice or compensation to you. Participation in these sweepstakes is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose Your Information. Please refer to the official rules and privacy policy for each individual sweepstakes for our specific policies regarding information sharing and disclosure pursuant to that sweepstakes entry.</p>
<p><u>Circumvention of Security Measures</u><br>
No method of transmission or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. Additionally, by way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose Your Information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary within this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use or any other applicable agreement or policy, you use our Services at your own risk and we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that Your Information will always remain private. In the event that an unauthorized third party compromises our security measures, we will not be responsible for any damages directly or indirectly caused by an unauthorized third partyâs ability to view, use or disseminate Your information.</p>
<p><u>Business Transfers</u><br>
We specifically and expressly reserve the right to disclose, lease, sell, assign or transfer Your Information collected through our Services, and any of our databases, together with any personally identifiable information contained in such databases, to third parties in connection with a Business Transfer. A âBusiness Transferâ means a share or asset sale, acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, spin-off, bankruptcy or other corporate change involving us and/or our affiliates, even if the Business Transfer is only being contemplated and regardless of whether the Business Transfer relates to a part or a whole of our business. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our business, equity, and/or assets (including our Services) to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any lawful purpose, without compensation to you.
