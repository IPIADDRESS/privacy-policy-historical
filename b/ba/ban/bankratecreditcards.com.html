We may use these third-party advertising networks for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to you. Advertising networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences about a consumer's interests and preferences, which enables their computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumer's specific interests. This practice is often referred to as "online behavioral advertising." For example, a third-party advertising network might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the type of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or not you visit specific pages of a website, the location of your Internet service provider's presence, the date and time of a visit to a website and other interactions between you and a website.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

You can prevent DAA member companies from collecting preference data about you by clicking <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">here</a>&nbsp;and following the DAA's directions. Note that if you opt out through the DAA, you will still receive advertising. In addition, if you opt out through the DAA and later delete your cookies, use a different browser or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt out choice.</li></ul><h3>Information You Disclose to Third Parties&nbsp;</h3><p>You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from third parties in connection with our Services.

For example, if you click to apply for a product such as a credit card through our Services, you may be linked to a third-party website to complete an application.
