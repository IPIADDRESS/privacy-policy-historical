        <h1>
        Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Bank of Western Australia (ABN 22 050 494 454) ("BankWest") Australian Financial Services Licence
        Number 236872 and may also apply to a related body corporate of BankWest but only if we say that this Privacy Policy applies to that related
        body corporate ("Relevant Related Company").</p>

        <p>The terms "we", "us" or "our" means BankWest or a Relevant Related Company (where applicable).</p>

        <p>The term "related body corporate" has the same meaning as given in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</p>

        <p>We are bound by the National Privacy Principles ("Principles") of the Privacy Act, 1988 (Cth) and are committed to protecting personal
        information we may hold at any time in respect of any individual, in accordance with the requirements of those Principles. "Personal
        information" for the purposes of this Privacy Policy is information about and which identifies individuals. It includes information obtained
        from an individual or a third party and, for individual credit applicants and guarantors, includes anything about credit worthiness,
        standing, history and capacity which, under and in accordance with the Privacy Act may lawfully be exchanged. In general, we&nbsp; will not
        use or disclose personal information collected about you otherwise than for a purpose set out in this&nbsp;Privacy Policy, for a purpose you
        would reasonably expect, a purpose required or permitted by law, or a purpose otherwise disclosed to, or authorised by, you.</p>

        <p>We may, in connection with particular services we offer or provide to you, make other privacy disclosures to you or seek your authority to
        use your personal information in ways which are different from or more specific than those stated in this Privacy Policy. In the event of any
        inconsistency between the provisions of this Privacy Policy and those other disclosures, the other disclosures will prevail.</p>

        <h3>Personal Information Collected before 21 December 2001</h3>The National Privacy Principles came into force on 21 December 2001 but some
        of the Principles have application to personal information collected prior to as well as after that date. This means that for personal
        information we hold, which was collected prior to 21 December 2001, we will, in accordance with those particular Principles:<br>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <div>
              take reasonable steps to ensure that such information, if used, is accurate, complete and up-to-date;
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>
            <div>
              take reasonable steps to protect it from misuse, loss or unauthorised access, use or disclosure;
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>
            <div>
              provide you with access to the information if we still use it;
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>
            <div>
              not use any government identifier to identify you; and
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>
            <div>
              only transfer such information overseas with your consent or as authorised by the Principles.
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Except in so far as this Privacy Policy further addresses the particular Principles reflected in those five matters, the remainder of this
        document is concerned with personal information which is collected on or after 21 December 2001.</p>

        <h3>Collection of Personal Information</h3>We will not ordinarily collect any information about you except where you provide it to us or it
        is provided to us with your authority.<br>

        <p>The types of personal information we collect generally includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, tax file number, date
        of birth, employment and income details and other financial details including credit history.</p>

        <p>In certain circumstances, we may also collect personal information about you which is sensitive. Sensitive information includes
        information about your health, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of professional or trade associations or a criminal record.
        Unless the collection of sensitive information is required or permitted by or under law, we will obtain your consent to its collection. If
        the sensitive information relates directly to your ability to meet a financial obligation to us, you consent to our collection of it.<br>
        We will collect personal information directly from you when you open an account with us, complete an application form for one of our products
        or services, deal with us over the telephone or in person, send us a letter or visit our website. We may, for purposes of security, training,
        or information or transaction verification, listen to and/or record telephone calls to which you are a party with us.</p>

        <p>On occasions, we may need to collect personal information about you from third parties, such as credit reporting agencies, our business
        alliance partners, your agents or third party brokers. If your consent to this collection is required by law, we will first obtain your
        consent prior to collecting the information.</p>

        <p>We only collect personal information about you that is necessary for our functions and activities and, ordinarily, you will be told the
        purposes for which we collect that information when it is collected.</p>

        <p>As a general rule the collection of your personal information will be necessary for us to provide a product or service to you or to
        maintain our relationship with you.</p>

        <p>Additionally, the purposes for which we will generally collect and use your personal information will include:</p>
