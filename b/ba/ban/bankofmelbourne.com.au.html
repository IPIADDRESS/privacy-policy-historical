	<div class="legalline"></div>
<a name="privacy2"></a><h4>This policy and other privacy statements</h4>
<p>This privacy policy explains how we collect personal information and how we maintain, use and disclose that information. It also provides some detail about your privacy rights along with our general rights and obligations and our policy in relation to the personal information we keep on record.</p>
<p>When you apply for a new product or service, the application form includes notices about privacy and requests for consent. Those privacy notices (called privacy statements) specify in more detail how any information about you may be used and disclosed in relation to the particular product or service.</p>
<p>When you apply for or use one of our products or services, you consent to us collecting, maintaining, using and disclosing personal information about you and provided by you or by another person in accordance with the privacy statement in the application form and this policy.</p>

<p>This privacy policy does not apply to parties that may be linked or associated with our website. Those website owners are responsible for the privacy of the information they collect and should be contacted directly for details of their privacy policies.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<div class="legalline"></div>

<a name="privacy3"></a><h4> What information does Bank of Melbourne hold?</h4>
<p>The types of information we keep on record will depend on the type of product or service requested by you.
Generally, we keep a record of one or more of the following types of information about you:</p>
<ul class="privacy">
<li>	information that identifies you, such as your name and address and other information provided by you and people nominated by you; </li>
<li>	if you apply for a loan or credit card or guarantee another person's loan, credit information about you and property reports about any property which secures your obligations to us; </li>
<li>if you apply for insurance, information about what is being insured (including health information about you, your income and occupation if you are requesting life, health or accident insurance), information about your beneficiaries and information about property owned by you if you are requesting some type of property insurance; </li>
<li>account transaction information including credits and debits or claims information for insurance products. </li>
</ul>

<p>All information sought is required for our business purposes, which are detailed generally in this privacy policy and more specifically in our application forms or on web pages which allow you to contact us.
We do not actively seek to collect sensitive information (for example health information or information about your racial or ethnic origin or any criminal record), unless it is necessary for our business purposes. If we do have to collect sensitive information, we will do so in accordance with the National Privacy Principles.</p>
<p>Sometimes we act as an agent for others when collecting information about you, such as for our preferred insurance companies. We will tell you when we do this.</p>
<p>During the course of our relationship with you, we may gather information about you relating to all products and services that we or other members of the Westpac Group or our preferred suppliers provide to you. This information is used to help us form views about how we can improve our relationship with you.</p>

<p class="top"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
	<div class="legalline"></div>
 
<a name="privacy4"></a><h4>How Bank of Melbourne collects information from its website</h4>
<p>We collect and hold information about you when you:</p>
<ul class="privacy">
<li>	complete an online application or other type of form; </li>
<li>provide us with your email address; or </li>
<li>access and use our services through our website.</li>
</ul> 

<p>When you use our "Send to Friend" email service or post a link to our website on Facebook or Twitter, we will not collect or hold any information you enter. </p>
<p>
We also collect some statistical information about visitors to our website (for example, the number of visitors, pages viewed, types of transactions conducted, time online and documents downloaded). Some of this statistical information is collected by using cookies, but none of the data we collect allows us to identify a visitor. We use this information to evaluate our website performance and continually improve our services.</p>
<p>Other than statistical information, we do not collect any information about you through our website unless you provide the information to us.</p>

<p class="top"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
	<div class="legalline"></div>


<a name="privacy5"></a><h4> How Bank of Melbourne generally collects your information</h4>
<p>Generally, we only collect personal information about you from you, unless it is not reasonable or practical for us to do so or you consent. For example, you may authorise us to collect information from a third party, like your employer, to confirm your income details, or we may engage an agent, such as a mortgage broker, to collect information on our behalf, or you may be named as a referee or beneficiary in another application for one of our products or services. We may also collect information about you from other members of the Westpac Group or from publicly available sources such as company registers or land title registries.</p>

<p class="top"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
	<div class="legalline"></div>

<a name="privacy6"></a><h4> How may Bank of Melbourne use your personal information?</h4>
<p>
We use your personal information to:</p>
<ul class="privacy">
<li>respond to your request or help us process your application for our products or services (including performing any identity check required by the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006, and a needs analysis, where necessary); </li>
<li>effectively manage and administer all products and services we provide to you including banking, treasury, financial planning and insurance products and services (for example we may use your email address to communicate with you about the services we provide to you); </li>
<li>assess, process and investigate claims made under any insurance products we provide to you; and </li>
<li>ensure our internal business operations are running smoothly which may include fulfilling legal requirements and conducting confidential systems maintenance and testing.</li>
</ul> 
<p>When we request your information we may give more specific details about the way we use your information.</p>

<p class="top"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
	<div class="legalline"></div>


<a name="privacy7"></a><h4> What rights does Bank of Melbourne have to disclose personal information?</h4>
<p>Usually we must get your consent before we tell anyone about you, your accounts or your credit information. You can give us your consent expressly or it may be implied by your conduct.</p>
<p>Sometimes the law requires us to give out information about you. For example, we must tell the Australian Tax Office how much interest we pay you.</p>
<p> Another example is giving your account details to a court if we are ordered to do so under a subpoena.</p>
<p>Depending on the product or service that we provide to you, if it is necessary we may also disclose your personal information to:
</p><ul class="privacy">
<li>our external service providers (which may be located overseas) for the purposes of our business, for example organisations that provide card authorisation, clearing and settlement services (such as Visa or MasterCard), our lenders' mortgage insurer, claims investigators, mailing houses, property valuers, surveyors, auctioneers and real estate agents. Information is only disclosed on a confidential basis; </li>
<li>other persons who have an interest in any property offered to Bank of Melbourne as security; </li>
<li>any party acquiring an interest in any business or your credit or loan account and any related securities provided by you or any other person; </li>
<li>government agencies in connection with your loan, such as for stamping and registration of mortgages;</li> 
<li>any organisation which you request us to or any persons acting on your behalf, including your financial adviser, broker, solicitor, or accountant - unless you tell us not to, referees, any person with whom you transact (for example merchants, to process your transactions) or any financial institution nominated by you (for example in a direct debit); and </li>
<li>any referees, any person with whom you transact (for example merchants, to process your transactions) or any financial institution nominated by you (for example in direct debit). </li>
</ul>
<p>We will not disclose your health information or information about your medical history unless you tell us to.</p>
<p>We may at other times give you more details about our disclosure practices in relation to specific products or services - for example on the forms we use to collect personal information about you.</p>

<p class="top"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
	<div class="legalline"></div>


<a name="privacy8"></a><h4>How may Bank of Melbourne and the Westpac Group use your personal information?</h4>
<p>Your personal information may also be used by Bank of Melbourne or other members of the Westpac Group to help assess your total relationship and product holding within the Westpac Group, analyse products and services, evaluate the needs of our customers and develop new products.</p>
<p>We may also provide access to your personal information to members of the Westpac Group to inform you of products and services offered by any member of the Westpac Group or preferred organisations which we think may be of interest or value to you. If you tell us or have previously told us that you do not wish to receive such information, then it will not be sent to you. Your health information or information about your medical history will not be disclosed to other members of the Westpac Group for this purpose.</p>


<p class="top"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
	<div class="legalline"></div>


<a name="privacy9"></a><h4>How Bank of Melbourne protects the security of your information</h4>
<p>
We take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.</p>
<p>
We provide the maximum level of security when you use our online products and services. Please <a href="http://www.stgeorge.com.au/online-services/security-centre/we-protect-you/our-security-measures" target="_blank">view more information</a> about our security.</p>
<p>
We have physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information which is held by us. For example, your personal information is stored in secured office premises, in electronic databases requiring logins and passwords for access and/or at one of our secured warehouses. Access to information stored electronically is restricted to staff whose job purpose requires access. We require all staff to maintain the confidentiality of customer information.</p>
<p>
Any visitor, for any purpose, to any part of our premises in which customer personal information is kept is required to register with a security desk or be accompanied by a member of staff while in the premises.</p>
<p>We use secure methods to destroy or de-identify any personal information as soon as the law permits, provided the information is no longer needed by us for any purpose. Ordinarily, for information about a particular account, we destroy the information seven years from the date you close the account.</p>

<p class="top"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
	<div class="legalline"></div>
 
 
<a name="privacy10"></a><h4> Changes to our Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>We may amend this policy from time to time. Not all changes to our privacy policy will require your consent, for example where office security procedures are changed. We will notify you of any change to our information handling policy that requires your consent before being implemented.</p>

<p class="top"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
	<div class="legalline"></div>
 
 <a name="privacy11"></a><h4>What are your rights?</h4>
<p>You need not give us any of the personal information about you or any other person which may be requested in our communications with you. However, without that information, we may not be able to process an application, fulfil your request or provide you with an appropriate level of service.</p>

   <h2>Social Media: Dos and Don'ts</h2>
   <p>
At Bank of Melbourne, we love to have a yarn. This means interacting with you and generating conversation through various online channels. So these channels remain as effective and worthwhile as possible, we have a core set of principles, which we ask everyone to adhere to.</p>
   <h4>Do: speak your voice</h4>
<p>Social media succeeds when information is shared between users. While we have online moderators for all social channels, we cannot always verify all information. Therefore, the views, comments or policies expressed by users are theirs which we may elect to share but which do not reflect those of Bank of Melbourne or any member of the Westpac Group.</p>
<h4>Don’t: share your personal information</h4>
<p>Some things are better left unsaid. We will never ask you to supply personal information over Facebook, Twitter, or any other social media platform we engage in. Keep in mind that these forums are public and as such, you should only share information you wish the general public to see.</p>
<h4>Do: keep it friendly, keep it fair</h4>
<p>We welcome expressions of opinion, but it’s important your contributions add value to the community and promote positivity. So don’t post anything that may be seen as obscene, offensive, derogatory or malicious. The purpose of these online communities is to share and inspire, and not to discourage. Be open-minded and remember that not everyone will necessarily agree with you.</p>
<h4>Do: keep it relevant</h4>
<p>Think about what you’re saying and where you’re saying it, and ask yourself if it’s relevant. Users are not permitted to post commercial messaging of any kind. This includes spam and marketing messaging, as well as content protected by copyright or trademark. </p>

<h4>Don’t: spread viruses</h4>

<p>Our online communities are built on safety and trust. So don’t post links to third-party sites that may contain viruses or malicious software that could break that trust. Doing so may result in you being blocked from contributing. Do not post anything that violates the laws of your country, state, territory, province or city.
</p>

<h4>Don’t: mind if we share</h4>

<p>Every now and then, something comes along too good to keep quiet. When this happens, Bank of Melbourne and Westpac may reproduce your comments to promote Bank of Melbourne or for training and other business purposes. Commenting on the site means that you understand this and give permission for your content to be used, distributed, changed and displayed in any way and in any medium  as we see fit.
</p>
<p>If any comments you make go against these guidelines, we reserve the right to delete them. We also reserve the right to block any user at any time, with or without notice, and for any reason, if we feel they are not adhering to the guidelines.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns, or want to report any misuse, please email our online moderators directly at <a href="mailto:help@bankofmelbourne.com.au">help@bankofmelbourne.com.au</a>.</p>

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ENTRY INTO THE BANK OF MELBOURNE TERM DEPOSIT PROMOTION <br>

("THE PROMOTION")</p>

<p>1.	Information on how to enter and prize details form part of these terms and conditions; however, to the extent that there is any inconsistency between these terms and conditions and any other published material, these terms and conditions will prevail. By participating in this Promotion, each participant fully and unconditionally agrees and acknowledges that these terms and conditions are binding.</p>
<p>2.	The Promoter is Bank of Melbourne – a Division of Westpac Banking Corporation ABN 33 007 457 141 of 275 Kent Street, Sydney, NSW (“Bank of Melbourne” or “the Promoter”), tel: 13 22 66. The Promoter and its related bodies corporate (as that term is defined in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)) will be known as “the Westpac Group”.</p>
<p>3.	The Promotion commences at 12.01am Eastern Daylight Savings Time (“EDST”) on 2 March 2011 and closes at 11.59pm Eastern Standard Time (“EST”) on 31 July 2011 (“the Promotion Period”).</p>  
<p>4.	Entry is open to all residents of Victoria who are over the age of 16 years and who submit a valid entry in accordance with clause 5 during the Promotion Period (“an Eligible Entrant”). Employees and contractors of the Westpac Group and their immediate families are ineligible to enter. </p>  
<p>5.	To enter this Promotion, an Eligible Entrant must, during the Promotion Period: 
</p><ul class="privacy">
<li>(a)	access the Promotion page at <a href="http://www.bankofmelbourne.com.au" target="_blank">www.bankofmelbourne.com.au</a>;</li>
<li>(b)	complete all required fields on the entry form including full name, email address, post code and mobile number; </li>
<li>(c)	confirm your status as a Victorian resident; and</li>
<li>(d)	opt in to receive email updates about Bank of Melbourne’s news, products and services;</li>
</ul>
 (“Entry”). No responsibility will be accepted by the Promoter for lost, late, incomplete, illegible, or misdirected Entries.<p></p>  
<p>6.	Multiple Entries are not permitted. Entrants will only receive one entry into the draw for the first valid Entry submitted during the Promotion Period. All subsequent entries will be discarded. </p>  
<p>7.	There are 2 prizes available.   Each Prize consists of a Bank of Melbourne 6 month Term Deposit account containing $2,500 valued at $2,500 at time of publication.    Account opening requirements apply.   Failure to meet the Bank of Melbourne’s account opening requirements will result in the Prize being forfeited.  Information on Bank of Melbourne term deposits accounts can be accessed at <a href="http://www.bankofmelbourne.com.au" target="_blank">www.bankofmelbourne.com.au</a>.   The total retail value of all Prizes offered under this Promotion is $5,000 at time of publication. The Promoter takes no responsibility for any variation in the Prize value. Prizes are not transferable, exchangeable or redeemable for cash.</p>  
<p>8.	The prize draw will be conducted on 15 August 2011 at Level 8, 530 Collins Street, Melbourne at 10am EST (the “Draw”).  The winner will be determined by way of a random selection from a computer database containing all Entries from Eligible Entrants.  The Entrants that submitted the first two Entries drawn will each receive a Prize (“the Winners”). The allocation of the Prizes to the Winners is final and the Promoter will not enter into any correspondence in relation to the Prize or the Promotion.</p>  
<p>9.	Winners will be notified by phone and mail to the address disclosed on the Entry on 16 August 2011. In the event the winner can not be contacted on this day, the Promoter will continue to attempt to contact the Winner up until the prize claim deadline outlined in these terms and conditions. The Winners’ names will also be published in the Public Notices section of The Age Newspaper on 24 August 2011.   To claim their Prize, the Winners must respond to the notification in the manner that will be set out in the notification letter.  Entrants are responsible for keeping the Promoter informed of any changes to their contact information during and immediately following the Promotion Period.</p>  
<p>10.	To claim their Prize a Winner must attend a Bank of Melbourne branch to open the term deposit account.   The standard published interest rate applicable to these term deposits at the date of opening the account will apply.  Interest payment frequency will be at the discretion of the Bank of Melbourne.   Term Deposit account opening requirements apply and failure to meet these requirements will result in the Prize being forfeited.  </p>  
<p>11.	The Winners may be liable to declare the Prize for taxation purposes and will be liable for any tax payable in respect of a Prize. Entrants should seek independent financial advice in relation to any tax payable on the Prize and the potential impact on their personal financial situation prior to entering the Promotion.</p>  
<p>12.	If any Prize is not claimed by 16 November 2011, the Promoter may conduct such further draws at the same place as the original draw as may be necessary to apportion all such unclaimed prizes. The Promoter will comply with any applicable legislation regarding any unclaimed prizes and any written directions of any competent authority in that regard. If permitted by the applicable legislation, the Promoter will conduct a redraw at 11am EDST on 17 November 2011. Each winner will be notified by telephone on or around 18 November 2011.  The winners name(s) will also be published in the Public Notices section of The Age Newspaper on 25 November 2011. </p>  
<p>13.	Except for guarantees, warranties and conditions implied by law which cannot be excluded, neither the Promoter nor any other member of the Westpac Group make any guarantees, representations or warranties, express or implied, regarding the quality or suitability of any prizes awarded under these terms and conditions.</p>  
<p>14.	Nothing in these terms and conditions is intended to exclude, restrict or modify any right or remedy, or any guarantee, warranty or other term or condition, implied or imposed by any legislation which cannot lawfully be excluded or limited.  This may include the Corporations Act 2001, the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, Australian Consumer Law or any equivalent State or Territory legislation. If any guarantee, warranty, term or conditions implied or imposed under the Australian Consumer Law or any other applicable legislation in relation to any prizes awarded under these terms and conditions cannot be excluded (a “Non-Excludable Provision”) and the Promoter is able to limit the remedy for a breach of the Non-Excludable Provision, then the liability of the Promoter and all members of the Westpac Group for breach of the Non-Excludable Provision is limited to one or more of the following at the Promoter's option:
</p><ul class="privacy">
<li>(i)	the replacement of the prize or the supply of an equivalent prize, </li>
<li>(ii)	the repair of the prize, </li>
<li>(iii)	the supplying of the prize again,</li>
<li>(iv)	the payment of the cost of replacing the prize or of acquiring an equivalent prize, </li>
<li>(v)	the payment of the cost of having the prize repaired; or</li>
<li>(vi)	the payment of the costs of having the prize supplied again.</li>
</ul> <p></p>  
<p>15.	To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Promoter and all other members of the Westpac Group expressly disclaim liability for any loss or damage whatsoever (including but not limited to indirect or consequential loss) or for any personal injury which is suffered or sustained in connection with any participant’s participation in this Promotion or the acceptance of any Prize. The Winner indemnifies the Promoter and all members of the Westpac Group against any liability, injury, loss or damage which may be suffered, incurred or sustained by the Promoter or any member of the Westpac Group arising out of, relating to, or in any way connected with, any act or omission (including negligence) by the Winner, or its use of the Prize, or its breach of these terms and conditions.  </p>  
<p>16.	The Promoter collects personal information from all participants in order to conduct the Promotion. If the information requested is not provided, the participant may not participate in the Promotion or claim a Prize and their entry may be discarded. It is a condition of entry into the Promotion that the Winner consents to the publication of their name and city of origin in any advertisements or articles relating to the Promotion or the Prize and participates in any media releases which may include photographs of the Winner by the Promoter or any other member of the Westpac Group. By entering this promotion, participants consent to the use of their names and likenesses in this manner. Personally-identifying information collected from participants in this Promotion is subject to the Promoter’s privacy policies, which can be found at <a href="http://www.bankofmelbourne.com.au" target="_blank">www.bankofmelbourne.com.au</a>  and will be handled in accordance with all applicable laws in Australia. </p>  
<p>17.	Neither the Promoter nor any other member of the Westpac Group will be responsible for any problems or technical malfunction of any computer online systems, servers or providers, computer equipment, software, failure of any email or entry to be received by the Promoter on account of technical problems or traffic congestion on the Internet.</p>  
<p>18.	If this Promotion is not capable of running as planned for any reason  (including but not limited to failure or malfunction of any computer equipment by reason of infection by computer virus, power failure, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention, fraud, or technical failures or any other causes which corrupt or affect the administration security, fairness, integrity or proper conduct of this Promotion), the Promoter reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual who undermines the integrity or fair running of the Promotion for other entrants, including by tampering with the entry process, and, after consulting with the relevant legislative authorities, to cancel, terminate, modify or suspend the Promotion.</p>
