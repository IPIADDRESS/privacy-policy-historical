	<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
	<p>Here at RootMusic, Inc. (“RootMusic”), we understand and respect your concerns about the use of your personal information. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our practices and policies regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information on this website and on our online service on the Facebook platform (collectively, our “Service”). “Personal information,” as used in this policy, is information that allows a person to directly identify an individual, such as name or email address, and information that is combined directly with such identifying information.</p>
	<p>We will collect information about you when you register to post messages on one of our discussion forums, when you register to use BandPage or BandPage Plus, when you transmit information to us via our Service (including, without limitation, by email), when you participate in one of our promotions, and when you otherwise use our Service. By doing any of the foregoing, you assent to this privacy policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this policy, please do not engage in any of these activities.</p>
	<h3>INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION</h3>
	<p>The following describes the types of personal and other information we may collect about you on our Service, and how we use and maintain that information:</p>
	<h4>Registration Information Collected through Facebook</h4>
	<p>In general, you may visit our website without revealing any personal information other than technology-related information described in the “Website Information” section below. However, certain sections and features of our Service are only available to registered users, who must log in to our Service using unique access credentials. Currently, we only permit a user of our Service to log in using his or her Facebook credentials.</p>
	<p>By logging in to our Service using your Facebook credentials, you permit the Service to connect to Facebook and to access and use certain information related to your Facebook account. If you register for our Service as the administrator of an artist or band, we request your name, Facebook ID, location (typically, a city you have specified), email address, pages that you manage on Facebook, and any other public portions of your Facebook profile. If you register for our Service as a user, we will access and your name, Facebook ID, picture, list of friends, and other public portions of your Facebook profile. Additionally, if you request to sign up for a band or artist’s mailing list while logged in to the Service, we will request your email address and your location (typically, a city you have specified) from Facebook.</p>
	<p>If you allow our Service to connect with Facebook, you will be able to use your Facebook login information to log into our Service, and we will publish certain of your activities on the Service to your Facebook profile and/or wall. If you no longer want the Service to publish stories about you on Facebook, or want to otherwise limit the ways in which the Service interacts with your Facebook account, you should review and, if appropriate, modify your privacy settings on Facebook.</p>
	<p>We also collect and store any other personal information and other data you have provided to us via our Service, by email, or otherwise.</p>
	<p>We use the information we obtain about you from Facebook, as well as other information that you may provide to us, to respond to any inquiries you may submit to us, to track and monitor usage of our Service and to communicate with you about your account and your use of our Service. In addition, we may use this information to send you periodic publications associated with RootMusic, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications via email. We also use this information to operate our Service; for example, to facilitate postings on interactive areas of our Services. We also use this information, along with other information we collect about you, for targeted advertising and other marketing purposes.</p>
	<h4>Website Information</h4>
	<p>Our Service collects and stores information that is generated automatically as you use our Service. This information is collected site-wide, and includes anonymous website statistics. To collect this information, we may use standard log files, “clear gifs,” also known as Web beacons, and cookies. For example, our Service employs browser cookies to store users’ preferences and record session information. “Cookies” are bits of information that are stored by your browser on your hard drive. This technology allows for the storage of user preferences, user ID and password, if applicable, and remembers you when you take action on our Service. You can turn off the “cookie” function through most standard browsers; however, the majority of the features on our Service may not function properly, including but not limited to, the login function, if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
	<p>In addition, when you use our Service our system automatically collects certain information. For example, when you visit our website, our system automatically collects information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, browser language, domain names, referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of these page views, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request and the unique identity of your browser. This information is used to analyze trends, administer our Service, improve the design of our Service, track user movement, and otherwise enhance the services we provide.</p>
	<h4>Credit Card Information</h4>
	<p>For users that purchase our BandPage Plus services, we collect credit card information (including the credit card number and expiration date; verification code (CVV code); and the user’s name, billing address, email address, and telephone number). We transmit this credit card information to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.</p>
	<h4>Information from Promotions</h4>
	<p>We collect information you give us when you participate in a RootMusic promotion, such as a sweepstakes or contest. Specifically, you will typically be asked to provide your name, email address, and mailing address.</p> 
	<p>We store this information in our database and will use it to communicate with you about the promotion. We may also use this information to promote our services to you in the future, unless you opt out from receiving such communications.</p>
	<h4>Other Information</h4>
	<p>We may retain any data you provide to us in an email or other inquiry, to track the types of questions we receive, analyze trends, administer the websites and services we offer, improve the design of our websites and services we offer, track user movement, and otherwise enhance the services we provide.</p>
	<h4>Aggregated Information</h4>
	<p>We may collect or create data about users of the Service that has been aggregated with other similar data, or from which personal information otherwise has been removed. We may use and disclose this non-personally identifiable data for various purposes, but will do so in an aggregated manner or otherwise in a way that does not identify our users personally.</p>
	<h3>WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED</h3>
	<p>If you join our Service as an administrator for an artist or a band, you may, at your option, choose to input a contact email address, a URL for a website for the artist or band, a telephone number, and a biography for that band. This information will be displayed on your BandPage on our Service. Additionally, we may share this information with third-party services that display information originally displayed on our Service.</p>
	<p>Additionally, if you elect to join the mailing list for an artist or band, we will provide the artist or band, or its management, your email address and your location (that is, the location you have entered in your profile on Facebook, which typically is a city). Once we provide an artist or band, or its management, with this information, it will be used and disclosed by that artist or band, or its management, in accordance with its own privacy practices and policies.</p>
	<p>We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. In particular, we will disclose personal information where you have elected to connect your account on our Service to Facebook or have elected to have your activity on our Service published to Facebook. To control the information that your share, you should review and, if appropriate, modify your privacy settings on Facebook.</p>
	<p>We may provide your personal information to third parties for their use in performing internal business functions (e.g., payment processing, data analysis, email transmission, or data hosting) on our behalf. Additionally, some third-party service providers may collect information, including personal information, on our Service on our behalf. In our agreements with these third-party service providers, we require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of such personal information and to use it only for the purpose of providing their services to us.</p>
	<p>We will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any of the information about you in our possession, and we may use such information to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend against legal claims. We reserve the right to disclose information about you, including data on which pages you have visited and other information regarding your use of the Service, to third parties if we feel it is necessary to protect our systems, website, business, users or others.</p>
	<p>In addition, information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. RootMusic does not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this policy.</p>
	<h3>OPT OUT</h3>
	<p>As noted, once you register with RootMusic, we may send you administrative-related emails, as well as emails to facilitate your access to RootMusic’s services, including providing you with related updates. We may not offer you the opportunity to opt out of receiving these communications.</p>
	<p>However, we provide you with the opportunity to elect not to receive other types of communications, including emails informing you about RootMusic’s services and other offerings that we think will interest you. If you want to stop receiving these communications, click on the “Unsubscribe” link in any such email, or contact use via email at support@rootmusic.com.</p>
	<h3>SECURITY</h3>
	<p>Whenever RootMusic handles information that you disclose on our Service, regardless of where this occurs, we take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. RootMusic uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information that we collect on our Service. Certain information transmitted through our Service, such as login information (with the exception of the Forum login) and information relating to the purchase of our services, is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology or similar encryption technology. Unfortunately, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive personal information from you, we use commercially reasonable safeguards to ensure its security on our systems but we do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.</p>
 	<h3>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h3>
	<p>Although our Service may be accessed by children under the age of 13, we will not knowingly collect, maintain or use any personal information from such children, and no part of our Service is directed to persons under the age of 13. In fact, you must be at least 13 years of age to set up an account with us. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS ROOTMUSIC’S SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.</p>
	<p>If we become aware that we have collected any personal information from children under 13, we will promptly delete such information from our databases. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained a RootMusic account, then you may alert RootMusic at support@rootmusic.com and request that we delete that child’s personal information from our systems.</p>
	<h3>OTHER WEBSITES AND ONLINE SERVICES</h3>
	<p>For your convenience, our Service may contain links to other websites and online services, or you may be otherwise referred to other websites and online services. This privacy policy does not apply to these linked websites and services. Each website and service should be checked for its own privacy policy.</p>
	<h3>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h3>
	<p>RootMusic may from time to time update this privacy policy. In the event that RootMusic merges with, or is acquired by another company, a change to this privacy policy may result. Whenever a change to this policy is significant, we will place a prominent notice on our Service.</p>
	
	<h3>GOVERNING LAW</h3>
	<p>Our Service is controlled by RootMusic from our offices within the State of California, United States of America. By choosing to visit our Service or otherwise provide information to RootMusic, you agree that any dispute over privacy or the terms contained in this privacy policy will be governed by the law of the State of California. If you are accessing our Service from any region with regulations or laws governing personal data collection, use or disclosure that differ from United States laws or regulations, please note that through your continued use of our Service, which is governed by the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, this privacy policy and our Terms of Use (available <a href="/terms">here</a> and/or at http://www.rootmusic.com/terms), you are transferring personal information to the United States of America and you consent to that transfer. You also consent to the adjudication of any disputes arising in connection with our Service in the federal and state courts of San Francisco County in the State of California. You also agree to arbitrate such disputes and to abide by any limitation on damages contained in our Terms of Use or any other agreement we may have with you.</p>
	<h3>UPDATE INFORMATION / SUGGESTIONS</h3>
	<p>If you would like to update or correct any information that you have provided to RootMusic through your use of our Service or otherwise, or you have suggestions for improving this privacy policy, please send an email to support@rootmusic.com.</p>
