We may also collect other information based on your location and your Device’s proximity to “beacons” and other similar proximity systems, including, for example, the strength of the signal between the “beacon” and your Device and the duration that your Device is near the “beacon”. The type of location data we collect depends on a number of factors, including the type of Device you are using (e.g., laptop, smartphone, tablet) and the type of connection enabled on your Device (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, broadband cable). If you agree to allow access to your location, you agree that we and our service providers may collect such location-based information from your Device. We may use and share that location-based information with third parties to deliver, market and promote the content, services, features, products and advertising (and/or to verify your rights to receive such content, services, features and/or products) that are available through the Services. If you no longer wish to have this location information collected and used by us, you may “opt-out” by disabling the location and Bluetooth features in the operating system of your Device and/or in the Bandsintown App.<br></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Music DNA: </strong>When you create an account, we will ask to scan the music library on your device, your social media accounts, and music subscription services in order to create a unique “music DNA”, which is your digital identity based on your music tastes. We will develop and refine your music DNA based on Artists you like while using the Services, Artists’ pages you follow and events you state you are attending. We will make additional music suggestions based on your music DNA. We will also use your Music DNA to provide relevant promotional emails and other forms of advertising to you. If you limit our ability to scan your music library, social media or music services, we may not be able to offer you tailored music experiences and suggestions.<br></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Third Party Platform Information: </strong>If you access the Services via your Third Party Platform account (e.g., by logging in to the Services using your Third Party Platform account credentials from third parties like Apple (iTunes, etc.), Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, Last.fm, and Pandora) and/or integrate your Bandsintown account with your Third Party Platform account, we may collect certain information about you from the Third Party Platform, such as your username, email address, music preferences and other information you provided to the Third Party Platform in connection with your account (name, country, date of birth, friend connections, user posts, profile picture, RSVPs, Artist and event page visits, credit card, Device ID, gender and e-mail address). We use this information to further enhance your Bandsintown user profile and to inform your Music DNA within the Bandsintown system. If you do not connect Bandsintown to a Third Party Platform, or otherwise disconnect your Bandsintown account from such Third Party Platform, that may limit our collection of certain Information about you, which may limit your ability to use certain features of the Services.<br></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Personal Information You Choose to Provide to Obtain Additional Services: </strong>We may collect Personal Information that you choose to provide to us when you elect to participate in optional Site-features or Services.

In addition, the Services and/or third parties may use “cookies” (which are small data files containing information about you that is stored on your device), “embedded scripts”, and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to collect Additional Information automatically as you interact with the Services. Information processed by Tracking Technologies will be processed in accordance with our Cookie Policy located <a href="http://corp.bandsintown.com/cookie-policy">here</a>.<br></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Third Party Advertising: </strong>As part of the Services and in accordance with our <a href="http://corp.bandsintown.com/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>, we may also use a variety of third parties, including advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers and marketing analytics service providers to, for example, serve advertisements on the Services, populate user-specific advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on or in connection with the Services (“Third Party Advertising Providers”). Such Third Party Advertising Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your use of the Services and other websites, services and platforms you have used or visited. These Third Party Advertising Providers may use their own Tracking Technologies (as described above) to collect similar Information. Bandsintown does not control these Third Party Advertising Providers and/or their use of Tracking Technologies, which is instead governed by the privacy policies of any such Third Party Advertising Provider.
