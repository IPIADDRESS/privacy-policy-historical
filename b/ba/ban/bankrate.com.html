      <p class="body">You expressly agree to Bankrate's use of your personally identifiable information as set forth in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.  </p>

      <p class="body"><span class="subhead">Disclosure of Personally Identifiable  Information</span><br>
    Unless you are entering one of Bankrateâs sweepstakes, Bankrate does not currently sell your personally identifiable information. The following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business: </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="body"><span class="leadin">Advertisers.</span> Bankrate may aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. For example, Bankrate may aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose it to network advertisers in a non-personally identifiable manner as set forth in the section entitled "Network Advertisers," set forth below. Bankrate does not disclose your information in a personally identifiable manner to such third party advertisers without your consent.   </li>
      
             <li class="body"><span class="leadin">External Service Providers.</span> There are a number of separate services offered by third parties, including, without limitation, Bankrateâs affiliates, that Bankrate refers to as external service providers that may be complementary to your use of www.bankrate.com (e.g. realtors, mortgage brokers, lenders, financial institutions, credit card issuers, information aggregators). If you choose to use these separate services, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy. With your consent, Bankrate may provide some of your personal information to the external service provider offering such services, for your convenience. To prevent Bankrateâs disclosure of your personally identifiable information to an external service provider, you can decline such consent or simply not use their services. You should evaluate the practices of external services providers before deciding to use their services. 
</li>
    
        <li class="body"><span class="leadin">Internal Service Providers.</span> Bankrate may use third parties that Bankrate refers to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of Bankrateâs business, product and service operations that Bankrate provides to you (e.g., technology, Forums, newsletters/alerts, analytical tools, advertising campaign management) and therefore Bankrate may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers. These internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with Bankrate or other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information Bankrate provides them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced Bankrate related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. In some instances, the internal service provider may collect information directly from you. In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your personally identifiable information is governed by their applicable privacy policy. </li>
      </ul>
     
      <p class="body">Notwithstanding the foregoing, Bankrate reserves the right (and you authorize Bankrate) to share or disclose your personally identifiable information when Bankrate determines, in its sole discretion, that the disclosure of your personally identifiable information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you if: </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="body">you are or may be violating this Privacy Policy or Bankrateâs Terms of Use; </li>
              <li class="body">you are interfering with another's rights or property, including, without limitation, Bankrate's rights or property; </li>
             <li class="body">you are violating any applicable law, rule or regulation; </li>
     
        <li class="body">necessary or required by any applicable law, rule or regulation; and/or </li>
    
        <li class="body">requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or instance of local, regional or national emergency. </li>
      </ul>
     
      <p class="body">Personally identifiable information and other personal information collected from you may also be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger, reorganization, other transfer or bankruptcy (a âTransferâ) involving Bankrate and/or its affiliates. Bankrate specifically reserves the right to transfer personally identifiable information collected from www.bankrate.com, and any of its databases, together with any personally identifiable information contained therein, to a third party in connection with a Transfer, and nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Bankrate to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets (including www.bankrate.com) to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever. 
</p>
      <p class="body">In addition, due to the existing regulatory environment, Bankrate cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), Bankrate may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although Bankrate uses industry standard practices to protect your privacy, Bankrate does not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private. </p>
      <p class="body"><b>NOTE: If you are submitting personally identifiable information pursuant to sweepstakes entry, Bankrate reserves the right to share, loan, rent and/or sell the personally identifiable information that you submit with its affiliates and other third parties. Please refer to the Official Rules and Privacy Policy for each individual sweepstakes for the specific guidelines regarding information sharing and disclosure. </b></p>

Bankrate, and its external service providers, internal service providers, and third-party advertising companies gather anonymous information about you through cookie technology on an aggregate level only. For example, a third-party advertising company may assign a cookie (and a Web beacon, described below) to you, to limit the amount of times you see a particular advertisement or to help better determine which advertisements to serve to you. Please note that most Internet browsers will allow you to stop cookies from being stored on your computer and to delete cookies stored on your computer. </p>
     
      <p class="body"><span class="subhead">Web  beacons</span><br>

        <li><strong>Email.</strong> Bankrate may include Web beacons in HTML-formatted email messages that Bankrate or its affiliates or agents send. Including Web beacons in email messages helps Bankrate determine your interest in and the effectiveness of such emails. </li>

        <li><strong>External use of Web beacons.</strong> Bankrate may also use Web beacons externally. For example, Bankrate may report aggregate information about Bankrate.com users, such as demographic and usage information, to its partners and other third parties.
