At Bank of Ireland Group we are committed to ensuring the privacy of your information.<br><br>

We understand that as a customer or visitor using the Bank of Ireland Group Website, the privacy and the security of your information is very important to you. The purpose of our Privacy Policy is to outline Bank of Ireland Group's practices in this area.<br><br><strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong> that this Privacy Policy is subject to the Terms and Conditions of Use of the Bank of Ireland Group Website. You can read a copy of the Terms and Conditions of Use by clicking here. We recommend that you read the Terms and Conditions of Use. If there is a conflict between the Terms and Conditions of Use and this Privacy Policy, the Terms and Conditions of Use shall prevail. Except as otherwise provided, terms used herein and defined in the Terms and Conditions of Use shall have the same meaning that is given to them in the Terms and Conditions of Use.<br><br>

The contents of this Privacy Policy are subject to change and to being updated without notice from time to time.<br><br><strong>The information we collect</strong><br><br>

As you browse through our Website, our web server collects information about your visit, not about you personally. We gather and monitor statistics such as, for example:<br><br>

- the number of people who visit the Website;<br>
- the date and time of visits;<br>
- the number of pages viewed;<br>
- the amount of time spent on the Website;<br>
- the most popular sections of the Website<br><br>

This information is anonymous and no attempt is or will be made to identify visitors. So, for example, on a specific day we can identify that our site has forty thousand visitors. However, we know nothing about these visitors in terms of e-mail addresses or any other personal information.<br><br>

We only ask and will only ask for personal information from which you can be identified where the information is required for particular purposes e.g. applying online for a credit card, mortgage or personal loan. Examples of details that may be sought include your name, address, e-mail address, etc. (Please note in the regard the paragraph headed Internet fraud below)<br><br>

All information provided to us by you will be treated with the utmost confidentiality in accordance with all applicable legislative and regulatory standards.

The Bank of Ireland Group Website does not use cookies. This is to further protect the confidentiality, anonymity and security of your personal information.<br><br>

(A cookie is a small piece of information that a website stores through your web browser on your PC that it can later retrieve when you log back onto that website.

At Bank of Ireland Group, we understand how important the security and confidentiality of your information is to you. Keeping customer information secure is a top priority for Bank of Ireland Group.

The use by you of this Website is at your sole risk.<br><br><strong>Internet Fraud</strong><br><br>

A number of banking organisations and their customers have recently been the target of hoax e-mails that are aimed at gathering Internet/account details of the customers. Some of these hoax e-mails have encouraged or facilitated contact with hoax websites that purport to be (but are not) the website of the relevant banking organisation. To date the occurrence of such online fraud has not been extensive. However, we would always advise you to be cautious as regards disclosing your personal details. In particular, you should note that we will only ever request your personal details if: (i) you are seeking to initiate e-mail contact with us via this Website; or (ii) you initiate a request for a particular service via this Website and we require certain of your personal details to provide you with the requested service and the requested service is a loan/credit card application, a mortgage application, a request for a telephone call from a sales advisor, or a request for a pensions information pack or other product information.<br><br><strong>Hyperlinks</strong><br><br>
