				<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
				<h3>Privacy Policy  </h3>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>At First American Bank, respecting the privacy and security of your personal   information is important to us. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. It is   designed to inform you of the information we collect, how we use that   information, and the circumstances under which we will share it with   nonaffiliated third parties. </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Consumer Data Protection and Privacy Practices</strong> </p>
				<p>The bank's board of directors and staff believe it is important to inform you   of the data protection and privacy practices that we have instituted to   safeguard information received from or about our customers. We have established   an information security program to ensure privacy of information. This program   includes: </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<ul>
                  <li>Defined control methods to limit access to customer's electronic   information. </li>
				  <li>Established procedures and restrictions on disclosure of customer's account   information. </li>
				  <li>Reviewed third-party service and business arrangements for consumer data   privacy. </li>
				  <li>Defined standards for consumer data collection, use and methods of storage. </li>
		      </ul>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>It is First American Bank's practice to grant access of nonpublic personal   information to our employees as needed to provide or offer products or services   to you, process and service your accounts, and administer business. All of our   employees are required to follow our Bank's "Code of Ethics" policy that   addresses the protection of your confidential information. Also, our employees   are provided with training on our privacy policy, information security program,   and procedures. </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Collection and Use of Customer Information</strong> </p>
				<p>We collect, retain and use nonpublic personal information about you only   where we reasonably believe that it will help administer our business of   providing products, services, and other opportunities to you. Nonpublic personal   information is collected about you from various sources, including: </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<ul>
                  <li>Information we receive from you on applications, deposit agreements or other   forms. This information may include your name, address, employment information,   income and credit references; </li>
				  <li>Information about your transactions with us or others. This information may   include account balances and payment history; </li>
				  <li>Information we receive from a consumer-reporting agency. This information   may include account information and information about your creditworthiness; </li>
		      </ul>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The information that we receive is used to administer your records, accounts,   and funds; to comply with certain laws and regulations; to help us design and   improve our products and services; and to understand your financial needs so   that we can provide you with quality products and superior service.</p>
				<p>&nbsp; </p>
				<p><strong>Sharing of Consumer Information</strong> </p>
				<p><u>We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you to anyone,   except as permitted by law. </u></p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The law does permit us to disclose nonpublic personal information to (1)   companies that perform marketing services on our behalf and (2) with other   financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. The   information disclosed may include that information that is described above under   "Collection and Use of Customer Information". The information disclosed would be   limited to only that which we deem appropriate for the marketing or financial   service provider to carry out their functions, such as name, address and   telephone numbers. An example of a joint marketing arrangement would be if we   disclosed the information mentioned to an investment center located within our   banking center locations, that is not an affiliate of First American Bank but   with whom we have established a joint marketing agreement. </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>We do not share your nonpublic personal information for the purpose of credit   card sales for non-affiliated third party solicitors. Any credit card   applications found within our banking center locations, are placed there for our   customer's convenience. You, the customer, would complete the application   providing the credit card solicitor with your nonpublic personal information and   mail the application to the third party direct. This is an example of a   marketing service provided on our behalf. </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>We may also provide information about you, as described above, to other   nonaffiliated third parties such as service providers that help us process your   applications or service your accounts. Our service providers may include a third   party that prints your checks; our data processing center; external auditing   firm; secondary market mortgage investors; attorneys; and loan settlement   service providers such as an appraiser or title company. Examples of another   nonaffiliated third party would be a credit reporting agency to whom we report   information about your transactions with us. </p>
				<p>Even if you are no longer a First American Bank customer, our Privacy Policy   will continue to apply to you. </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>If you have any questions  concerning this privacy notice, please call us at 800.522.1262 or 405.579.7000 or visit your nearest banking center location.</p>
