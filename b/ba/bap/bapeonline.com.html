(c) the kind of Personal Data being held by I.T.<br>

We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
</div>

<div class="accordion">VII. Security</div>

<div class="panel">
<p>1. Data security is our top priority. We strive to ensure that your Personal Data will be protected against unauthorized or accidental access, processing or erasure. In addition, we limit access to your Personal Data to our employees, officers, as well as our contractors / service providers of I.T Group (who are engaged by us to assist with providing you our services) who have a business need to know. They will only process your Personal Data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We maintain this commitment to data security by implementing appropriate physical, electronic and managerial measures to safeguard and secure your Personal Data. Encryption technology, such as SSL (as described in more detail in the paragraph below), may be employed for the transmission of Personal Data collected online. Also, our web servers are protected by data security measures and our systems are monitored to prevent any unauthorized access. However, you are also invited to protect against unauthorised access to your Membership or log-in account, password, payment and credit card details, and delivery details. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.<br>
2. We value and respect your Personal Data, privacy and shopping experience. Therefore, safety retention of your Personal Data is our primary task. We strive to ensure that your Personal Data will not be used, stolen or deleted without your permission. We have a set of electronic and systematic safety measures in place that conform to the regulations for Personal Data protection. When the collected Personal Data is transmitted via online, we may use coding technology such as SSL for the transmission. Sensitive personal information that is included in online orders is protected by 128-bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. This is a technology that is used to ensure the security of online transactions. The technology provides safety and protection for transactions by the use of other basic functions such as mutual authentication, data encryption and data integrity.<br>
3. Despite our efforts to protect your Personal Data, you should acknowledge that:<br>
(a) there are limitations to the safety and privacy of the Internet which are out of our control;<br>
(b) the security, completeness and privacy of information and data exchanges through the Internet cannot be protected completely;<br>
(c) information and data may be viewed or falsified by a third party during its transmission; and<br>
(d) you shall bear the risk when you transmit any information to us; and in no event shall BAPEONLINE be liable to you or any third party for any loss and damage.</p>
</div>

<div class="accordion">VIII. Retention of Personal Data</div>

<div class="panel">
<p>Your Personal Data will only be retained for as long as is necessary to fulfill the original purpose for which it was collected, unless contrary to any applicable statutory requirement. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements. You may contact us for further details of retention periods on different aspects of your Personal Data. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your Personal Data: see Section XII Your Legal Rights below for further information. In some circumstances we will anonymise your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
</div>

<div class="accordion">IX. Amendment to this Privacy Policy</div>

<div class="panel">
<p>1. We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any substantial amendments in the way we use your Personal Data, we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on the BAPEONLINE Website. You agree that such posting will constitute sufficient and adequate notice to you of the amendments.<br>
2. You agree that your continued use of our products or services after such amendment will constitute your acceptance of and agreement to be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.</p>
</div>

<div class="accordion">X. Direct Marketing</div>

<div class="panel">
<p>I.T may contact you from time to time with a view to providing the latest information on our products and services / Membership program. If you do not wish to receive these updates, please login at https://www.bapeonline.com/account to unsubscribe. Alternatively, you may click the unsubscribe link as shown in our electronic promotional materials; or write to us (See Section XIV Contact Us). In accordance with the statutory requirements, I.T will honour your request not to use your Personal Data for the purposes of direct marketing. Unless otherwise instructed as per the above, I.T may use any of your Personal Data collected in the normal course of our business for direct marketing purposes. Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to Personal Data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions.</p>
</div>

<div class="accordion">XI. Links to third parties’ websites</div>

<div class="panel">BAPEONLINE Website may contain links to third parties’ websites that are operated under different privacy policy and are totally independent from us. I.T is not responsible for the contents on such websites or how information is collected. You should read and understand the privacy policy of any such third parties’ websites before submitting any Personal Data to them.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="accordion">XII. Your Legal Rights</div>

<div class="panel">
<p>You have the right to:<br>
Request access to your Personal Data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.<br>
Request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.<br>
Request erasure of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Data to comply with the law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.<br>
Object to processing of your Personal Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.<br>
Request restriction of processing of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Data in the following scenarios:<br>
(a) If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.<br>
(b) Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.<br>
(c) Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.<br>
(d) You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.<br>
Request the transfer of your Personal Data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.<br>
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.<br>
If you believe that the processing of your personal data has been carried out unlawfully, you can file a complaint with the regulatory body responsible for compliance with the rules on personal data protection in your jurisdiction. We would appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the related regulatory body and so please contact us in the first instance.</p>
</div>

<div class="accordion">XIII. International Transfers</div>

<div class="panel">
<p>1. We share your Personal Data within the I.T Group. This will involve transferring your Personal Data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).<br>
2. We ensure your Personal Data is protected by requiring all our group companies to follow the same rules when processing your Personal Data.<br>
3. Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your Personal Data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. Whenever we transfer your Personal Data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented :<br>
(a) We will only transfer your Personal Data to countries / regions that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data by the European Commission.<br>
(b) Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give Personal Data the same protection it has in Europe.<br>
4. Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Data out of the EEA.</p>
