<h2 id="information-we-collect-through-the-bazaarvoice-network">Information We Collect Through the Bazaarvoice Network</h2>
<h3 id="information-you-submit">Information You Submit</h3>
<p><strong>User-Generated Content</strong>. As part of our Services to our Clients, we provide Consumers the ability to submit reviews, and to comment on or rate goods, products and services on websites and mobile applications within the Bazaarvoice Network (collectively, âUser-Generated Contentâ). You should be aware that any information you provide in the area that is intended to collect such User-Generated Content will be published on a publicly facing website or mobile application and will be read, collected, and used by Bazaarvoice, its subsidiaries, vendors and Clients. Therefore, please do not include any information within these areas that you do not want to share with the general public, including personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address or financial information. Bazaarvoice uses User-Generated Content for providing the Services to our Clients, marketing research, new product development, to personalize or improve our Services, to detect fraudulent activities and for analytical purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer Account Info.</strong> In order to submit User-Generated Content, you may have to create an account with the Bazaarvoice Client whose products, services or goods you are reviewing or rating. During the course of creating an account, you may be asked to submit information, such as but not limited to, your name, email address, mailing address or phone number, and other data (collectively, "Consumer Account Info"). The Consumer Account Info may be collected by both Bazaarvoice and the applicable Bazaarvoice Client. Bazaarvoice uses Consumer Account Info to assist with the creation of an account, to detect fraud and inauthentic content, to personalize your services, to provide you the ability to review, comment on or rate products, or to otherwise create content across Client websites on the Bazaarvoice Network.</p>
<p><strong>How Bazaarvoiceâs Clients Use User-Generated Content and Consumer Account Info</strong>. To further understand how the Bazaarvoice Client to whom you have submitted User-Generated Content and Consumer Account Info will use such data, please consult the terms and conditions on that Clientâs website (e.g. the privacy policy).</p>
<h3 id="data-collection-technologies">Data Collection Technologies</h3>

Our technologies may collect the IP address of your computer, the pages you visit within the Bazaarvoice Network, the date and time of your visit, browser type and version, and other click-stream data (collectively âAnalytics and Tracking Dataâ). We use the Analytics and Tracking Data to operate the Services, enable the submission of User-Generated Content, to enable anonymous analytics and measurement reporting, and to display online advertisements to you and other users.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Technologies on the Bazaarvoice Network.</strong> We and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to collect information from Consumers on the Bazaarvoice Network. We do so to analyze trends, administer and track usersâ movements around the Bazaarvoice Network, and to gather demographic info about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p><em>Web Beacons</em>. Web beacons are small, graphic images on web pages or web-based documents or in email messages. We use web beacons in order to personalize your experience on the Bazaarvoice Network, determine the usefulness of the information our Services provide and to analyze general user traffic patterns.  We also use web beacons as a way to transmit Consumer Account Info.</p>

You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions of a website or service.</p>
<p><em>Mobile Advertising Identifiers:</em> If Bazaarvoice technology is enabled in a Bazaarvoice Client mobile app, Bazaarvoice collects the advertising identifier of your mobile device. Your information is combined across all apps using Bazaarvoice technology on the same device.<br>
We use mobile analytics to allow us to better understand the functionality of our technology on your mobile device. This may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within our mobile analytics to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.</p>
<p><em>Precise Location Data:</em> If a Bazaarvoice Client has enabled certain Bazaarvoice technology in their mobile application, your precise location may be collected in certain contexts with your express permission. You may opt-out of location-based services at any time by editing the setting at the device level.</p>
