<p>Flycast, and its advertisers and affiliates are deeply committed
to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below is information
outlining our continued support for the responsible management of
consumer information.</p>

<p>Consumer Information</p>

<p>During the process of delivering an ad to you, Flycast does not
collect any personally identifiable information about you such as
name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, Flycast does
obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as
the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet,
your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use
(Macintosh or Windows, for example). The information collected by
Flycast is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad
effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers.</p>

<p>If you would like additional information about the types of
non-personally identifiable information that is collected by Flycast
please <a href="#top">visit the above sites</a>.</p>

<p>In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in
response to a specific ad (this ad may ask you to fill out a survey
or provide your zip code). If this does occur, Flycast may collect
this information on behalf of an advertiser. This information is used
by an advertiser to respond to your request. In addition, Flycast may
combine this information with other users' information and review it
in an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a
specific type of ad or visit a particular kind of website.</p>

<p>Data Collection and Opt Out</p>

<p>Flycast, as well as most sites on the Internet, use "cookies" to
enhance your experience on the web. Flycast cannot use these cookies
to personally identify you in any way. What are cookies and why do we
use them? A cookie is a unique number that is provided to you the
first time Flycast serves you an ad. This unique number, which is
stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps Flycast target ads to
you. This cookie can help Flycast ensure that we don't serve you the
same ad multiple times, and help our advertisers understand what you
like and don't like about their offerings so that they can cater
better to your needs the next time you are interested in their
products or services. While we believe that cookies enhance your
Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the same
ad and delivering more relevant content to you, they are not required
for Flycast to deliver you an ad.</p>

<p>If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple
procedure to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web
browser's Help documentation for more information.</p>

<p>Opt Out Procedure</p>

<p>If you would like to "opt out," that is, to prevent any data from
being stored by Flycast, please <a href="#top">visit the above
sites</a>.</p>

<p>Participation in Industry-side Privacy Initiatives</p>

<p>Flycast works with several recognized trade associations and
privacy groups that are both actively shaping privacy policies and
support consumer privacy. We are actively participating in the Direct
Marketing Association's efforts to establish industry guidelines that
safeguard the right to privacy, and are members of the Ad Club of New
York, the New York New Media Association, the Interactive Advertising
Bureau.</p>

consumer privacy, please contact them at <a href="mailto:info@flycast.com">info@flycast.com</a>.</p>
