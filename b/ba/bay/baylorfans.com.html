Many good threads have been derailed in the past because they have devolved from constructive debate into name calling.<br><br>Criticisms of coaches or administrators at Baylor needs to be kept to their official capacities as coach or administrator. Attacking these individuals personally is not an appropriate discourse on this forum. This includes calling for the firing of a coach or administrator. In no way does this mean that we agree with the performance of a coach, or are hedging our alignment with a coaching staff or athletic department.<br><br><b>Posting pictures and hyperlinks</b><br>All images need to be work safe.

If an account is found to be shared among more than one person, an indefinite suspension will be placed on the account until the user contacts customer support.<br><br>Usernames cannot directly reflect the name of a business or organization that is not a current advertiser without explicit, prior permission from SicEm365.<br><br>A username may be changed with good reason and at a reasonable frequency by emailing customer support.
