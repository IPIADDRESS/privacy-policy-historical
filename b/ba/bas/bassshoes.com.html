<h1>Our Privacy Commitment</h1>
<p><br>
Effective Date: March 19, 2009 <br>
<br>
Thank you for visiting the BassShoes.com web site operated by “Harbor Wholesale, Ltd. And Affiliates”. Your privacy is important to us at Bass Shoes.com (“Bass Shoes”,” we” or “us”). This online privacy policy explains our practices related to the information collected via this web site and how your privacy is protected. <br>
<br>
By accessing the Site, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site. Each time you use the Site, the current version of the Privacy Policy will apply. We reserve the right to revise this privacy policy at any time. We will notify you of any changes to this privacy policy by posting a new policy here and changing the “Effective date”. <br>
<br>
The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Information We Collect <br>
<br>
</strong>We may collect two types of information from users of the Site: “personally identifiable information” which means any information by which a user can be personally identified (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, billing and account number, credit card information, and other information incidental to providing goods and services) and “aggregate information” which means information that would not permit the personal identification of a user (such as IP address, frequency of visits to the Site and Site pages most frequently accessed). <br>
<br>
<strong>Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information</strong> <br>
<br>
BassShoes.com collects personally identifiable information that is voluntarily provided by users of the Site, such as when placing an order on the Site, creating an account, contacting us with a question or comment, utilizing an “Email to a Friend” or wish list feature, or signing up to receive emails about our latest products and services. In addition, BassShoes.com may conduct surveys on the Site where users can voluntarily participate and provide personally identifiable information. We will maintain a record of your purchases or the types of products that appeal to you by using “Wish List” feature. By providing personally identifiable information to us, we are better to service your interests. BassShoes.com may use your personally identifiable information for various purposes such as to help us improve our Site, improve products, services and marketing efforts, and to provide content on the Site or inform you of upcoming promotions and other product or service offerings that may be of interest to you. <br>
<br>
<strong>Collection and Use of Aggregate Information</strong> <br>
<br>
BassShoes.com collects aggregate information, which is used in a collective manner, and no individual person can be identified by this compiled information. The types of aggregate information we collect include frequency of visits to the Site, search terms entered, Site pages most frequently accessed; location, age or gender of users; and types of products that are of greatest interest to our customers. By knowing more about the general profile or our customers (without identifying any specific individual characteristics), we believe we can improve your shopping experience. <br>
<br>
<strong>Sharing, Selling and Trading Personally Identifiable Information Collected Online With Third Parties</strong> <br>
<br>
BassShoes.com will not rent, sell or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information, without your consent, to unrelated third parties, except as stated in this Privacy Policy. BassShoes.com may share or disclose your personally identifiable information to its parent or affiliates in connection with our internal business purposes. In addition, we may share your personally identifiable information with our third party service providers that provide assistance with operating or hosting the Site, providing or fulfilling the products and services you request through this Site, authorizing and processing of your payments, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, product customization, marketing and promotional material distribution, web site evaluation, data analysis, Site improvements, and, where applicable, data cleansing, and marketing, promotions and other services performed on our behalf. <br>
<br>
In addition, the BassShoes.com and our affiliate companies may share or transfer personally identifiable information to unrelated third parties: if required to do so by law or to comply with a legal requirement, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process; to investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; or when we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of the BassShoes.com party or other persons. All third parties are contractually bound to use the Personally Identifiable Information only according to this privacy policy. They are not authorized to send you any information about goods and services from other companies without your permission. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, merger, acquisition, reorganization, receivership, this privacy policy is null and void in its entirety, and we may sell, transfer or auction any and all information, including customer and personal information, in any manner in our sole discretion. <br>
<br>
We may use certain aggregate information for research or marketing purposes and may share, trade or publish that aggregate information and statistical data derived from such information with our parent, affiliates or third parties for research or marketing purposes. We do not use aggregate information to identify a particular individual. <br>
<br>
<strong>Security</strong> <br>
<br>
Security of your personally identifiable information is important to us at BassShoes.com. We are committed to handling such sensitive information carefully.
