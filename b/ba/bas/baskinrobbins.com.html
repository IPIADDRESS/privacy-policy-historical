					</p><p>Baskin-Robbins reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Be sure to check this page periodically for updates.

					<p><span class="lightblue">Inquiries.</span> To best respond to your comments when you request information from Baskin-Robbins or share an experience you had at one of our stores, we'll ask for personal information.

					</p><p><span class="lightblue">Promotional Events.</span> When you choose to take part in a promotional event we'll ask for information necessary for the event, such as your name, email address and shipping address. On occasion, we may co-sponsor promotions with third parties. Before entering your data you will be notified if third parties will obtain your personal information.
					</p><p><span class="lightblue">Surveys.</span> From time-to-time we may post surveys which request demographic information such as age range, gender, areas of interest and familiarity with Baskin-Robbins products and services, as well as customer feedback. Participation in these requests is completely voluntary. With each request you will have the choice of whether or not to disclose information.

					</p><p><span class="lightblue">Franchise Applications.</span> If you choose, you may submit an electronic application seeking consideration as a prospective franchisee via the Franchise Opportunity Web site. If you submit an electronic application, we will collect your name, date of birth, social security number, address, email address, other contact information and certain financial and employment information that you must enter on the form.

We do not authorize unaffiliated third parties to use your personal information for any purpose other than consideration of your inquiry or application.
					</p><p><span class="lightblue">Aggregate Information.</span> We collect Aggregate Information about you and your use of our Web site whenever you visit us online. Aggregate Information includes various forms of "click stream" information, such as entry and exit points for our Web site (i.e., referring URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, operating system and browser type. In addition, when you request pages on our Web site, our servers automatically log your IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your web service whenever you are surfing the Web.
					
					</p><p>Traffic directed to BaskinRobbins.com from affiliate Web sites and the purchases that result from this traffic is also tracked by third-party software. This information is aggregated and is not tied to an individual purchase.
					</p><p>This Aggregate Information generally will not personally identify you or be correlated to you individually for external purposes. We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell or otherwise disclose or use any and all Aggregate Information, provided that such information does not personally identify you. When we share such information with other companies, it is not traceable to any particular user and will not be used to contact you. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, such information will be treated like any other Personal Information under this Policy.

					<p>Baskin-Robbins recognizes the need to provide additional privacy protection to children. Children 12-years-old and younger may visit BaskinRobbins.com without disclosing any personally identifiable information. However, it is sometimes necessary to collect some personally identifiable information about children in order to allow them to use a feature of our site (like joining the Baskin-Robbins Birthday Club). In addition, be aware that all sites that are targeted to children 12 and younger are prohibited by law from collecting more information than they need.
					</p><p>Only a parent or guardian may register a child 12 or younger for the Baskin-Robbins Birthday Club. When a parent registers a child for the Birthday Club, we request the child's name, date of birth and parent's e-mail address. We collect this information in order to verify the child's age, send personalized Birthday Club emails, and provide other Birthday Club benefits (such as promotions and special offers). Parents may review and edit this information at any time by going to their Birthday Club account on BaskinRobbins.com.
					</p><p>We will not disclose any children's information to anyone outside of Baskin-Robbins, our sister brand, Dunkin' Donuts, and our agents and franchisees. Our sister brand has access to children's information and is jointly responsible for protecting children's privacy, but please direct all communication concerning children's information to Baskin-Robbins (contact information is given below). Our agents may need children's personal information in order to fill an order, respond to a request or help provide Birthday Club support, prevent fraud, or assist us in the management and improvement of our Web site. Our franchisees may need children's personal information in order to help us provide Birthday Club services and prevent fraud. We require our agents and franchisees to respect our privacy practices concerning children's information and not use children's information for purposes other than to carry out our instructions.
					</p><p>Parents may request at any time that we delete information about their children from our databases. If you would like to deactivate your child's Birthday Club account, please visit your account and remove your child from the registration list.

					<p>When you enter your credit card number or personal and financial information, we use a sophisticated software program (Secure Socket Layer Technology or SSL) to encrypt or scramble that information before it's sent so that even if anyone intercepts the information, it is highly unlikely that they will be able to read or use it. In addition, we take appropriate security measures to safeguard your personal information once we have received it.
