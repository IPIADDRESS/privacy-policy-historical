            <h1>Your Privacy is Very Important to Us </h1>
<p>Basement Systems, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. </p>
<p>The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: <a href="http://www.basementsystems.com/">www.basementsystems.com</a>. </p>
<p>When you visit our site, you can expect to be notified of: what personally identifiable information of yours is collected; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; what choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; the kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the licensee's control; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. </p>
<p>The information gathered by the Basement Systems, Inc. on <a href="http://www.basementsystems.com/">www.basementsystems.com</a> falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to our websites through optional registration and (2) tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through our sites. </p>
<p><strong>Email Addresses and Personal Information</strong> <br>E-mail Addresses and personal information: When you fill out any of our Web forms for free inspections or any other inquiries, you generally may have to submit your phone number, address, e-mail address and other personal information. <strong>This information collected from you WILL NOT be distributed or shared with any third parties other than the assigned local Basement Systems or CleanSpace Dealer in your area.</strong> The information you provide us will be kept confidential within&nbsp;Basement Systems&nbsp;database and your local dealer. </p>
<p>To make use of certain features on our websites (such as bulletin boards, coupon pages, and other interactive forums), visitors need to register and to provide certain information as part of the registration process. The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our site to your interests and make them more useful to you. The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. </p>
<p>Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply the information we need, we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to other visitors to our sites. Of course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're still free to take advantage of the wealth of content available on our sites without registration. </p>
<p>To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we may invoke a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of user ID, if you will, that resides on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie can't read data off your hard drive. </p>
<p>Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our sites. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our sites to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our sites. </p>
<p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for other purposes. </p>
<p>Our site may use forms that require users to give us contact information (like their name and email address). We use customer contact information from the forms to send the user information about our company and member services. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. </p>
<p>This site contains links to other sites. Basement Systems Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. </p>
<p>To make our sites more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some features in conjunction with other providers through cooperative arrangements with providers that specialize in operating such services. And, of course, our sites include links to plenty of other websites whose privacy policies we don't control. Once you leave our servers (you can tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information.</p>            <p align="right" style="clear:both;"><a href="javascript:history.go(-1)" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://www.basementsystems.com/images/icons/back-page.png" alt="Back to Previous Page" width="14" height="14" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a> <a href="javascript:history.go(-1)" rel="nofollow">Back to previous page</a>
