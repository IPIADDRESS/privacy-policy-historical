<h3>Verifying your identity where you request access to your information</h3>

<p>Where you request access to your information, we are required by law to use all reasonable measures to verify your identity before doing so. </p>

<p>These measures are designed to protect your information and to reduce the risk of identity fraud, identity theft or general unauthorised access to your information.</p>

<h4>How we verify your identity<em> 
</em></h4>

<p>Where we possess appropriate information about you on file, we will attempt to verify your identity using that information. </p>

<p>If it is not possible to identity you from such information, or if we have insufficient information about you, we may require original or certified copies of certain documentation in order to be able to verify your identity before we are able to provide you with access to your information. </p>

<p>We will be able to confirm the precise information we require to verify your identity in your specific circumstances if and when you make such a request.</p>

<h2>Your right to object to the processing of your information for certain purposes</h2>

<p>You have the following rights in relation to your information, which you may exercise in the same way as you may exercise by writing to Basenotes, BCM Box 1111, London, WC1N 3XX, United Kingdom or sending an email to support@basenotes.net:</p>

<ul>
	<li>to object to us using or processing your information where we use or process it in order to <strong>carry out a task in the public interest</strong> <strong>or for our legitimate interests</strong>, including ‘profiling’ (i.e. analysing or predicting your behaviour based on your information) based on any of these purposes; and</li>
	<li>to object to us using or processing your information for <strong>direct marketing purposes</strong> (including any profiling we engage in that is related to such direct marketing).</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also exercise your right to object to us using or processing your information for direct marketing purposes by:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>clicking the unsubscribe link</strong> contained at the bottom of any marketing email we send to you and following the instructions which appear in your browser following your clicking on that link;</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on how to object to our use of information collected from cookies and similar technologies, please see the section entitled How to accept or reject cookies in our cookies policy, which is <a href="http://www.basenotes.net/about/cookiepolicy">available here</a>.</p>

<h2>Sensitive Personal Information<strong>
</strong></h2>

<p>‘Sensitive personal information’ is information about an individual that reveals their racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic information, biometric information for the purpose of uniquely identifying an individual, information concerning health or information concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.</p>

<p>We do not knowingly or intentionally collect sensitive personal information from individuals, and you must not submit sensitive personal information to us.</p>

<p>If, however, you inadvertently or intentionally transmit sensitive personal information to us, you will be considered to have explicitly consented to us processing that sensitive personal information under Article 9(2)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation. We will use and process your sensitive personal information for the purposes of deleting it.</p>

<h2>Changes to our Privacy Policy<strong>
</strong></h2>

<p>We update and amend our Privacy Policy from time to time.</p>

<h3>Minor changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>Where we make minor changes to our Privacy Policy, we will update our Privacy Policy with a new effective date stated at the beginning of it. Our processing of your information will be governed by the practices set out in that new version of the Privacy Policy from its effective date onwards.</p>

<h3>Major changes to our Privacy Policy or the purposes for which we process your information</h3>

<p>Where we make major changes to our Privacy Policy or intend to use your information for a new purpose or a different purpose than the purposes for which we originally collected it, we will notify you by email (where possible) or by posting a notice on our website. </p>

<p>We will provide you with the information about the change in question and the purpose and any other relevant information before we use your information for that new purpose.</p>

<p>Wherever required, we will obtain your prior consent before using your information for a purpose that is different from the purposes for which we originally collected it.</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying regulations protect the privacy of children using the internet. We do not knowingly contact or collect information from persons under the age of 18. The website is not intended to solicit information of any kind from persons under the age of 18.</p>

<p>It is possible that we could receive information pertaining to persons under the age of 18 by the fraud or deception of a third party. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will, where required by law to do so, immediately obtain the appropriate parental consent to use that information or, if we are unable to obtain such parental consent, we will delete the information from our servers. If you would like to notify us of our receipt of information about persons under the age of 18, please do so by sending an email to support@basenotes.net.</p>
