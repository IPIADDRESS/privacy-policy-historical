      <div align="left"> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><font size="2"> 
          I don't currently use cookies or tracking mechanisms on this site (other 
          than general log files, which are only used to collect information on 
          overall site visitation; also PayPal's secure order server tracks partial 
          orders, but that isn't done on my site, but by PayPal). Thus, if you 
          restrict yourself to visiting pages on this site, you leave minimal 
          information behind that could be used to track you (the general logs 
          contain only IP addresses, which for most of you, would require cooperation 
          of your Internet Service Provider in order to isolate to individual 
          user).</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><font size="2">However, 
          it sure would help me pay for maintaining and updating the site if you'd 
          purchase my books and other highlighted items through the Amazon links 
          that I've provided (I collect a small extra percentage on such sales). 
          Amazon <i>does</i> use tracking mechanisms, so you need to be aware 
          of them. For example, when you click on an Amazon link on the bythom.com 
          site, an "affiliate ID" is passed with you when you are taken 
          to their URLs. If you make a purchase at either site <i><b>during that 
          session</b></i>, the affiliate ID is captured with the transaction (so 
          that the site can figure out where to send a commission check). At present, 
          I earn 2% to 5% on Amazon purchases you make this way. Note that the 
          affiliate tracking isn't permanent: if you log off your Internet connection 
          and later log back on and go to Amazon directly, you aren't tracked 
          as a bythom.com referral.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But even 
          that simple act of passing on an affiliate ID has some interesting consequences. 
          Amazon, in particular, has developed technologies that are quite useful, 
          if applied reasonably. You'll note that there's now an "Amazon 
          Recommends" list on my <a href="/otherbooks.htm">Other Recommended 
          Books</a> page. That list is produced by noting what books were purchased 
          by all those who were referred to Amazon by my site. Likewise, as an 
          Amazon affiliate, I can pull up lists of what was purchased bythom.com 
          referrals (as you might guess, The <i>Nikon Field Guide</i> was one 
          of the better sellers, but at least so far in 2001, it appears that 
          the Magic Lantern N80 book is your number one choice on Amazon). I also 
          get reports of the total amount spend by bythom.com referrals (obviously, 
          otherwise I wouldn't know if the commission checks were accurate), though 
          I have no way of knowing who bought what (nor do I want to know). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><font size="2">Since 
          Amazon collects information about their site visitors, please read their 
          privacy policy when you're on their site if you're concerned about how 
          your surfing might be tracked (see also the links I've provided, below). 
          </font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><font size="2">This 
          site also invites you to sign up for my email newsletter on bCentral. 
          If you do, Listbot tracks your email address for me, and you'll receive 
          an email from me from time to time. bCentral is part of Microsoft's 
          services, and does track information on you. While I can get to the 
          basic information about individual email subscribers, to date I have 
          never bothered to look. </font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of 
          you send me direct email and comments on articles. For legal purposes, 
          I archive all such mail, thus I do maintain a record of what you've 
          sent me. Again, however, it is not my practice to do anything with such 
          information. I don't, for example, add you to the bCentral email server 
          if you send me private email. I don't build email address lists and 
          sell them to others. If a response is warranted, I respond to your email 
          and archive the original. If you've submitted a comment on an article, 
          I edit it and place it on the site if I think it adds useful information 
          or commentry, then archive your original submission (sometimes I'll 
          respond directly if the comment contained a question). In short, I'll 
          respond when you ask for response, otherwise I'll simply archive what 
          you've sent me so that my records regarding this site are complete.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, 
          when you order one of my books through PayPal, you should be aware that 
          PayPal most definitely tracks information about you, both while you're 
          on there secure Web order server, and after you've joined PayPal as 
          a member. PayPal's privacy information is somewhat complicated, so I 
          simply invite you to look at their site for more information (see link, 
          below). </font></p>
