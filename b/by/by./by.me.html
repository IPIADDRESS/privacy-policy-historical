<p><strong><br>
5. COOKIES </strong></p>
<p>Cookies are text files stored and used to record non-personal and personal information concerning Your browsing of the Site.</p>
<p>3DVIA may use cookies or other technologies that may collect or store Personal Data to improve services for You through, for example:<br>
• enabling a service to recognize your device so You don’t have to give the same information several times during one task,<br>
• recognizing that You may already have given a username and password so you don’t need to do it for every web page requested,<br>
• measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there’s enough capacity to ensure they are fast,<br>
• analyzing data to help 3DVIA understand how people interact with the Services so 3DVIA can enhance the Services or optimize Your user experience and content to better reflect Your needs and interests.</p>
<p>3DVIA uses two types of cookies: permanent cookies and temporary cookies. Temporary cookies disappear as soon as You log off from the Site. Permanent cookies remain after logging off from the Site in order to be used on subsequent visits to the Site.</p>
<p>You will be notified the first time You receive a cookie, and then You decide whether to accept it or refuse it. By continuing to use the Site in consideration of the above, You expressly authorize 3DVIA to use such cookies.</p>
<p>You can also configure Your browser software to refuse all cookies; if You do so, however, some areas and features of the Site may not function properly and/or You may not access some parts or services of the Site.</p>
<p>When you navigate through the Site, some information may also be collected through the use of other technologies, such as Internet tags or web beacons, and/or the collection of navigational data (log files, server logs, clickstream data).</p>
<p>Your Internet browser will then automatically send 3DVIA such information, such as the URL of the website that you just came from, the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer is currently using, your clickstream on the website (pages that you have visited, paths taken on the site etc.).</p>
<p>3DVIA may use your information collected through the Site in order to manage your account, improve the content of our website and our service, communicate information to you (if you have requested such information), for our research and marketing needs, for statistical purposes and/or to identify the products and services that the users are interested in.</p>
<p>3DVIA may also use third party vendors to measure and analyze the effectiveness of the Site and the Services (third parties such as Google that are specialized in web analytics, to measure the traffic) or to analyze Your use of the Site and Services in order to optimize Your user experience and content to better reflect Your needs and interests; in such a case, web beacons and cookies provided by such third party vendors may be used and stored.</p>
<p><strong><br>
6. PERSONAL DATA PROCESSING AND STORAGE TERM</strong></p>
<p>Processing of Personal Data includes using, storing, recording, transferring, adapting, summarizing, amending, reporting, sharing and destroying Personal Data as necessary under the circumstances or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>All Personal Data that will have been collected will be stored for a limited duration that is relevant to the purpose of such collection and for so long as required by applicable law.</p>
<p><strong><br>
7. LINKS TO WEBSITES NOT CONTROLLED BY 3DVIA OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES</strong></p>
<p>This Site and the Services might offer links to third party Websites which may be of interest to You.</p>
<p>Unless 3DVIA receives Your express authorization, 3DVIA does not share any Personal Data with these third parties. However, 3DVIA may provide them with Non-Personal Data.</p>
<p>These third parties use technological processes to send advertisements and links appearing on the Site to Your browser software, via Your IP address. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript or web beacons) to assess the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their content.</p>
<p>3DVIA does not exercise any control over the content of third party Websites or the practices of these third parties in connection with the protection of Personal Data that they might collect and are thus not in the control of 3DVIA. Consequently, 3DVIA declines all liability for the content of third party websites or the practices of these third parties concerning the protection of Personal Data.</p>
<p>It is therefore Your responsibility to inform yourself as to these third parties’ privacy policies.</p>
<p><strong><br>
8. TRANSFER/SHARING OF PERSONAL DATA </strong></p>
<p>If You are accessing the Site and Services from a location outside of the European Union, with laws or regulations governing data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from European Union, please note that through Your continued use of the Site and Services, which are governed by French law, the corresponding Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, You are transferring Your Personal Data to the European Union and You consent to that transfer.</p>
<p>As a company belonging to a global group, 3DVIA is able to use available technology to efficiently manage Personal Data and obtain such Personal Data online or otherwise throughout its international operations. Personal Data may be collected through the Site and Services and subsequently disclosed to and used by an affiliate of 3DVIA (“3DVIA Group Companies”) for the purposes stated in Article 4 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Please note that 3DVIA may transfer Your Personal Data outside of the European Union, as long as before transferring Your Personal Data, 3DVIA has ascertained that non European Union entities offer an adequate level of protection in accordance with European legislation.</p>
<p>Where 3DVIA has knowledge that a third party to which 3DVIA has provided Personal Data for the purposes listed in Article 4 above, is using or disclosing Personal Data contrary to this Privacy Policy or to applicable laws, 3DVIA will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such use or disclosure.</p>
<p>You will have the opportunity to decide whether You authorize 3DVIA to use Your Personal Data for a purpose differing from the purpose for which it was originally collected.</p>
<p>3DVIA will also disclose Personal Data to third parties if 3DVIA determines that such disclosure is necessary for technical reasons (such as hosting services by a third party) or to protect 3DVIA’s legal interests (such as in the event of acquisition or merger by a third company or total or partial liquidation of 3DVIA). These transfers may be transmitted over the internet, via mail, via facsimile, or by any other method which 3DVIA determines is appropriate and in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p>3DVIA may also disclose Your Personal Data to carefully selected partners who offer products and services that may be of interest to You, provided that You have expressly agreed to receive such offers. In such a case, 3DVIA requires its partners to process Your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and use it for the same purposes. You can at any time object to the use of Your Personal Data for such purposes, without any charge or justification, by clicking on the link that will be provided to You at the bottom of each email that You receive.<br>
<strong>9. RIGHT OF ACCESS TO AND RECTIFICATION OF THE DATA</strong></p>
<p>3DVIA will take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data collected is used for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy and that such Personal Data is correct and up to date.</p>
<p>You have a right to access Your Personal Data. In addition, You have a right to request the rectification, completion, update or erasure of Your Personal Data. You also have a right to obtain a copy of the Personal Data conserved by 3DVIA.</p>
<p>If You have an account, You can exercise Your rights of access to and rectification of the Personal Data by logging on to Your account. Otherwise, You may exercise Your rights of access to and rectification of the data by sending an email to the following address: mkt@homebyme.com.</p>
<p>Depending on the scope of the request, 3DVIA reserves the right to charge a reasonable fee to cover any out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such access, modification and deletion of Personal Data. 3DVIA may deny access to Personal Data in limited circumstances, defined by applicable laws and regulations.<br>
<strong>10. DATA SECURITY AND RECIPIENTS</strong></p>
<p>3DVIA undertakes to ensure the protection and security of Personal Data that You choose to communicate, in order to ensure the confidentiality of Your Personal Data and prevent Your Personal Data from being distorted, damaged, destroyed or disclosed to unauthorized parties.</p>
<p>3DVIA maintains reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alternation and destruction. As part of those safeguards, 3DVIA employs sophisticated technology designed to protect Personal Data during its transmission and prevent transmission errors or unauthorized acts of third parties. However, while 3DVIA strives to protect Your Personal Data, in light of the inevitable risks of data transmission over the internet, 3DVIA cannot guarantee full protection against any error occurring during the course of Personal Data transmission which is beyond 3DVIA ‘s reasonable control.</p>
<p>Since all Personal Data is confidential, access is limited to employees, contractors and agents of 3DVIA or 3DVIA Group Companies who have a need to know such data in carrying out their tasks. All the people who have access to Your Personal Data are bound by a duty of confidentiality and subject to disciplinary actions and/or other sanctions if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
<p>However, it is important for You to exercise caution to prevent unauthorized access to Your Personal Data. You are responsible for the confidentiality of Your password and information appearing on Your account. Consequently, You must ensure that You log out of Your session in the event of shared use of a computer.</p>
<p><strong>11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION </strong></p>
<p>Although 3DVIA has put in place reasonable safeguards to protect Personal Data, we recognize that there is no method of transmitting or storing Personal Data that is completely secure.</p>
<p>However, 3DVIA is committed to ensure the privacy of Personal Data: if You have a reason to believe that the security of Your Personal Data has been compromised or misused, You should contact 3DVIA via the following address: mkt@homebyme.com.</p>
<p>3DVIA will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints regarding use and disclosure of Personal Data in accordance with the principles contained in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Unauthorized access to Personal Data or the improper use of Personal Data may constitute offences under local law and under the regulations in force within each company in the 3DVIA group.<br>
