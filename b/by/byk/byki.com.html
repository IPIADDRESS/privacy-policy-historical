<h1>Privacy Policy</h1><br>
<h6>Your Guarantee of Privacy</h6>
<p>Here at Byki.com we want you to enjoy our content and enjoy interacting with others through Byki.com. We will never sell or otherwise give your information to anyone and we will always do our best to treat your privacy with care and respect.</p>
<h6>Subscriptions, Registrations, and Other Requests for Information</h6>
<p>There are areas on the site that will ask you for your email address to register for a service. We do this to register your request and maintain the capability to communicate with you regarding that service. Registrants may unsubscribe from subscriptions or services by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email they receive. In some instances, service registrations are accompanied by check boxes that indicate your desire to receive information on special content and product offers. For those people who choose to receive such offers, they may unsubscribe from receiving such offers at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link within the email offer itself.</p>
<h6>Sharing Lists Through Byki.com—You and Your Friends Are Safe</h6>
<p>Byki.com provides an easy way to share <strong>Byki</strong> lists with your friends. We only use your friends' email addresses to deliver links for the lists you want to share. Likewise, when you share a list with others, we only use your email address to communicate regarding the list you have shared. We will not send you or your friends spam and you will not hear from us again, unless you subscribe to one of our services or request to receive our offers.</p>
<h6>Sharing Run Amok…</h6>
<p>We recognize that there are some people that might abuse our list sharing system to send email to someone who is NOT a friend and did not want to receive a list or email from them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is a hazard of offering people an easy way to share lists and will occasionally lead to some people getting something they didn't want. If you are one of these people, and you received something you didn't want to get from a "friend", we apologize profusely.</p>
<p><strong><br>Our parent company's privacy policy:</strong></p>
<h1>Transparent Language Inc. Privacy Statement</h1>
<p>At Transparent Language, Inc. (“TL”), we take your privacy seriously. We developed this privacy policy to explain our information collection and use practices. We respect the confidentiality of personal information that identifies you and treat that information responsibly. As described below, we do not authorize the selling or renting of your personal information to third parties for their business purposes.</p>
<p>By using our web site, you accept the practices that are described in this Privacy Statement, which is effective as of September 1, 2009, and is part of the <a href="terms.html">Web Site General Terms and Conditions</a> governing use of this site. We may change or add to this statement from time to time. When that happens, we will post the revised statement here. Your use of our site after changes to this Privacy Statement have been made constitutes acceptance of those changes going forward.</p>
<p>TL is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of the websites from which you access our site, sites to which we link, or any sites that are linked to our site.</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement tells you the types of customer information we collect, how we use that information and with whom we may share it, and how you can access or change information about you (such as your email address). If you have questions about TL’s privacy policy or practices, or if you would like more information, please <a href="mailto:info@transparent.com">contact us</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1. What personal information do we collect about our customers?</strong></p>
<p>We collect the personal information that our customers tell us when they contact us via the internet, or use our site, or purchase merchandise from us. When you request information from TL, we may ask you to provide your name, address, telephone number, and email address. If you purchase a product, we will ask you for financial information, such as a credit card number, and a shipping address and your billing address.</p>
<p>From time to time we may offer a contest and you may complete an entry form. We may collect additional information about you, including your social security number.</p>
<p><strong>2. What other kinds of customer information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>Our system may also identify which browser and Internet Provider you use to access our site. In addition, to help us understand the use of our site by our visitors and improve your browsing and shopping experiences, we automatically collect information as to how you were directed to the site, how you navigate around it, what products you browse, as well as your purchasing activities.</p>
<p><strong>3. How do we collect this information?</strong>
<br><br>When you register with TL, we compile the personal information you give us about yourself into an individual profile. We add other personal information about you to that profile as you give it to us. We also collect information about your purchases and other uses of our site as they are made. We gather other information through the use of “cookies”.</p>
<p><strong>4. What are “cookies” and how do we use them? What are “web beacons”?</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are small text files that allow a website to store on a computer an identification code associated with you which can later be retrieved and associated with your visit to the site. There are two types. Session cookies terminate shortly after you close your Internet browser. Persistent cookies are stored on your hard drive until they expire or are deleted. Both types of cookies enhance our ability to serve you by recalling information about you such as your password, shopping preferences and shopping cart information.</p>
<p>We understand that not everyone wants to permit the use of cookies. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies and how to disable cookies</p>
<p>We may also use “web beacons” or “pixel tags” in conjunction with cookies. A web beacon is typically a small transparent graphic that is placed on a web site or email. We track how visitors arrive at our site and your browsing activities at our web site. We use this information to compile sales and statistical data.</p>
<p>We use cookies on our site to use for advertising purposes. If you do not wish to have your computer cookied, you may Opt‐Out of this advertising service by <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Must a visitor provide personal information to use the site?</strong></p>
<p>Personal information is not required to access the site or navigate from web page to web page. However, you will be asked to provide personal information if you request assistance, a catalog or want to make a purchase. Personal information is also required to request information or assistance from us or to take advantage of certain optional features of our site such as a contest.</p>
<p><strong>6. What if a visitor does not want to provide information over the internet?</strong></p>
<p>You may contact TL by telephone at 1-603-262-6300. In the United States and Canada, contact us toll free at 1-800-567-9619. You may also reach our web store by calling us at 1-888-245-1829. We respect the confidentiality of your personal information as described in this Privacy Statement whether you provide it over the internet or by telephone.</p>
<p><strong>7. How do we protect personal information?</strong></p>
<p>All of your personal information is encrypted by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software when it is transmitted to us via the web. We maintain the servers that store this information in a locked facility with restricted access. We also truncate your credit card number to the last four digits when we communicate with you about your order.</p>
<p><strong>8. How do we use information about our customers?</strong></p>
<p>We will use your contact information to respond to requests for information or a catalogue. We may send you e-newsletters or other promotional notices.</p>
<p>We use your personal information to process your orders. This includes contacting you to confirm your order, filling the order and shipping it to you. We may also contact you if we want to communicate with you about your order.</p>
<p>If you choose to participate in a contest or sweepstakes, we will use your personal information to administer and manage those features.</p>
<p>We may also use your personal information to improve our service to you and for other business purposes. For example, we periodically review customer information as part of servicing our accounts. We may also contact you from time to time to inform you of the services that we offer and to gather information about how we can improve them.</p>
<p>Finally, we analyze information we obtain from cookies and web beacons concerning our customers’ access and navigation of our site and their browsing and purchasing activities to improve our services and enhance our customers’ shopping experiences.</p>
<p><strong>9. How do we share customers’ personal information with third parties?</strong></p>
<p>In order to process your orders and requests, we make your name, address, and sometimes your e-mail address or telephone number available to other entities such as credit card companies and package delivery services (for example, American Express, Visa, MasterCard, UPS, and United States Postal Service).</p>
<p>We may use third party agents, consultants and contractors to perform business functions on our behalf, including customer service, account servicing, customer research, marketing, provision of IT services and records maintenance. We give these entities access to our customers’ personal information to perform these functions for us and do not authorize them to use that information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>Additionally, we share personal information about you when you voluntarily use certain optional features of our site. If you participate in a contest or sweepstakes, we may share the information you submit with others assisting us in the administration of that feature.</p>
<p>It is possible that TL or part of its business or one of its affiliates could merge with, acquire or be acquired by another business entity and your personal information could be among the assets transferred. If this occurs, you will be notified of the change by e-mail or notice on this site.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to share personal information about you with our affiliates in the course of our business operations. We also reserve the right to share personal information about you as required by law or in cooperation with legal authorities and to enforce the Web Site General Terms and Conditions governing use of this site or to protect the rights, property, or safety of TL and its customers. We reserve the right to use non-confidential information in any manner we feel appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>10. How do we share other customer information with third parties?</strong></p>
<p>We may share non-personal non-individually identifiable information about our customers with the group of people with whom we share personal information, as well as with other third parties such as vendors, advertisers and marketing firms.</p>
<p><strong>11. How can visitors to our web site check or change information we collect about them?</strong></p>
<p>You can opt out of TL’s use of cookies to recall information about you by setting your browser not to accept cookies or to disable cookies.</p>
<p>You may send us updated information via email. You can also change personal information such as your shipping address or payment method when ordering. You can subscribe to or unsubscribe from E-newsletters and other promotional notices by <a href="mailto:info@transparent.com">sending us an email</a> with your instructions.</p>
<p>Our Customer Service Representatives are also ready to assist you in checking or changing your personal profile or removing your name from our contact lists. To do so, you may contact TL by telephone at 1-603-262-6300. In the United States and Canada, contact us toll free at 1-800-567-9619.</p>
<p>You may also send us instructions by Postal Service to:</p>
