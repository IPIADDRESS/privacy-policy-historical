<p class="style1" align="left"><strong>2.&nbsp; Web Site Usage Information</strong> </p>
<p class="style1" align="left"><strong>(i) Cookies</strong> <br>We may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you.&nbsp; Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a Web server when you visit it and are stored on your computer's hard drive for record keeping purposes.&nbsp; Cookies track where you travel on our Web Site and what you look at and purchase. &nbsp;They may store the information in your shopping cart, and/or your username and password.&nbsp; A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Web Site to other information about you, including your Personal Information.&nbsp; These purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Web Site.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1" align="left">You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the internet industry.&nbsp; We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our privacy policies.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1" align="left">Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.&nbsp; Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Web Site or certain areas or features of the Web Site.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1" align="left"><strong>(ii) Clear GIFs&nbsp; </strong><br>We may use “clear GIFs” (aka “Web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies, in the Web Site and in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a web page or received a message.&nbsp; A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message.&nbsp; A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.</p>
<p class="style1" align="left"><strong>(iii) IP Address and Clickstream Data</strong><br>Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or Web Site registrations, is collected through various methods.&nbsp; For example, our server may automatically collect data about your server’s internet address when you visit us.&nbsp; This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your internet service provider whenever you’re on the internet.&nbsp; When you request pages from our Web Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name.&nbsp; Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Web Site; the web site you visit after this Web Site; the ads you see; the ads you click on; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Web Site or a referral site; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers.&nbsp; We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web Site.&nbsp; Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and internet service provider.&nbsp; We may also link this information with your Personal Information when we feel that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules and policies or Terms of Use or to protect our Web Site, customers or others.</p>
<p class="style1" align="left">Any or all of these activities with regard to Web Site usage information may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.</p>
<p class="style1" align="left"><strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; How is the Personal Information Used?</strong> <br>We use both personal and aggregated information we collect for multiple purposes.&nbsp; The Personal Information may be used to improve the content of the Web Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Web Site for each individual user, and to notify users about updates to the Web Site or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you.&nbsp; We will use the Personal Information you provide to our Web Site, for example, to respond to your requests and to provide you with our product and service offerings.&nbsp; For example, we will process your orders, respond to your requests and inquiries and provide you with the services and features offered on or through our Web Site.&nbsp; We may also use your Personal Information to maintain our internal record keeping.&nbsp; We may also report information about your account to credit bureaus.&nbsp; Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.&nbsp; We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Web Site usage information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources, including third parties.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>In addition, we may send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the like), and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>You may opt-out of receiving such notices from us, at any time, by following the instructions that will be contained in such notices.</p>

<h1 class="style1" align="left">2.&nbsp; Phishing</h1>
<p class="style1" align="left">With identity theft a continuing problem, it has become increasingly common for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line merchant, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information.&nbsp; Sometimes, the domain name of the e-mail address from which the e-mail appears to have been sent, and the domain name of the web site requesting such information, appears to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted company.&nbsp; In reality, such sensitive information may be collected by an unauthorized individual to be used for purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity has come to be known as "phishing." </p>
