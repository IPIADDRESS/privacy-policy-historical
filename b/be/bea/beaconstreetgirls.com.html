              <p>B*tween Productions, Inc. is committed to protecting your online privacy and the safety of all of our website users.&nbsp; Our website, located at <a href="http://www.beaconstreetgirls.com/">www.<em>beaconstreetgirls.com</em></a>, is the place in cyberspace where fans of our <em>Beacon Street Girls</em> can come to find out more about their favorite Beacon Street Girls, play games and have their opinions heard. At <em>beaconstreetgirls.com</em>, we believe in the power of children and we urge both children and their parents to use and enjoy our website.&nbsp; While we encourage the interactive nature of online media, we hope to educate children and parents on safeguarding your privacy when using the Internet.&nbsp; As such, we want you to check with your parents before entering information on this or any other website.&nbsp; Our information collection practices are described below. Use of our website is subject to the <a href="BeaconStreetGirlsWebSiteTermsandConditions.doc"><em>Beacon Street Girls Web Site Terms and Conditions</em></a>. </p>
              <p><span class="boldblack">A SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS:</span> We are committed to fully complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.&nbsp; Parents, you can help by spending time online with your children and monitoring your children's online use. Please help us protect your child's privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this website or any other without your permission.</p>
              <p>IF YOU ARE UNDER 18, PLEASE BE SURE TO READ THIS POLICY WITH YOUR PARENTS AND ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

              <p><span class="boldblack"><span class="style12"><a name="information" id="information"></a></span>What Information Is Collected?<br>
                    <br>
              </span>It's our policy to create website content that
 requires minimum collection of information from our visitors. Generally, we limit our collection of information from children to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (e.g. screen name, birthday, gender). This information is collected so children can participate in activities (e.g. post messages, play online games) without giving unnecessary personal information. From time to time, however, we may request limited personally identifiable information (e.g. child's email address and/or email address of parent or third party), as explained below, in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes or offer other online activities (e.g. electronic postcards, videos, newsletters). We do not condition a child's participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. </p>
              <p><strong><span class="style12"><a name="useinfo" id="useinfo"></a></span>Use of Information</strong><br>
                  <br>
                  At <em>beaconstreetgirls.com</em> we use or may use personally identifiable information that children provide for such purposes as sending requested electronic postcards, email messages and videos on their behalf, and conducting contests or sweepstakes, and responding to their questions regarding our products and services. We currently do not disclose to third parties personally identifiable information that children provide, except from time to time, we may transfer, disclose or share such information with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle and deliver certain online activities (e.g. conducting contests and sweepstakes). Such third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Additionally, in the event that all or substantially all of our assets are acquired by another entity, personally identifiable information submitted to us may be transferred to the acquiring entity. Finally, we may also disclose personally identifiable information to third parties in order to comply with law or requests by law enforcement agencies, to enforce our <a href="BeaconStreetGirlsWebSiteTermsandConditions.doc"><em>Web Site Terms and Conditions</em></a> and protect the rights, property or safety of our website, users of our website and others. </p>
              <p><strong><span class="style12"><a name="enewssub" id="enewssub"></a></span>Electronic Newsletter Subscription</strong></p>
              <p>We offer children the opportunity to sign up to receive the Beacon Street Girls newsletter by email. When a child asks to receive our email newsletter, the child is asked to provide his or her first name, email address and the email address of his or her parent. Within two business days of receiving this information, we send the child's parent a notification email informing the parent of the child's request to receive by email the Beacon Street Girls newsletter on an ongoing basis and give the parent the option to have his or her child's information be removed from our Beacon Street Girls newsletter database. At any time after receiving this notification email, the child's parent has the opportunity to exercise the option to request that we stop sending the child the Beacon Street Girls newsletter and have the child's information removed from our Beacon Street Girls newsletter by following the "unsubscribe" instructions found in either their initial notification email or at the end of any of the Beacon Street Girls newsletter emails. In addition, parents may at any time review any identifiable information collected about their child (see <strong>Parental Access</strong> below). </p>
              <p>Information collected for the Beacon Street Girls newsletters is used only to send the child the electronic newsletter and may be transferred, disclosed, or shared with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle the preparation and delivery of the electronic newsletter and perform other related technical and processing functions. These third parties may not use it for other purposes and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information.</p>
              <p><strong><span class="style12"><a name="contests" id="contests"></a></span>Contests and Sweepstakes</strong></p>
              <p>Occasionally we may offer contests and sweepstakes which may be entered online. To participate in a contest or sweepstakes, a child is asked to provide his or her first name and email address. Sometimes, when we conduct contests or sweepstakes that may involve more than a one-time contact, we ask additionally for the email address of his or her parent. In such types of contests or sweepstakes, we send the child's parent an email within two business days informing him or her of the child's entry and give the parent the option to have the child's entry deleted. All the information we collect is securely maintained and used only for the purpose of conducting the contest or sweepstakes. Once the contest or sweepstakes is finished, we then delete any personal information collected.&nbsp; Information collected in a contest or sweepstakes may be passed to a fulfillment house which may use the information to help run the contest or sweepstakes and may not use it for other purposes and has agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information. </p>
              <p><strong><span class="style12"><a name="epostcards" id="epostcards"></a></span>Electronic Postcards, Videos Email Messages</strong></p>
              <p>We provide children the opportunity to send electronic postcards or videos featuring Beacon Street Girls characters or original artwork and videos to family or friends. We may also feature information about products that children are interested in and from time to time may send, on behalf of children who request it, email messages to family and/or friends to let family and/or friends share their interest. We may ask for a first name, but we do not require children to submit personally identifiable information about themselves in order to send an electronic postcard or for <em>beaconstreetgirls.com</em> to send email messages to family or friends. We do, however, ask children to submit the email address of the recipient of such electronic postcards or email messages. We may also provide the opportunity to send e-mail to the Beacon Street Girls through our website. We may ask for first names, but we request no personally identifiable information except an e-mail address, which we use solely for the purpose of responding to messages and/or requests.</p>
              <p>All information collected for electronic postcards, video and email messages is used only to send the requested electronic postcard, video or email message and to respond to email questions and/or requests and is deleted from our system once the electronic postcard, video, email message or email response is sent. </p>
              <p><strong><span class="style12"><a name="shop" id="shop"></a></span>Information Received from the Beacon Street Girls Shop</strong></p>
              <p>The website for the <a href="BSG_ecom/store.jsp">Beacon Street Girls Shop</a>,(the “Shop”) which is hosted and operated by a third party and is independent and separate from <em>beaconstreetgirls.com</em>, collects personal information about its users and shares and transfers such information with us. We use the personal information we receive internally within B*tween Productions, Inc. but we do not sell, transfer or share the information with third parties except from time to time, we may transfer, disclose or share such information with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle and manage certain functions (e.g. fulfilling contests and sweepstakes conducted on the Shop to which we are sponsors). Such third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of any information they receive from us. Additionally, in the event t
hat all or substantially all of the assets relating to <em>beaconstreetgirls.com</em> are transferred or sold to another entity, personal information we received from the Shop may be transferred to the acquiring entity. Finally, we may also disclose personal information about Shop users to third parties in order to comply with law or requests by law enforcement agencies, to enforce the Shop's Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property or safety of the Shop's users and others.</p>
