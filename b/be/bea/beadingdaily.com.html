minimum required information to complete the shipping of your items.
Except as otherwise indicated in this Privacy Statement, we do not
share this Information with third parties. Please be aware that some
products are made available by third parties on third party web sites,
in which case the section below concerning third party links and web
sites will apply. <br> <br> <b>Navigation Information/Cookies<br> </b>When
visiting our Site(s), your browser sends information to our hosting
server identifying the browser you are using, your Internet Service
Provider, the page you last visited, and the page you are currently
visiting. IWP logs this Information and uses it to help diagnose
problems with our server, to track user traffic patterns, and to
generally administer the Site(s). We may also track and catalog the
search terms that users enter in search forms, but this tracking is not
associated with individual users, except as otherwise indicated in this
Privacy Statement.<br> <br> We make use of a standard feature of
browser software called a “cookie” which helps us recognize you when
you visit. We store your email address in a cookie file and place the
file on the hard drive of your computer. This lets us identify your
computer as a unique user.<br> <br> Most browsers are initially set up
to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or
to indicate when a cookie is being sent. If you disable cookies,
however, you may find the Site(s), and many other web sites, harder to
use. Cookies allow us to streamline your password entry process and
customize your Site homepage, and to generally administer the Site(s).
Our cookies cannot read other data off your hard-drive. <br> <br> <b>Access to Information<br> </b>IWP
and its employees have access to your Information. We use your
Information for the purposes described above. Accordingly, IWP has
established policies with respect to its employees designed to keep
your Information confidential in accordance with the provisions
contained in this Privacy Statement. In addition, to the extent we
disclose or otherwise share your Information with third parties as
described in this Privacy Statement, we require that these third
parties abide by privacy protections similar to those contained in this
Privacy Statement.<br> <br> In addition, we engage third-party
technical service providers and consultants to work on the Site(s). For
example, they may host our Site, provide customer support, repair our
software, or consult on security issues. We allow them access to
Information, but only to the extent required by their role. In such
instances, we require that these third parties abide by privacy
protections similar to those contained in this Privacy Statement. <br> <br> <b>Information Sharing and Disclosure<br> </b>Other
than as specifically described in this Privacy Statement, we only share
aggregated Information about our users. For example, we might share
Information about the number of people who visit our Site(s) or their
demographic information. In addition, we may share aggregated
Information with market analysts, advertisers, business partners,
sponsors, and any other third parties.<br> <br> Except as we have noted
herein, we will not share any personally identifiable Information with
any third party without your express consent, unless we have a good
faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary: (a) to comply
with the law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to enforce this
Privacy Statement or other Site rules and policies; (d) to respond to
claims that you are engaged in activities that violate the rights of
third parties; or (e) to protect the rights or interests of IWP and its
service providers, provided that nothing in this paragraph shall impose
a duty on IWP to make any such disclosures. <br> <br> <b>Transfer of Your Information<br> </b>In
the event of a merger, acquisition, consolidation, or sale of all or
substantially all the assets of IWP, or in the unlikely event of a
bankruptcy, we reserve the right to transfer all or part of our
business, including this Site(s) and your Information, to third
parties. <br> <br> <b>3rd Parties/Links<br> </b>This Privacy
Statement applies only to the Site(s). This Site may include links to
the web sites of both our affiliated and non-affiliated entities (Other
Sites), including access to content, products and services of such
affiliated and non-affiliated entities. Whenever you choose to access
Other Sites or non-IWP content via our Site(s), a separate browser
window will launch and you will leave a certain IWP Site. We urge you
to familiarize yourself with the individual privacy and other terms for
each linked site prior to submitting your Information. <br> <br> <b>Classified Advertisements<br> </b>This
Site contains classified advertisements. These advertisements are one
more way that we help you find the products and services you need.
Please remember, however, that when you respond to a classified
advertisement by email you are sending information to a third party and
not to IWP. We cannot control the use or security of or otherwise be
responsible for any information that your send to a third party, so
please be careful. <br> <br> <b>Supplementing Your Information<br> </b>We
may supplement the Information that you provide with information we
receive from third parties, for example product manufacturers or
service providers. If you have any questions about the privacy policies
of other companies or associations, we encourage you to contact them
directly. If you believe you did not opt in or have opted-out of
certain services and communications from IWP, and you continue to hear
from us (except with respect to our contacting you for reasons
necessary for the operation of the Site(s), which we may continue to
do), please contact us immediately and we will help you update your
preferences and choices in our database. <br> <br> <b>Blogs</b><br>
The Site contains bulletin boards which are available to the public.
Please remember that any text that you send to a bulletin board is
immediately available to the general public. You should exercise
caution when deciding to disclose any sensitive Information like your
name, address, phone number or social security number. <br> <br> <b>Other Important Safety Information<br> </b>You
are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all passwords
issued to you, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur
under your passwords, whether or not expressly authorized by you.
Please notify IWP immediately upon becoming aware of any actual or
suspected abuse or unauthorized use of the passwords issued to you.<br> <br>
We urge you to use only a screen name and/or e-mail address when
chatting or sending e-mail. You may wish to delete unknown e-mail
attachments before opening them. They can contain destructive viruses.
Remember that nothing you write on the Web is completely private -
including e-mail. So be careful and think about what you type and whom
you tell. Not everyone is as trustworthy and honorable as they may
seem. <br> <br> <b>Security<br> </b>Although we have taken
reasonable security precautions, no security system is impenetrable. We
cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee
that Information you supply will not be intercepted while being
transmitted to us over the Internet. <br> <br> <b>Opting In; Reviewing, Correcting or Deleting Information<br> </b>When
you provide contact Information to us, you will be given the ability to
“opt in” to (1) receiving communications from us and our third party
vendors (except for communications necessary for the operation of the
Site(s), which do not require an opt in), (2) having your contact
Information disclosed to third parties (except as necessary for us to
operate the Site(s), or as otherwise permitted under this Privacy
Statement or required under applicable law, which, in each case, will
not require an opt in). If you do not wish to receive such
communications or allow such disclosures, do not opt in. You may view,
correct and revise your Information by accessing your account. For
example, if you have previously opted in and you would like to stop
receiving communications from us and our third party vendors, or you
would like to revoke any other consent previously granted for a
specific purpose concerning your personally identifiable Information,
then you can opt out by sending IWP an e-mail at remove@interweave.com
or calling us at 800-272-2193. In the event you opt-out we may retain
your email address and share your email address with our third party
marketing partners, for the purpose of honoring your request to opt-out
of receiving information from us or our marketing partners on our
behalf. <br> <br> <b>Notice of Changes to the Privacy Statement<br> </b>We
may update this Privacy Statement from time to time. We will notify you
about significant changes in the way we treat personally identifiable
Information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified
in your account or by placing a prominent notice on our Site(s). After
the changes take effect, all newly collected and previously collected
Information will be subject to the terms of the revised Privacy
Statement. <br> <br> <b>Contacting Aspire Media/Interweave Press, LLC<br> </b>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Statement, you may contact us at: privacy@interweave.com</p>
