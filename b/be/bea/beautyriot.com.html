                  <p>We may request at times that you voluntarily supply us with personal information. Such personal information includes any information that may be used to identify a specific individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number(s) and other contact information.  Generally some or all of this information is requested when you register on the Site or when you provide information in connection with sweepstakes, contests, surveys and samples programs. We may request information about your interests and activities, your gender and age, and other demographic information. Some of the information BeautyRiot collects is not explicitly submitted by you – BeautyRiot also automatically receives and records information on its server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, the web pages you request, your browser type and language, access times, the searches you undertake, and the referring web site address.  For instance, when you visit our Site, we may assign your computer one or more cookies, to facilitate access to our Site and to personalize your online experience. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on our Site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on the Site. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies, and you should be able to remove existing cookies by following your browser help file directions. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features offered on our Site. </p>
                  
                  <p>We also may use standard other technologies, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of our Site. We also may include web beacons in promotional or other e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer our Site users to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities.</p>
                  
                  <p>WWe use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements when you visit our Site. The third-party advertising technology that we use on this Site uses information derived from your visits to this Site to target advertising within this Site and gauge the effectiveness of the advertising. </p>
                  
                  <p><strong>The Information Collected by Third Parties Using Technology </strong></p>
                  
                  <p>BeautyRiot, its service providers, or third party advertisers or their service providers may use third-party advertising technology to customize the ads you see on our Site based on your previous online activity on this Site and other sites. This is sometimes called “interest based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising,” and it is intended to deliver ads that are relevant to your interests and thereby enhance your online experience. For instance, certain advertisers may place unique cookies or other electronic tools on your browser that gather non-personally identifiable information regarding your online activities on this Site and others.  This information may then be used, alone or in conjunction with other information, to make inferences about your interests, and then display to you advertisements that are tailored to your particular interests while you are on this Site or other web sites. The collection and use of your information by our service providers, third-party advertisers or their service providers is not covered by this Privacy Policy nor is it within our control.

                  <p><strong>Personal information</strong></p> 
                  <p>We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give you the opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared (see below “Controlling Your Personal Information”).  </p> 
                  
                  <p>We may share your personal information in connection with sharing, selling or licensing your article comments to third parties. Your first name and last initial and any personally identifiable information you have included in your article comments may be transferred to such third parties and displayed on their web sites in connection with such third parties' publication of your article comments. </p> 
                  
                  <p>Total Beauty may share your information with third party businesses for their online marketing purposes; but we do not disclose your personal information to any such third parties that may want to offer you their own products and services unless you have requested or authorized us to do so.</p> 
                  
                  <p>We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include supporting our Site functionality and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our Site. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes. </p> 
                  
                  <p>We may disclose your personal information to strategic partners with which we undertake traffic linking arrangements or co-branded promotions.</p>
                  
                  <p>We may disclose your personal information in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. </p> 
                  
                  <p>We may disclose your personal information when we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our Site's terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.</p> 
                  
                  <p>We may disclose your information to subsidiaries and affiliates of Total Beauty.</p>
                  
                  <p>We may disclose your personal information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. The personal information which you provide to us is an asset of BeautyRiot and Total Beauty and may be included in the assets transferred in the event of a substantial corporate transaction. </p>
                  
                  <p>There are a number of places on our Site where you may click on a hyperlink to access other web sites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy.  Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the web sites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States. </p>
                  
                  <p>BeautyRiot will notify you when information about you may be provided to third parties in ways other than explained above, and you will have the option to prevent such information sharing.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Aggregated and Non-Personal Information</strong></p>
                  <p>We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Site, affiliated web sites and on third-party web sites. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our Site and the most popular areas and features of our Site. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop content and new services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising. </p>
                  <p>We hire vendors, including Google, to undertake our remarketing program, which allows us to communicate with people who have previously visited key pages on the BeautyRiot Site.  These third party vendors, may show BeautyRiot ads on sites on the internet and use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to the BeautyRiot Site.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Other</strong></p>
                  <p>From time to time, we may use your information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this Privacy Policy. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Site to notify you of these changes and we will use for these new purposes only data collected from the time of the policy change forward.

Our Site may also feature areas where you may access other interactive features and post information from time to time, such as bulletin boards. Such postings are governed by our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>. In addition, such postings may appear on other web sites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages.
