                  <p><strong>The Information We Collect; How We Collect It</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>We may request at times that you voluntarily supply us with personal information. Such personal information includes any information that may be used to identify a specific individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number(s) and other contact information.  Generally some or all of this information is requested when you register on the Site or when you provide information in connection with sweepstakes, contests, surveys and samples programs. We may request information about your interests and activities, your gender and age, and other demographic information. Some of the information BeautyRiot collects is not explicitly submitted by you – BeautyRiot also automatically receives and records information on its server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, the web pages you request, your browser type and language, access times, the searches you undertake, and the referring web site address.  For instance, when you visit our Site, we may assign your computer one or more cookies, to facilitate access to our Site and to personalize your online experience. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on our Site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on the Site. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies, and you should be able to remove existing cookies by following your browser help file directions. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features offered on our Site. </p>
                  
                  <p>We also may use standard other technologies, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of our Site. We also may include web beacons in promotional or other e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer our Site users to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities.</p>
                  
                  <p>WWe use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements when you visit our Site.

                  <p><strong>The Information Collected by Third Parties Using Technology </strong></p>
                  
                  <p>BeautyRiot, its service providers, or third party advertisers or their service providers may use third-party advertising technology to customize the ads you see on our Site based on your previous online activity on this Site and other sites. This is sometimes called “interest based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising,” and it is intended to deliver ads that are relevant to your interests and thereby enhance your online experience. For instance, certain advertisers may place unique cookies or other electronic tools on your browser that gather non-personally identifiable information regarding your online activities on this Site and others.  This information may then be used, alone or in conjunction with other information, to make inferences about your interests, and then display to you advertisements that are tailored to your particular interests while you are on this Site or other web sites. The collection and use of your information by our service providers, third-party advertisers or their service providers is not covered by this Privacy Policy nor is it within our control.  If you would like to learn more about interest based advertising or if you would like to opt out of having interest-based information collected during your visits to this Site or other web sites, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">here</a></p>
