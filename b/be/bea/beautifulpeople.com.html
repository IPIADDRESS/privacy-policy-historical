<h1 class="text_pages_headlines">With whom we share your information</h1>
<p>We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we
have collected about you or your activities on our web site or while using our services.</p>
<p>Personal information. We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated
below or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal
information shared. We may share personal information with:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Authorized service providers:</strong> We may share your
personal information, which may include your name and
contact information (including email address) with our
authorized service providers that perform certain services
on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders,
providing customer service and marketing assistance,
performing business and sales analysis, supporting our
website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes,
surveys and other features offered through our website. We
may also share your name, contact information and credit
card information with our authorized service providers who
process credit card payments. These service providers may
have access to personal information needed to perform
their functions but are not permitted to share or use such
information for any other purposes.</li>
	<li><strong>Business partners:</strong> When you make purchases or engage in
promotions offered through our website or our services, we
may share personal information with the businesses with which
we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions,
contests and/or sweepstakes. When you elect to engage in
a particular merchant's offer or program, you authorize us
to provide your email address and other information to that
merchant. We will always provide you with the opportunity not
to share information with these businesses.</li>
	<li><strong>Direct mail partners.</strong> From time to time we may share
our postal mailing list with selected providers of goods and
services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to
receive mailings from these providers, you can notify us at any
time by opting out at the time you register for our site, or at
any time thereafter by visiting the “Account Settings” page for
your account.</li>
	<li><strong>Other People Network ApS businesses.</strong> We are part of
the People Network ApS family of businesses. We may share
information we collect, including personal information such
as your name and contact information, interests, activities
and transactions on our site, with the People Network ApS
companies. Sharing information with our People Network ApS
companies enables us to provide you with information about
a variety of products and services that might interest you.
Our People Network ApS companies also will comply with
applicable privacy and security laws and, at a minimum, in
any commercial e-mail they send to you, will give you the
opportunity to choose not to receive such e-mail messages in
the future.</li>
	<li><strong>Other Situations.</strong> We also may disclose your information,
including personal information:
		<ul>
			<li>In response to a subpoena or similar investigative
demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation
from law enforcement or other government agency; to
establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against
legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such
cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right
available to us.</li>
			<li>When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection
with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action
regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other
wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property
or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or
others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with
law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and
conditions or other agreements or policies.</li>
			<li>In connection with a substantial corporate transaction,
such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger,
consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of
bankruptcy.</li>
		</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy
policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern
use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third
parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices,
we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be
located either inside or outside your country. Aggregated and non-personal information. We may
share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances.
We may also share it with third parties and our People Network ApS sister companies to develop
and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine
non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other
sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers
and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our
advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services accessed.
This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop website
content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and
advertising.</p>

<h1 class="text_pages_headlines">Third-party websites</h1>
<p>There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites
that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement on our
website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may
independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some
instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that
you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the “privacy” link
typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</p>

<h1 class="text_pages_headlines">How you can access your information</h1>
<p>If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal
information online by logging into your account and editing your profile information and your account
settings.</p>
<p>If you have an online account with us, you also may choose to remove your profile at any time
by visiting the “Account Settings” page for your account. After you remove your profile all of your
information will no longer be accessible. If you wish to return to BeautifulPeople you will need to
re-apply. If you remove your profile, we may still retain certain information associated with your
account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any
fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity
of our web site or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain
information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of
that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.</p>

<h1 class="text_pages_headlines">Your choices about collection and use of your
information</h1>
<ul>
	<li>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but
that may result in you being unable to use certain features
of our website because such information may be required in
order for you to register as a member; purchase products
or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or
sweepstakes; be found by your friends; or initiate other
transactions on our website.</li>
	<li>At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or
promotional emails from us by visiting the “Account Settings”
page associated with your account. By visiting the “Account
Settings” page you can select which types of mails you want
to receive from BeautifulPeople. You also will be given the
opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you,
to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may
take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We
may send you other types of transactional and relationship
e-mail communications, such as service announcements,
administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the
opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that
changing information in your account, or otherwise opting
out of receipt of promotional email communications will only
affect future activities or communications from us. If we have
already provided your information to a third party (such as a
service provider) before you have changed your preferences
or updated your information, you may have to change you
preferences directly with that third party.</li>
	<li>You may tell us not to share your personal information with
third parties or the People Network ApS. family of companies
for direct marketing purposes by checking the appropriate
opt-out selection by visiting the “Account Settings” page
associated with your account after you have registered.</li>
	<li>In certain places on our site we may ask for your phone
number. In those places where we ask for your phone number,
we will always tell you how your phone number will be used
– either to provide you a service you requested from us or to
call you to inform you about one of our products in which you
have expressed an interest. We will not call you for marketing
purposes unless you provide us your phone number specifically
to receive such calls. If you have previously provided us your
phone number but no longer wish to be contacted by phone
by us, you can visit the “Account Settings” page associated
with your account to let us know your wishes. Under our
Do Not Call policy you may instruct us not to call you for
marketing purposes by informing anyone who contacts you by
phone in our behalf that you do not wish to receive marketing
calls from us. You can also instruct us at any time not to
call you for marketing purposes by informing our Customer
Care department by phone or email. We will implement your
instructions as soon as possible, and in no event later 30
days after receiving your instructions. We have policies and
procedures in place and train our employees to honor your
request. Please note that we may still need to call you for
servicing or other non- marketing purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="text_pages_headlines">How we protect your personal information</h1>
<p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to
help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example,
only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only
for permitted business functions. In addition, we use SSL encryption in the transmission of your
sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent
unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.</p>
<p>We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be
completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise,
and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will
always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal
information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to
the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for
information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>

<h1 class="text_pages_headlines">Information you provide about yourself while
using our service</h1>
<p>We provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and
communicate with others or upload content such as photographs. Such postings are governed by
our Terms of use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are
executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information
on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and
used by others. For example, if you post your email address on your public profile, in a group or on a
blog, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other
users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion
and caution with respect to your personal information.</p>

<h1 class="text_pages_headlines">Children's privacy</h1>
<p>Although our website is a general audience site, we restrict the use of our service to individuals age 18
and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18.</p>

<h1 class="text_pages_headlines">Visiting our websites from your country</h1>
<p>Please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in Denmark
where our central database is located and operated. The data protection and other laws of Denmark
and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that
we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our services,
you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with
whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.</p>

<h1 class="text_pages_headlines">No Rights of Third Parties</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any
personal information relating to users of the website.</p>

<h1 class="text_pages_headlines">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When
we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the “last updated” date at the top of this Privacy
Policy. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal
information, we will notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided
us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an email address), and/or by
prominently posting notice of the changes on our website. We recommend that you check our website
from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.</p>

<h1 class="text_pages_headlines">How to contact us</h1>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our information-handling practices, or if you
would like to request information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their
direct marketing purposes, please contact us by e-mail or postal mail as follows:

<p>Cookies:</p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies
can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your
browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie remains on
your hard drive for an extended period of time. Cookies on our website do not link to or store your
personal information.</p>
<p>For example, when you sign in to our website, we will record your user or member ID and the name
associated with your user or member ID in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your
password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic
sign-in. For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member
account- related data that we store in such cookies. In the case of sites and services that do not use
a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may allow our authorized service
providers to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as
doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising.</p>
<p>You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click “Help” in the toolbar of
most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of our website may
not function properly.</p>
<p>We may allow third-parties, including People Network ApS. companies, advertising companies, and
ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies,
such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements.
Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect
information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the
advertisements they deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the
advertised websites. They also may combine this information with personal information they collect
from you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party's privacy policy.
This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some
of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the
Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member
companies (www.networkadvertising.org). This policy covers the use of cookies by BeautifulPeople
only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<p>Web Beacons:</p>
<p>Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique
identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or
to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, web beacons are
embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of
this sentence.</p>
<p>Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited
certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may receive an anonymous identification
number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.</p>
