            <h3>Collection and Use of Information</h3>

            <p>While using the Mefeedia Service you may, among other things, gather information on our website, publish
                and download content, subscribe to one of our services. In doing so, we may collect certain information
                about you.</p>

            <p>We may automatically collect certain aggregated data regarding use of the Mefeedia Service, like the
                number of users and frequency and manner of usage of the Mefeedia Service. We may also collect
                aggregated information regarding the use of our service network, such as the extent to which certain
                features are used. Aggregated information is anonymous, statistical information that reflects the scope
                of our user base, sales, customer patterns and related site information. We use this information to
                better understand how the Mefeedia Service is used, and to improve the online experience of our users.
                This information is not used in a way that will personally identify you. In addition, certain
                non-personally identifiable information is collected by Mefeedia and our third-party advertising
                providers during the course of use of our Service and for example, in serving advertisements to our
                website, including, for example, the number of times you have viewed an advertisement (but not your
                name, address, or other personal information). Such information is used by Mefeedia and our advertising
                providers to facilitate and monitor the serving of advertisements. Similarly, we may also use cookies to
                track and understand the traffic on our website. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that our website
                places onto your computer’s hard drive. Cookies identify your computer hard drive so that we can
                recognize you the next time you visit us. We use cookies to collect and store some information about
                you, such as the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, the Internet Protocol
                (IP) address of the computer you are using, the date and time you access our website and the Internet
                address of the website from which you linked directly to our website. We use this information to better
                understand our users and customize our site for users’ particular preferences. In the same manner, we
                may also engage third parties to monitor the usage of, and serve advertising to, the Mefeedia Service.
                These third parties may use cookies and web beacons (which collect non-personally identifiable
                information regarding user behavior on our website) to collect such information, which is also used to
                better understand our users and customize our site for users’ particular preferences. You may disable
                cookies by following directions on your web browser. Disabling cookies also disables web beacons. You
                should be aware, however, that by disabling cookies you may be unable to access certain services and
                features of the Mefeedia Service.</p>

                may include, but is not limited to, your name, physical and e-mail addresses, phone and/or fax numbers,
                Internet address, type of computer , as well as your preferences and usage patterns. This information

                support your online activities, to respond to your questions, to customize your experience and to
                customize the content or features of the Mefeedia Service. We may use your personally identifiable
                information to notify you of changes to the Mefeedia Service, Terms of Use and/or Privacy Policy. We may
                also use your personally identifiable information to personalize your interactive experience on the
                Mefeedia Service. For example, if you have given us permission, we may use your information to inform
                you of other products or services that you may find valuable. We may also use the information you
                provide to make improvements that better serve our users’ needs. To edit your personal information that

                including our distributors, vendors, actual and potential customers and third-parties that offer

            <p>
                Mefeedia will not share your personally identifiable information with any third-parties, with the
                following exceptions:

                As necessary to third parties who perform services for us in operating and marketing the Mefeedia
                Service, included but not limited to the monitoring of user behavior on our website and the processing
                of payments for products or services.
            </p>

            <p>
                We may be obliged or deem it necessary or appropriate to disclose your information in certain special
                situations. These situations include: in response to legal process such as a court order or subpoena; to
                prevent or combat fraud; as required by federal or state law; enforcement of our Terms of Use; and
                protection of the rights, property or safety of Mefeedia, our users or others.
            </p>

            <p>
                We may disclose your information in connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of our company
                and to parents, subsidiaries or affiliates of Mefeedia.
            </p>

            <h3>Security</h3>

            <p>
                Mefeedia is committed to taking appropriate measures to protect your privacy against unauthorized
                disclosures. Mefeedia uses a variety of secure techniques designed to protect your information.

                While we have implemented safeguards, you should be aware that Internet security technology rapidly
                changes. As such, we cannot guarantee that the safeguards we employ today can protect your personal
                information from the threats of tomorrow, or that our security measures are failsafe and not subject to
                circumvention or unauthorized intrusion. You should also be aware that, despite our best efforts,
                factors beyond our control may result in disclosure of data.
            </p>

            <h3>Third-Party Links</h3>

            <p>
                Portions of the Mefeedia Service may contain links to other third party websites that you may access.
                These other sites have their own privacy policies, and you should review those policies before following
                those links. We cannot control the information disclosed at these third-party sites or how that
                information is used.
            </p>

            <h3>Young Children</h3>

            <p>
                We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. To best protect
                your child’s privacy, we suggest that you carefully supervise your child’s access to the Internet and
                our website. For more information on how to protect your child’s privacy, you can visit the Federal
                Trade Commission’s Kidzprivacy page, accessible via www.ftc.gov.
            </p>

            <h3>Opt-Out</h3>

            <p>
                The Mefeedia Service provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving certain communications from
                us regarding products and services in which you may be interested. You will be given this opportunity at
                the time we request information about you. If you do not opt-out at the time you provide information,
                but choose to opt-out later, click here to send an email indicating that you no longer wish to receive
                such communications. Please provide your name and physical and/or email address(es) at which you are

            <p>
                You should be aware that the United States and other countries have not harmonized their privacy
                regulations. Because the Mefeedia Service is intended specifically for users in the United States, we
                have written our Privacy Policy to satisfy United States regulations. By using the Mefeedia Service, you
