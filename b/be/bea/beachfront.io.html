                <strong>It’s worth knowing what we will and won’t do with your information</strong><br>

                Beachfront Media, LLC, (“BFM”, “we”, or “us’), is committed to protecting your privacy when you use

                Beachfront.io. The following Privacy Policy was prepared to inform you of the information we collect

                about you, how that information is used, whether and to whom we disclose it, and the choices you have

                regarding your personal information.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is very important that you read and understand our Privacy Policy. If you do not accept the terms set

                out in our Privacy Policy, please do not use Beachfront.io.

                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will advise you that changes have been made

                by posting a notice on our website or otherwise. Your use of our service constitutes your acceptance of

                the terms of our Privacy Policy, as may be amended or revised by us, and you are advised to consult our

                Privacy Policy regularly for any changes (revisions will be reflected by the “last update” notation below).If

                you have any questions regarding BFM’s policies or practices relating to privacy, please direct them

                to <strong><a href="mailto:privacy@beachfrontmedia.com">privacy@beachfrontmedia.com</a>.</strong>
            </p>

            <h3>Our Business</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Beachfront.io is a mobile video advertising platform.</strong> We use our proprietary technology to offer

                advertising solutions to our clients, which includes working with advertisers to deliver their

                advertising campaigns across our network of mobile publishers and application (“app”) developers

                (our “Platform”)
            </p>

            <h3>Information Collection and Sharing</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Website Data Collection.</strong> BFM is the sole owner of the information collected on our Websites. The

                information may consist of both Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Non-Personally Identifiable

                Information (“Non-PII”), and is collected in order to conduct business with current and prospective

                business clients. We do not sell or rent data collected via our Websites to other parties, but we may

                provide it to third parties as necessary to conduct our business operations and to our customers for

                the performance of our Services, or we may disclose such data as otherwise described in this policy.

                BFM uses these data to provide requested information to prospective clients, to establish self-service

                advertiser and publisher accounts, and otherwise as necessary to conduct our business. If you would

                like to review or request changes to PII that you have submitted through our Websites, or would like to

                request that we not share your PII with third parties, please contact us at

                <strong><a href="mailto:support@beachfrontmedia.com">support@beachfrontmedia.com</a></strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Data Collected On Our Platform and from Partners.</strong> BFM collects data from across our Platform. This

                data, which may include anonymous identifiers associated with your mobile device and the location

                of your device, does not identify you personally, and may come from such sources like your mobile

                web browser, or the apps that you use. We use a variety of technologies to collect this data, including

                “cookies,” which are small text files that can be stored on your browser. We may also collect and/or use

                information collected by our partners and shared with us, and data from third party business partners.

                We use this Non-PII along with our technology to perform a variety of tasks, such as improving the

                relevance of the ads, limiting the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same

                mobile device (frequency capping), providing an advertisement to only certain types of mobile devices,

                or providing a report to a client on the number of its advertisements that were clicked. We may share this

                Non-PII with clients, vendors, and other companies with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise

                described in this policy. We may also use some of this data to provide interest-based advertising, as

                discussed more fully below.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Other Information Sharing.</strong> We may also share any aggregate or de-identified information with our

                partners. We may disclose information, including PII, when in our sole judgment we are required to do so

                by law, regulation, or when such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court

                order or legal process. Additionally, there may be times where we will need to disclose information to

                protect our system or our rights or to ensure your safety or the safety of others. We may also transfer all

                or some of the data discussed in this policy, in connection with a corporate merger, acquisition, partial or

                total sale of assets, bankruptcy, or any other corporate change.
            </p>

            <h3>Links to Third-Party Websites and Third-Party Content</h3>
            <p>

                notices or practices of these third-party websites.

                Ads. We may also provide ads that link to third-party sites, third-party apps, or other third-party content

                (“Third-Party Content”). This Privacy Policy does not extend to Third-Party Content, or any services

                offered on Third-Party Content.
            </p>

            <h3>Data Collection On Behalf Of Third Parties</h3>
            <p>
                We may, on behalf of our clients and partners, collect information from end users. This may occur, for

                example, if someone submits information in response to an ad or views an ad that we provide on behalf

                of an advertising client. Such information may consist of PII, non-PII, or both. In such situations, we

                collect the information and provide it to our client, and it will be subject to that client’s privacy practices.
            </p>

            <h3>Transparency and Choice</h3>

                has provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact

                us at <strong><a href="mailto:support@beachfrontmedia.com">support@beachfrontmedia.com</a></strong>. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with

                personally identifiable information, we will delete such information from our files.
            </p>

            <h3>Security</h3>
