            <h3>COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

            <p>You may be asked to provide personal information in certain fields on this website. The personal
                information collected on this site is used for the purpose for which it is requested:</p>
            <ol>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Contact information for potential clients or persons seeking business
                    information is collected in order to contact those persons to provide information about our
                    services. This information may be stored on our servers in the United States. Such information is
                    usually deleted as space requires or in the normal course of business, but can be amended or deleted
                    upon request. To update your information, please contact your account manager or sales
                    representative.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Contact information, such as your name, address, telephone number, or
                    email address, submitted by existing customers with questions, concerns, complaints, or technical
                    support questions, is used only to respond to those inquiries. This contact information may be
                    stored on our servers in the United States. Such information is usually deleted as space requires or
                    in the normal course of business. To update your information, please contact your account manager.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">When you sign up for an email newsletter or alerts about our products
                    and services, Beachfront.iO will use your email address to deliver the newsletter or alerts requested. To
                    review or delete your information or to opt-out of any newsletter, please follow unsubscribe
                    instructions in that email.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">In order to obtain materials for certain materials directly from our
                    website, you have to register at this site. During the registration process, you may be asked for
                    certain information, which may include your name, your email address, the company for which you
                    work, and your country. This registration information is used to validate users when they visit the
                    site. It is also used to send you additional promotional information about our services. If you were
                    entered in a Beachfront.iO promotion in connection with your registration, we will also use your name and
                    email address to contact you if you have won a prize in that promotion, and will ask you for the
                    land address at which you would like to receive your prize.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

            <p style="font-weight: normal;">The ads.beachfront.io  and www.beachfront.io websites (Beachfront.iO Sites) use cookies. A
                “cookie” is a small text file that contains a string of alphanumeric characters. There are two types of
                cookies that may be used at the Beachfront.iO Sites: a persistent cookie and a session cookie. A persistent
                cookie gets entered by your Web browser into the “Cookies” folder on your computer and remains in this
                “Cookies” folder after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on
                subsequent visits to the site. A session cookie is held temporarily in your computer’s memory and
                disappears after you close your browser or shut off your computer. Beachfront.iO Sites may also use Web beacons
                (also called “clear GIFs” or “pixel tags”) in conjunction with cookies. Web beacons are small strings of
                code that are placed in a Web page.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: normal;">If you have arrived at this website by clicking on a banner ad for one of
                our products or services, a session cookie may be used. This cookie will contain an identification
                number for the ad that you clicked on, or will contain an identification number for the site that you
                were visiting when you clicked on the banner ad. This session cookie helps Beachfront.iO’s Marketing Department
                determine which of our ads attract the most visitors. If, after you arrive at our site, you choose to
                request further information from us about our products and services, the personal information that you
                provide in that request will be linked to the information in the session cookie. This also helps Beachfront.iO’s
                Marketing Department measure the effectiveness of our advertising. This “linking” will not be used to
                target future advertisements to you or to send you emails about future goods and services. You will
                receive emails about our products only if you tell us on the product request page that you want us to
                send them to you. Because this is a session cookie, it will disappear once you have closed your browser.
                If you return to our site via another one of our ads, you will appear as a new visitor unless and until
                you provide further personal information.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: normal;">Beachfront.iO Sites may use persistent cookies, Web beacons and information
                collected in our log files (such as Internet Protocol Address, referring URLs, etc.) about your activity
                at this site to better understand how the website is used, resolve technical problems, and enhance your
                experience at this site. Information from website analysis cookies or about website usage is not
                combined with information from any other Beachfront.iO cookie. We use a third-party email technology to send
                emails that you have agreed to receive. Web beacons are used in those email messages to measure the
                effectiveness of our advertising.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: normal;">In addition, Beachfront.iO may serve ads on this and other websites using our own ad
                serving technology. In doing so, one of our ad servers will place or read a unique ad-serving cookie on
                your computer and will use non-personal information about your browser and your activity at this site to
                serve ads on this and other sites. The ad serving cookie is a persistent cookie.</p>

            <h3>INFORMATION SHARING OR DISCLOSURE</h3>

            <p style="font-weight: normal;">In the event that we contract with a third party to provide some part of the
                information or service that you have requested, Beachfront.iO may provide your information to such third party,
                or such third party may collect information from you on our behalf. By written agreement, these third
                parties are required to implement similar security measures and to process your information only as
                authorized by Beachfront.iO to fulfill the service(s) that they have been contracted to provide. Other than
                these entities, who act on our behalf, information you provide at this site will not be transferred to
                unrelated third parties, unless we have your permission to do so. However, please note that personal
                information provided to this site may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government
                subpoenas, warrants or orders.</p>

            <h3>CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</h3>

            <p style="font-weight: normal;">Beachfront.iO has implemented reasonable security measures in order to protect both
                personal and non-personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration
                or destruction. Our employees are made aware of and are accountable for compliance with these
                procedures.</p>

            <h3>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

            <p style="font-weight: normal;">We may amend this privacy policy from time to time as we add new products
                and services, as we improve our current offerings, and as technologies change. If we make any material
                or substantive changes in our treatment of information collected on our web sites, we will notify you by
                posting a clear and conspicuous notice of these changes on our website and in this privacy policy.</p>

            <h3>CHANGES IN CORPORATE STRUCTURE</h3>

            <p style="font-weight: normal;">If all or part of the company is sold, merged or otherwise transferred to
                another entity, the information that you have provided at this site may be transferred as part of that
                transaction. However, Beachfront.iO will take reasonable steps to assure that such information is used in a
                manner consistent with the Beachfront.iO privacy policy under which it was collected.</p>
