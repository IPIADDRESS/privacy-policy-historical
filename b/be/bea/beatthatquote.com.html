Privacy Policy <br>
<br>
1. This Privacy Policy <br>
<br>
1.1 BeatThatQuote™ is committed to protecting your personal information and other data provided to BeatThatQuote™ via this Website. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully as it contains important information about the use of any information you provide to BeatThatQuote™ via this Website. This Privacy Policy explains what information BeatThatQuote™ collects about you, and how BeatThatQuote™ collects and uses your information, including setting out the circumstances where BeatThatQuote™ could provide it to third parties. You should also read the separate BeatThatQuote™ User Terms that are applicable to this Website. To view the User Terms click on the link shown below. <br>
<br>
1.2 Because of the financial nature of BeatThatQuote™’s business, BeatThatQuote™’s products and services are not designed to appeal to or to be sold to persons under the age of 18. Therefore, BeatThatQuote™ does not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children. <br>
<br>

<br>
2.1 To take advantage of some of the services offered via this Website you might be required to register your details.

The information will be collected when you register with the Website or when you choose to use one of the services available via the Website. <br>
<br>
2.2 BeatThatQuote™ may use the information which it collects to personalise your experience on the Website, to help you to log-in in future, to continue to use the Website, and to help BeatThatQuote™ select services or materials for inclusion on the Website which may be of interest to you. BeatThatQuote™ may, from time to time, use your information to recommend other products or services to you.

If, at any time, you would rather not receive any such information, please either tick any relevant “opt-out? box on the page where you are asked to give your information or you may contact BeatThatQuote™ via the link shown below. In these circumstances, BeatThatQuote™ will need to keep your information on file so that you can continue to use the Website and so that BeatThatQuote™ can deal with the administration and security of the Website, but BeatThatQuote™ will not e-mail you or contact you by telephone, fax or post without your consent. <br>
<br>
2.4 The nature of BeatThatQuote™’s business is such that BeatThatQuote™ may on occasion ask you to provide sensitive personal data as defined in the Data Protection Act 1998 (for example, questions relating to your health where that information is required in order to provide life insurance quotations).

<br>
2.5 BeatThatQuote™ or third parties hosting servers on BeatThatQuote™’s behalf may also monitor traffic patterns and usage of the Website to help it to improve the Website design and lay out.  Such monitoring will not be identifiable to your personal use of the Website. <br>
