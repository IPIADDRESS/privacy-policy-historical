  <h3 class="c10"><span class="c4">INFORMATION ABOUT SPECIFIC PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ON OUR WEBSITE</span></h3>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">The following sections form part of the terms and conditions and provide more specific guidance on certain products and services.</span></p>
  <a name="insurance_products"></a>
  <h4 class="c10"><span class="c21">Insurance products</span></h4>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">We are regulated by the Financial Services Authority.</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">In this respect, we are an appointed representative of Best Value Financial Services Limited that is authorised and regulated by the Financial Services Authority. </span></p>
  <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">Our Insurance Service</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">Our insurance service allows you to compare providers for a range of insurance products. You will need to answer a number of questions on our website in order for the product providers to provide you accurate quotations for the product(s) you are interested in. In this respect it is very important that you answer all the questions asked accurately and truthfully because we and the insurance product providers' results we show to you will rely on your answers. If you are in any doubt as to whether any information is relevant you should disclose it. If you do not provide all such information your selected insurer may be able to treat your insurance policy as void (as if it never existed). With respect to our life insurance product, this service is different as it allows you to be contacted by a specialist who may be able to assist you further with your enquiry.</span></p>
  <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">If you complete an enquiry form for an insurance product on our website we will conduct a search for policies and will display the results on the screen. To assist you in completing the enquiry form, we may provide defaulted answers to some questions, and in other instances obtain certain information from third parties (such as motor vehicle data and address details). Please ensure that this information is complete and accurate, and change it if necessary. We will also email you details of the quotes you have obtained from Our system with appropriate links to allow you to purchase an insurance policy.</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">Insurers and brokers on our panel may use the information you supply in the enquiry form to carry out credit checks through licensed credit-referencing agencies. This forms part of their underwriting process which determines your eligibility for a quote. A copy of such searches will be held on your credit record. We do not carry out any such credit searches nor do we have any access to this information.</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">Insurers and brokers also subscribe to industry databases to check the information provided in your enquiry form to reduce incidences of fraud. They may therefore search these databases before providing you with an insurance quotation. We do not have access to these databases.</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">If you have agreed to receive newsletters and marketing material from us, the information you supply on your original enquiry form may be used by us to produce further indicative quotations for you (typically approximately one month before the anniversary of your original cover start date). In order for us to do this the insurers and brokers may carry out checks of the same type as those described above. Please let us know by contacting </span><span class="c18">contact@beatthatquote.com</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;if you do not want us to do this or alternatively unsubscribe from receiving newsletters and marketing material from us.</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">You are also able to save your details on our system and use these as the basis for making amended or new quotation requests in future.</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">If you choose to purchase an insurance policy following completion of an enquiry form on our website, we remind you again of </span><span class="c15"><a class="c13" href="#you_liability">your responsibilities</a></span><span class="c6">&nbsp;(as set out above) to ensure the insurance product provider has the correct information about you and that you understand that you agree with the terms and conditions of that insurance product provider including the restrictions, exclusions and conditions of that policy. You may also be contacted by product providers whose prices are displayed in your results, who may be able to provide alternative quotes that are not available online.</span></p>
