    <p><em>(Please note this version of the Privacy and Security Policy does not substantively change the way Glam Media, Inc. treats personally identifiable information compared to the <a href="http://www.glammedia.com/about_glam/legal/privacyandsecuritypolicy-previousversion12-15-2010.php" target="_blank">previous version of the Privacy and Security Policy</a>.)</em></p>
    <p>Glam Media, Inc. ("Glam Media") owns and operates this website (the "Site") and other websites focused on women, men, and social media consumers, (collectively the "Glam Media Sites").

That advertising network consists of the Glam Media Sites, and websites owned by third-party publishers displaying Glam Media branding and/or Glam Media logos ("Affiliated Sites"; together with the Glam Media Sites, the "Glam Media Network"). Glam Media may, from time to time, also deliver advertising to websites owned by third-party publishers that are not part of the Glam Media Network ("Non-Affiliated Sites"). This Privacy and Security Policy applies to (i) the collection of information on the Glam Media Sites that link to or display this Privacy and Security Policy and the use of that information, (ii) the collection of information on the Affiliated Sites and the use of that information when you view ads from our advertisers, and (iii) the collection of information on the Non-Affiliated Sites and the use of that information when you view ads from our advertisers.</p>
    <h1><a name="_Privacy and Security Policy Overview" id="_PrivacyandSecurityPolicyOverview">Privacy and Security Policy Overview</a></h1>

    <p><strong>We do not sell your personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable information to third parties for any reason. </strong>We do not disclose your personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties who may want to offer you their own products and services unless you have requested or authorized us to do so. We may share your personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information with third parties, or affiliates of Glam Media where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something you have asked us to do. For example, we might need to provide your personally identifiable information to third parties, such as advertisers, featured on a Glam Media Site, or through a website participating in the Glam Media Network or a Non-Affiliated Site so they can process and fulfill your request for more information from them; and in these instances, we will provide you with a notice at the time of collection that the information is being shared, to whom it is being shared and the privacy policy governing the use of the information collected and shared. We may share your personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information with third parties with whom we have contracted to perform services on our behalf, or affiliates of Glam Media. All companies that act on our behalf are contractually obligated to keep the personal information we provide to them confidential and to use the personal information we share only to provide the services we ask them to perform.</p>
    <p>We may disclose personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information about our customers as permitted or required by law, such as in connection with a subpoena or similar legal process, or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy, as discussed further below.</p>
    <h2><a name="_OurDataRetentionPolicy" id="_OurDataRetentionPolicy"><em>Our Data Retention Policy</em></a> </h2>
    <p>Glam Media is required to retain certain non–personally identifiable information collected from users of the Glam Media Sites, Affiliated Sites and Non-Affiliated Sites in order to provide audited information to advertisers and auditors. As a result, ad reporting and delivery data is retained for a period of 18 months. After 18 months, some of the ad reporting and delivery data may be aggregated for statistical purposes and retained indefinitely. Log files that associate individual advertising with a specific IP address will be retained by Glam Media for 18 months and during that time will be used for internal analysis and ad delivery purposes. Certain aggregated, non-personally identifiable information including historical data and attributes collected by Glam Media prior to an opt out election and which represent large numbers of users combined into aggregated statistical data and information shall be kept for 18 months and despite the fact that the user has opted out, the information will continue to be associated with the users cookie regardless of the opt out status. After 18 months some of the aggregated, non-personally identifiable information may be further aggregated for statistical purposes and retained indefinitely.</p>
    <p>Additionally, Glam Media reserves the right to retain and use any information described in this Privacy and Security Policy as reasonably necessary to comply with all laws or regulations, regardless of any limitations set forth in this Policy. Glam Media reserves the right to change its data retention policy and the new data retention policy shall apply to all data collected following such change. </p>
    <p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GLAM MEDIA'S LIABILITY REGARDING ANY DISPUTE OVER PRIVACY OR RELATED TO THIS PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY ARE HEREBY LIMITED AS SET FORTH IN THE GLAM MEDIA SITES TERMS OF USE. </p>

    <p>The Glam Media Sites are hosted in the United States and are intended for United States visitors. This Privacy and Security Policy applies to customer relationships established in the United States. Parts of this Privacy and Security Policy may not apply to visitors outside the United States. Like almost every website, the Glam Media Sites may be accessed by an international audience. If you are a non-U.S. visitor to any of the Glam Media Sites, by providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed for the purposes identified in this Privacy and Security Policy.

    <h2><a name="_OurPrivacyandSecurityPolicyWillChangeOverTime" id="_OurPrivacyandSecurityPolicyWillChangeOverTime"><em>Our Privacy and Security Policy Will Change Over Time</em></a> </h2>
    <p>Because we continue to develop and take advantage of technologies to improve the services we provide, we reserve the right to change, or modify, any portion of this, or any other policy, from time to time without prior notice and any changes will become effective immediately upon being posted unless you are advised otherwise. We encourage you to refer to this Privacy and Security Policy from time to time to stay abreast of our most current privacy policy practices.
