<ul>
<li><p><strong>To provide you with the products and services that you have requested</strong>, to administer our relationship with you and to carry out our obligations arising from the relationship between you and us, including internal accounting and administration purposes, to process payment for purchases or other services and to create and manage your account.</p></li>

We will also use your personal information across the Coty Sites to provide a seamless user experience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>For analytics purposes</strong>, for example we may analyze your information including your location, products and/or services requested, age, time zone, IP address and URL visited, against our wider customer base for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans, to improve our services and products, the Coty Sites and Coty Content. We may also aggregate and de-identify your information to create customer segments and share with our licensees and partners.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>To provide you with marketing communications that you might be interested in</strong>, for example, if you choose to receive marketing communications from us, we may use your information to keep you up to date with our latest products, services, surveys, announcements, upcoming events, sweepstakes, contests and other promotions and competitions via our newsletters, emails, or other communications.

We may use tailored advertising to specifically include or exclude individuals who have registered for our products and services to ensure that you are provided with information about those products or services that are most relevant to you. To do this, we may track your browsing activity across different websites, different Devices and/or different applications. We may match your browsing activity on one Device, such as your mobile phone, with your browsing activity on another device, such as your tablet, to ensure our advertising is tailored to you. If you longer wish to see tailored advertising, you may be able to amend your cookie preferences (see: section: "<a href="#does-coty-use-cookies">Does Coty use cookies and other similar technologies?</a>").  In addition, some third party sites allow you to stop seeing advertisements from specific advertisers on that site, so you should also check your preferences on those websites.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>For non-marketing communications</strong>, for example we may use your personal information to communicate with you important information in relation to your account, the service you have requested or other non-marketing communications. This includes: (i) emailing you to verify your identity when you sign-up; (ii) emailing you where you have requested a password and/or username reset; (iii) notifying you that a particular service has been suspended for maintenance or terminated; (iv) letting you know that we have updated this Notice or our <a href="http://coty.com/terms-use">Terms of Use</a>; or (v) letting you know about any products or services that you have requested or purchased. We will never contact you to ask for your password. Please be careful if you receive any communications from people requesting this information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>To provide the best service to our customers and consumers</strong>, for example, we may use your personal information to process and respond to your questions and/or inquiries</p></li>
