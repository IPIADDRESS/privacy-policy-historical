the Bebo Web sites and other features and services offered by Bebo and its corporate affiliates in connection with the sites, such as e-mail and instant messaging (collectively the ’Bebo Service‘).
</p><p>Bebo and its employees take your privacy very seriously.  To make it easier for you to read and understand our privacy policy, we’ve written it in plain language and tried to keep
 it to a reasonably short length.
</p><p>The key points of our privacy policy are:
</p><ul>
<li>We give you choices about the personally identifiable information you share with Bebo and other Bebo users.</li>
<li>You can end your membership at any time.</li>
<li>We only disclose information from which you may be personally identifiable to selected third parties in accordance with this privacy policy.</li>
<li>Bebo does not spam.</li>
<li>By participating in the Bebo community, you agree to this privacy policy.</li>
</ul>

<p>We use this information in order to operate the Bebo Service and improve your experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will display your personally identifiable information on your profile according to the preferences you set. We will use your name so that you are recognisable on our database and
