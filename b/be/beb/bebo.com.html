<p class="m_b">Our Commitment to You</p>

<p>Welcome to Bebo.com, the next generation social networking site where
members can stay in touch with their friends, meet new people and hang
out. The founders and employees of Bebo take your privacy very
seriously. To make it easier for you to read and understand our
privacy policy, we did the unconventional thing -- we wrote it in
plain English and tried to keep it to a reasonably short length.</p>

<p>The key points of our privacy policy are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your privacy remains under your control.</li>
<li>You can end your membership at any time.</li>
<li>We only disclose information from which you may be personally identifiable to selected third parties in accordance with this privacy policy.</li>
<li>Bebo does not spam.</li>
<li>By participating in the Bebo community, you agree to this privacy policy.</li>
</ul>

<p class="m_b">Information collected by Bebo</p>

you use Bebo:</p>

personal information, such as your name and email address, when you
register to become a member of Bebo.com. This information is used when
you set up your personal profile. As part of your personal profile,
you may choose to submit additional information such as your age, your

</ul>

<p class="m_b">Use and Disclosure of information</p>
<ul>
<li>We will display your personal information on your profile according to the preferences you set.
