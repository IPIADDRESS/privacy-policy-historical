You may unsubscribe from future text notifications by unsubscribing in the method indicated in the notification. </p>        </li>        <li>          <p><strong>It Helps Our Teams Operate More Efficiently to Keep the Site and App Running Smoothly.</strong> We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and service operations that we provide to you (e.g., search technology, email support) and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers. These internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced Bebo related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses.</p>        </li>        <li>          <p><strong>In some instances, the internal service provider may collect information directly from you (such as for Bebo surveys).</strong> In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your personal information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.</p>        </li>        <li>          <p><strong>We Provide only Non-Specific Information to Advertisers.</strong> We disclose non-personally identifiable aggregated (gather up data across all User accounts) information to advertisers and other third parties. An example of non-personally identifiable information would be the number of times a particular page has been viewed or how many Users have a particular experience in common. We may track Visitor activity on an aggregated basis as well.</p>        </li>        <li>          <p><strong>We Cooperate with Law Enforcement; We Meet Industry Standards of Privacy Protection.</strong> Bebo cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the Bebo service. Therefore, in response to a genuine request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can disclose personal information about you. Third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site or App. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</p>        </li>        <li>          <p><strong>If we Sell our Business.</strong> It is possible that as we continue to develop our Site and App and our business, Bebo' Site, App, and/or related assets might be acquired.
