<p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>If this privacy policy is modified, the revised policy will be posted on this website within a reasonable time. This privacy policy was last updated on December 28, 2012.</p>
<h2>Disclosure Policy Regarding Vendor Relationships<span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: large;"><br></span></strong></span></h2>
<p>It is a wise practice for you, as a consumer, to carefully consider a product recommendation or endorsement made by a third-party website. However, it also <strong>not</strong> in your best interest to assume that the information provided there is invalid just because the vendor and that website have some kind of financial relationship.</p>
<p>So, here are some thoughts to consider:</p>
<p>Though we always provide our most honest and accurate assessment, much of the information we provide is readily verifiable. We suggest that you always do your own due diligence.</p>
<p>In the process of evaluating a product, it is necessary for us to give you our subjective judgment. With our extensive product research experience and our background in this field, we believe we are qualified to make a considered judgment about any of the products on this website. That said, predicting the satisfaction of potential customers is impossible. There are simply too many unknowns.</p>
<p>We always provide links to the product maker’s website to make available to you additional information that is not on our website. This information may include customer testimonials, certain product details, sales information, free newsletters and even samples. Once again, we encourage you to add your research to ours and make the best decision FOR YOU.</p>
<p>We, the owners of this website, ARE compensated for your purchase of SOME of the products mentioned on this website ONLY if the following steps are taken. If you click a link on our website that takes you to a page on a vendor’s website, and then you purchase a product there, we will be compensated in the form of a commission on the product IF we are an affiliate for that product.</p>
<p>We are affiliates ONLY for products that we recommend. Conversely, we research and discuss many products that we do NOT recommend and for which we do NOT have an affiliate relationship. We are NOT compensated by ANY product maker prior to a sale and are not given ANY kind of inducement by the vendor for our recommendation of its product(s). Sometimes, however, a vendor will allow us to try its product for free in order for us to evaluate it.</p>
<p>In short, we do recommend or endorse certain products. Our recommendations are ALWAYS based on our belief that the product maker is trustworthy and that its product provides excellent value. This belief is based on either our assessment of the maker and its product or our prior experience with the maker and similar products made by that company.</p>
<p>We also ask that you keep in mind that this website is our livelihood and, as such, exists only through compensation arrangements such as this. We hope that you receive the benefits you desire from the work we do through this website. In addition, the cost of the product to you is NO HIGHER whether you buy directly from the maker’s website, through another independent website, or through our website. In some cases, the product will cost you LESS because of discounts we arrange with the vendor for you, our audience.</p>
<p>We hope that you will support our efforts by purchasing products you feel are right for you through the links on our website. Thank you for the trust you place in us for helping you find the right product to help you in improving your brain health and fitness.</p>
