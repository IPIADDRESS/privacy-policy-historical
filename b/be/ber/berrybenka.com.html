			<p>Welcome to Berrybenka.com  (“Site”). We respect your privacy and want to protect your personal  information. To learn more, please continue reading this Privacy Policy. We  will not disclose personal information to third parties except where it may be part  of providing a service to you - e.g. arranging for goods to be sent to you,  carrying out credit and other security checks, and for the purposes of customer  research and profiling or where we have your express permission to do so.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how  we collect, use, protect, and in some cases, disclose your personal information.  By visiting this Site, you accept the practices described in this Policy. This Privacy Policy does not necessarily  apply to any offline collection of your personal information. Please see below  for details.</p>
            <p><strong>1. Types of Information  Collected and Uses of Collected Information</strong> <br>
              We collect two types of  information about our Site Users: Personally Identifiable Information and  Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Personally Identifiable  Information.</strong>&nbsp;Personally  Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific end user.  When you engage in certain activities on the Site, such as creating an account,  filling out a survey, ordering a product or service from us, posting an opinion,  sending us feedback, requesting information about our products and services, or  applying for a job through the Site (collectively, "Identification  Activities"), we may ask you to provide certain information about  yourself. It is optional for you to engage in these Identification Activities.  If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you  to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as but not  limited to your first and last name, mailing address, email address, telephone  number, and date of birth. When you order products or services, we may also ask  you to provide us with your bank account number, credit card number, expiration  date, and authentication codes or related information. Depending on the  activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as  mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the  mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not  be permitted to engage in that activity.<br>
                We use Personally Identifiable Information to  provide products and services to you, enhance the operation of the Site,  administer contests, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Site  usage, improve our product and service offerings, and to tailor your interaction  experience. For example, if you send our customer service an email we may use  your comments and feedback to tell others about our services, and may post your  comment in our marketing materials or on our Site. In addition, if you use our Site  to send information or a product to another person, we may store your personal  information, and the personal information of any recipient. We may use that  other person’s contact information to allow him or her to view and accept your gift  or to allow the recipient to access the information you requested we send. We  may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve  disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements  with you, including our Site Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with  applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.</li>
              <li><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable  Information.</strong>&nbsp;Non-Personally  Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific End  User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource  Locator ("URL") of the website you visited before coming to our Site,  the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Site, the type of browser  you are using and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. We, and/or  our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically  collect this information when you visit our Site through the use of electronic  tools like Cookies and Web Beacons or Pixel Tags, as described in items 2 and 7  of this Privacy Policy.<br>
                We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to  troubleshoot, administer the Site, analyze trends, gather demographic  information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement  activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party  Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our  online advertising, content, and programming.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. Release of Personally Identifiable Information</strong> <br>
              Your privacy is of utmost  importance to us and we will not sell, rent, trade, license, or otherwise  disclose your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as mentioned  below: </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>We may share your information  with Authorized Third Party Service Providers.</strong>&nbsp;We may provide some of our services and products through  third parties. These "Third Party Service Providers" perform  functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing our administrative  and promotional emails, or in the case of shipping companies whereby they will  ship our products out to you. We may share your Personally Identifiable  Information with such Service Providers to send postal or email, remove  repetitive information on customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing  assistance, provide search results and links, operate the Site, troubleshoot,  and provide customer service. We may also collect personal information from  individuals and companies ("Affiliates") with whom we have business  relationships and may have to also share their information with Service  Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. We encourage Third Party  Providers to act at all times in accordance with our Privacy Policy as well as  to adopt and post privacy policies of their own.</li>
              <li><strong>We may share your information in  a Business Transfer.</strong>&nbsp;As  with any other business, we could merge with or be acquired by other entities.  If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we  maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally  Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.</li>
              <li><strong>We may share your information for  our Protection and the Protection of Others.</strong>&nbsp;We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information  when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or a court  order, enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Site Terms of Use or other  agreements, or protect the rights, property, or safety of the Site, its users  or others.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>3. Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong> <br>
              We may disclose or share  Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Partners, Affiliates and  Advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information  (which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information) with  "Third Party Advertisers" or "Third Party Advertising  Companies" and other parties as provided below:<br>
              We may use Third Party Advertising Companies to  serve advertisements when you visit our Site. These companies may use  Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits to this and other  websites in order to provide, through the use of network tags, advertisements  about goods and services that may be of interest to you.<br>
              We also use Third Party Service Providers to track  and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable Information usage and volume  statistical information from our Users to administer our Site and constantly  improve its quality. We may also publish this information for promotional  purposes or as a representative audience for Advertisers. Please note that this  is not Personally Identifiable Information, only aggregated summaries of the  activities of our users.</p>
            <p><strong>4. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</strong> <br>
              As discussed above, you can  always choose not to provide information, although it may be required to engage  in a certain activity on the Site. As a condition of purchase of our products  and services, we will send you Administrative (such as upon registration, or  service-related announcements) and Promotional emails. We will send you  information regarding your account activity and purchases as well as updates  about our products and promotional offers.<br>
              You cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails.  "Administrative Emails" relate to a user's activity on the Site, and  include emails regarding a particular user's account and requests or inquiries.  In contrast to Administrative Emails, however, you do have a choice with  respect to Promotional Emails. Promotional Emails advertise our products and  services, and/or the products and services of our Advertisers and Affiliates. If  you do not want to receive Promotional Emails from us, you may elect to opt-out  of receiving Promotional Emails at any time after registering by e-mailing us  at <strong>cs@berrybenka.com</strong>, or by clicking the  "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any of the Promotional E-mails.  When contacting us, please indicate your name and email address, and specify  which Promotional Emails you do not want to receive. Furthermore, if you wish  to disable your account and subsequently further usage of our site through that  account, you may do so by informing us at <strong>cs@berrybenka.com</strong>. It  may however be impossible for us to completely delete all of your information  because we periodically backup information.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Corrections</strong> <br>
              We believe that you should have  the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable Information you  provide us. Upon your request, we will correct any of your Personally  Identifiable Information. You can do so by sending us an email at <strong>cs@berrybenka.com</strong>. Please indicate your name and email  address, and what information you would like to correct. We encourage you to  promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes. </p>
            <p><strong>6. Security of Information</strong> <br>
              We take security seriously and  take numerous precautions to protect the security of Personally Identifiable  Information. You can access your Personally Identifiable Information on our Site  through a password and your email address. This password is encrypted. We  recommend that you do not share your password with anyone. Any Personally  Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only selected  personnel and contractors have access to. We encrypt certain sensitive  information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that your  Personally Identifiable Information is safe as it is transmitted to us.<br>
              Unfortunately, no data transmission over the  Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a  result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect  data and seek to partner with companies which do the same, we cannot guarantee  the security of any information transmitted to or from the Site, and are not  responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such  information.</p>
            <p><strong>7. Data Tracking</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Cookies.</strong>&nbsp;To facilitate and customize your experience with the Site,  we may store cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that is  stored on a User's computer for record-keeping purposes which contains  information about that User. We use cookies to save you time while using the Site,  remind us who you are, and track and target user interests in order to provide  a customized experience. Cookies also allow us to collect Non-Personally  Identifiable Information from you, like which pages you visited and what links  you clicked on. Use of this information helps us to create a more user-friendly  experience for all visitors. In addition, we may use Third Party Advertising  Companies to serve ads on our behalf. As part of their service, they may place  separate cookies on your computer. We have no access to or control over these  cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by our Site only and  does not cover the use of cookies by any third party. Most browsers  automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser settings  to decline cookies. Please note that if you decline or delete these cookies,  some parts of the Site may not work properly. </li>
              <li><strong>Other Tracking Devices.</strong>&nbsp;We may use other industry standard technologies like pixel  tags and web beacons to track your use of our Site pages and promotions, or we  may allow our Third Party Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf.  Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on  our Site, or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have  performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an  email, pixel tags and web beacons generate a Non-Personally Identifiable notice  of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve our understanding of  visitor traffic and behavior on our Site, as well as give us a way to measure  our promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and web beacons  provided by our Affiliates and/or Marketing Partners for the same purposes.</li>
              <li><strong>Log  Files. </strong>As is true of most web sites, the Site server is able to  automatically recognize the Internet URL from which you access the Site. We may  also log your Internet protocol (“IP”) address, Internet service provider, and  date/time stamp for system administration, order verification, internal  marketing, and system troubleshooting purposes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong>8. Privacy Policies of Third Party Sites</strong> <br>
              This Privacy Policy only  addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other  websites that may be accessible through this Site may have their own privacy  policies and data collection, use, and disclosure practices. If you link to any  such website, we urge you review the website's privacy policy. We are not  responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.</p>
            <p><strong>9. Miscellaneous Privacy Issues</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Age.</strong>&nbsp;We do not knowingly or intentionally collect personal  information from children under the age 13.

              <li><strong>Public Areas.</strong>&nbsp;We may provide areas on our Site where you can publicly post  information about yourself, can communicate with others, or can review products  and submit media content. This information may be accessible by third parties  and may appear on other websites or web searches, and therefore this  information could be read, collected, and used by others. We have no control  over who reads your postings or what other users may do with the information  you voluntarily post. Thus, please use caution when posting any personal  information in public areas of our Site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>10. Offline  Collection, Use, and Disclosure of Personal Information</strong> <br>
              We  may also collect your personal information offline, where we will try to  protect your privacy.
