This Privacy Policy also applies to personal information collected by third-party vendors on our behalf.</p><h3>What is Personal Information?</h3><p><b>“Personal Information”</b> is information about a particular individual that specifically identifies that individual, or information about that individual, such as name, address, email address, telephone number, or credit or debit card information. Personal Information does not include “<b>aggregate information</b>,” which is data that may be collected automatically or without reference to Personal Information about the use of the Sites. The Privacy Policy does not restrict <b>Bernie 2020</b>’s collection and use of aggregate information.</p><h3>Visitors to the Sites</h3><p>Bernie 2020 operates in the United States and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law.</p><p>Children. The Sites are not directed at children and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information directly from children (including information concerning a child or that child's parents/guardians, any screen or user name that functions as online contact information for a child, any photograph, video, or audio file containing a child’s image or voice) directly from users under the age of thirteen (13) or from other web sites or services directed at children. Consistent with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (“<b>COPPA</b>”), we will not knowingly request or collect Personal Information from any child under the age of thirteen (13) in the United States without obtaining the required consent from the appropriate parent/guardian. Children may access and browse the Sites without disclosing any Personal Information. We will apply material changes to this Privacy Policy to conform with applicable law, including any applicable provisions of COPPA that require parental consent. Please visit <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens.html" target="_blank">www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens.html</a> for information from the Federal Trade Commission about protecting children’s privacy online. If you have any reservations, questions or concerns about your child’s access to the Sites or how information that your child provides is used by us, please contact us.</p><p>International Visitors. The Sites are designed for and targeted to U.S. audiences and are governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S., including California Civil Code Section 1798.83. <b>Bernie 2020</b> makes no representation that the Sites are operated in accordance with the laws or regulations of, or governed by, other nations.</p><h3>Collection of Personal Information</h3><p>Direct Collection. We collect Personal Information that you provide to us when you register, send us an email, sign up to receive email or text messages, sign up to volunteer, fill out a form, make a purchase or donation, communicate with us through third-party social feeds, request information, participate in active forums or take any other action on the Sites. As required by the Federal Election Commission (<b>FEC</b>), we must also collect and disclose the name, address, occupation, and employer of all donors whose donations exceed $200 during the election cycle. We (or our service providers) may also obtain information from outside sources and combine it with the information we collect through the Sites, including from voter file data from state parties and other organizations, from public databases, and from private organizations.
