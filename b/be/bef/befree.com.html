<p class="subheadline">STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBLE ONLINE MARKETING</p>
<p>Be Free's information usage practices are based on two beliefs: first, that protecting user privacy is essential to the growth and prosperity of the Internet; second, that a personalized web experience can provide significant benefits to Internet users if done properly. In accordance with these beliefs, Be Free has created partner marketing programs that bring businesses and partners together in revolutionary ways without compromising individual privacy. We believe that our method of anonymous online profiling is the right way to provide a personalized web experience, and we have put in place a number of strict policies to ensure that user privacy is protected. This statement describes those policies.
</p>

<p class="subheadline">Be Free Is a Licensee of TRUSTe</p>
<p>This confirms that Be Free is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this web site has agreed to notify you of: </p>

<ul class="none">
<li>What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through the web site 
</li><li>The organization collecting the information 
</li><li>How the information is used 
</li><li>With whom the information may be shared 
</li><li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information 
</li><li>The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Be Free's control 
</li><li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information
</li></ul>

<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact <a href="MAILTO:privacy@befree.com">privacy@befree.com</a>. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe <a href="http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog_intro.html" target="_blank">http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog_intro.html</a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with Be Free to resolve your concerns. TRUSTe can only cover the activities on <a href="/">www.befree.com</a>, and is not able to cover activities outside of the Be Free web site.</p>

<p class="headline">User Privacy</p>

<p class="subheadline">Collection of Data</p>
<p><b>Be Free does not track the identity or contact information of end users</b>. Be Free's partner marketing and site marketing technologies collect and analyze anonymous Internet browsing and online purchase data to predict which promotions may be most interesting to Internet users. When an Internet user visits a web site employing Be Free's technology, Be Free sends a cookie to assign an anonymous, unique identifier to the user's Internet browser. Cookies are small data files commonly used on the Internet to help identify repeat visitors to web sites. Only Be Free has access to the anonymous identifier assigned to a user's browser. Be Free then uses Internet browsing and online purchase data associated with the anonymous identifier to develop a predictive statistical user profile of the user's needs and interests. Be Free does not collect users' names, physical addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers, social security numbers, or any other information which can be used to identify a specific person, nor does it match such information with the anonymous profiles. Be Free's technology records IP addresses, but does not associate any IP address with an organization name. </p>

<p>For improved audience targeting, Be Free's site marketing technology allows clients to add non-personally-identifying demographic information -- such as age, gender, area code, or ZIP code -- to the anonymous profile data. Be Free does not allow its clients to submit any personally identifying data to the profiles, and if any were received it would be discarded immediately. Thus, there is no direct connection between a user's online choices and his or her personal identity. </p>

<p>In the future, Be Free may allow users to volunteer personal information to be incorporated into their profiles. This option will allow users to receive even more personalized services. Such information would be incorporated strictly on an opt-in basis, and the security of such data would be maintained with strong safeguards. Personal information is not currently allowed into the profiles.</p>

<p class="subheadline">Use and Disclosure of Data</p>
<p><b>Be Free does not sell, rent, or disclose profile data to any party</b>. Be Free uses the profile data to present targeted offers or content to visitors of sites using the Be Free personalization service. Be Free only provides this information in the form of specific recommendations based on aggregate profile data. At no point in this process does Be Free give profile data to the client, nor does it provide the recommendation to the client in any form which could be combined with existing personal information that the client possesses. Be Free may also use anonymous user data to create and disclose aggregate reports which reflect the collective browsing and purchasing activities of groups of anonymous users, and if applicable to detect suspect activity. Merchant Clients may receive reports showing the aggregate number of times a particular promotion is displayed and the volume of purchases resulting from such promotions, or the browsing activity of certain demographic segments selected by a particular Merchant Client.   Be Free reserves the right to release information on end users to mandated parties if compelled to do so by proper judicial or governmental authorities. At present, all information processing occurs in the United States.</p>


<p class="subheadline">Access and Opt Out</p>
<p>Be Free empowers users to access and modify their anonymous profile data through a Profile Control Panel. This control panel can be found at <a href="http://www.yourcontrolpanel.com/mypage/pcp.html" target="_blank">http://www.yourcontrolpanel.com/mypage/pcp.html</a>. The panel displays the web site and web page information incorporated into a user's personalized recommendations. The Profile Control Panel allows users to remove individual records that they do not wish to have associated with their profile, remove all of the records in the profile, or opt out of personalization entirely. Be Free provides access to this panel on its own web site, and requires that its personalization service clients also provide clear access to the Profile Control Panel.</p>

<p class="headline">Partner Privacy</p>
<p>Because Be Free serves as the data interchange between partners and clients, it necessarily has access to a great deal of information about partners, including contact information and the performance data for their programs. To ensure the privacy of partners, Be Free maintains the following policies:
</p>
<p><b>Be Free shares neither personally identifiable information about a partner nor information about a partner's performance with any parties but the partner and the client with whom that partner has a contract</b>. While Be Free does record such information in the application process and retains it in order to serve its clients through processes such as reporting and payments to partners, this partner information is owned entirely by the partner and the client. Clients' use of partner data is governed by the clients' contracts with the partners. Partners are always free to verify, alter, or delete the information recorded about them by updating their profiles through reporting.net, Be Free's partner interface, or by contacting their marketing programs. Partners are encouraged to review all terms of the affiliation agreement before initiating the relationship.</p>

<p>In instances in which an individual has become affiliated with a Be Free client and has also visited sites employing the Be Free personalization service, Be Free could be in possession of personal information about an individual for whom it also has an anonymous user profile. Be Free stores these data sets separately, and at no point will Be Free incorporate personal information about a partner into a user profile without the explicit consent of the partner. </p>

<p class="headline">Security Measures</p>
<p>Be Free employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security of all data. Be Free data processing occurs primarily in Exodus facilities, which employ multiple safeguards to protect system data. All client and partner data is protected through case-sensitive, alphanumeric passwords. These passwords are stored on an encrypted database. Access to these passwords is limited to the clients and partners that created the accounts, and to designated Be Free employees who require system level access in order to perform their jobs. Access to anonymous user profile data is limited to designated Be Free employees who require such access in order to perform their jobs. Be Free routinely evaluates its data security practices to identify security threats or opportunities for improvement.</p>

<p class="headline">Client and Partner Web Sites</p>
<p>While Be Free encourages clients and partners to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, Be Free is not responsible for the information practices of clients or their partners. clients and partners may collect information from or about Internet users, including personal information. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by clients and partners are subject to their respective privacy policies. clients' and partners' privacy policies may differ from Be Free's policy. clients employing Be Free's site marketing services are required to provide access on their site to the Be Free hosted Profile Control Panel.</p>

<p class="headline">Be Free's Web site</p>
<p>Personal information gathered through Be Free's web site <a href="/">www.befree.com</a> is used only for the purposes expressed on the web site and is not shared with third parties. All personally identifying information gathered through the Be Free web site is provided entirely on a voluntary basis, and resulting communications continue only so long as the outside party so desires. The "Clients" contact information form and the "Stay in Touch" form allow interested parties to request more information about Be Free, and we use the contact information from those forms only to reach these interested parties. The site provides a number of e-mail addresses on the "Partners" page (Solutions Partners, Joint Marketing Partners, etc.) and on the "Contact Us" page (Sales, Careers, etc.). These e-mail addresses are provided so that visitors can send their inquiries directly to the people at Be Free best equipped to handle their questions. Be Free endeavors to respond to such inquiries as quickly as possible. The identity of the inquirers and the content of their messages are not shared with any outside parties.</p>

<p>Be Free employs cookies to observe the online behavior of anonymous visitors to <a href="/">http://www.befree.com</a>.  Be Free uses these observations to help optimize and personalize the website user experience.  Information derived from these cookies is not tied to personal information submitted on the site, nor is it shared with any third parties.  You may access the information tied to your cookie at <a href="http://www.yourcontrolpanel.com" target="_blank">www.yourcontrolpanel.com</a>. At this site you may also alter the information in your anonymous profile or opt out of personalization altogether.</p>

<p class="headline">E-mail</p>
<p><b>Be Free will never intentionally send unsolicited e-mail messages that could legitimately be construed as spam</b>. Be Free educates and encourages its clients to uphold the same standards. Be Free believes that successful online marketing is created by understanding buyers and their interests, not by using mass e-mail programs that bother large numbers of uninterested parties. Consequently, Be Free has developed the following policies against the practice of spam:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li>All e-mail sent by Be Free on behalf of our clients must have an enclosed opt-out. 
</li><li>Partner recruiting activities that include e-mail messaging must rely on opt-in methods. 
</li><li>Be Free will advise its clients that we believe spam is both inappropriate and ineffective. 
</li><li>Be Free will recommend to all of its clients that partners found to be sending spam be removed immediately from their marketing programs. 
</li><li>Recipients of Be Free's client newsletter may opt-out of that newsletter at any time by responding to the mailing. 
</li></ul>

<p>Questions or concerns regarding Be Free's policies on spam and e-mail should be sent to <a href="MAILTO:Abuse@befree.com">Abuse@befree.com</a>.</p>

<p class="headline">Changes to this statement</p>
<p>Changing business needs, technologies, and governmental requirements may make it necessary for Be Free to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any material changes will be posted prominently on this site. Except as otherwise required by law, modifications to this Privacy Policy will not affect the privacy of data collected by Be Free prior to the effective date of the policy change. </p>
