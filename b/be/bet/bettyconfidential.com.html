<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>
BettyConfidential.com is an online service that allows each of its members 
to set up a unique personal profile, which can be linked with a network of friends. 
BettyConfidential.com members can view a portion of each others' profiles and 
meet new friends using this service. To allow for new connections and friendships 
to be made, we display some personal information to other members. 
BettyConfidential.com members can change their profile information at any time and 
can control how other members and the service communicates with them.
</p><p>
BettyConfidential.com cares deeply about online privacy. If you have any 
questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at 
service@BettyConfidential.com.
</p>
<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
<p>BettyConfidential.com collects user submitted information such as name, email address, 
and age to authenticate users who enroll as members and to send notifications to those 
users relating to the BettyConfidential.com service. BettyConfidential.com also collects 
other profile data including but not limited to: personal interests, gender, age, education 
and occupation in order to assist our members in finding and communicating with each other.
BettyConfidential.com also logs non-personally-identifiable information including 
IP address, profile information, aggregate data, and browser type from members and 
visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve 
the website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with 
third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members. 
User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes only.
</p><p>
Member profile information is displayed to people in order to facilitate 
member interaction in the social networking community. Email addresses are used for 
the purposes of inviting new friends and to send notifications related to the service. 
Members communicate with each other through the BettyConfidential.com service 
without disclosing their email addresses. Members' full names are never directly 
revealed to other members.

<h3>Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members</h3>
<p>
