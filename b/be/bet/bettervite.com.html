	<br>
	<strong>Security</strong><br>
	We take numerous precautions to protect the security of Personally Identifiable Information. Your Personally Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have access to. In addition, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in the transmission of any sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your Personally Identifiable Information.<br>
	Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies that do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Site, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><br>
	We may update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting amended terms on this Site. If you are a registered Bettervite user or have provided your email address to receive email notifications, we additionally will notify you of significant changes via the email address you provided or have associated with your account, so you must ensure that our email is not filtered from your Inbox by your ISP or email software. You agree that your use of Bettervite Site, after the date on which the Privacy Policy is changed, will constitute your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy, and that you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Unless stated otherwise, our updated Privacy Policy shall apply to all information that we have about you and your account.<br>
