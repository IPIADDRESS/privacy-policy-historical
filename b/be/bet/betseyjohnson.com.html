              <p>Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy 
                Policy apply only to information gathered through this Web site 
                and, where applicable, through our <strong><a href="/store/os/feedback.aspx">Customer

              <p>We collect and store information that you enter into this Web site 
                or that you provide to our Customer Service Department. For example, 
                when you open an account or place an order, we collect and store 
                some or all of the following information that you provide: name, 
                billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number, 
                credit card number and expiration date. This information is used 
                to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, 
                to process and ship orders, to send order and shipping confirmations 
                and to provide customer service. This information also may be used 
                to contact you about sales, special offers and new site features, 
                unless you have opted not to receive promotional communications 
                in connection with this Web site. </p>
              <p>We collect and store certain other information automatically whenever 
                you interact with this Web site. For example, we collect your IP 
                address, browser information and reference site domain name every 
                time you visit this Web site. We also collect information regarding 
                customer traffic patterns and site usage. This information is used 
                to analyze and improve this Web site and to provide our customers 
                with a fulfilling shopping experience.</p>
              <p>Also, like many Web sites, we use "cookies", which are 
                files stored on your computer's hard drive by your browser. Cookies 
                do not contain personally identifiable information. Cookies help 
                us to identify account holders and to optimize their shopping experience. 
                Cookies also allow us to hold selections in a shopping cart when 
                a user leaves this Web site without checking out. Cookies are not 
                used on this Web site to store your account information; this information 
                is stored securely on this Web site's server. When you log in at 
                this Web site with your username and password, we will assign you 
                a secure session id. The server then passes your information to 
                you through this secure session id. Also, we will use cookies to 
                monitor and maintain information about your use of this Web site. 
                Cookies are also used to track the identity of the Web site you 
                visited immediately prior to visiting this Web site; otherwise, 
                we do not track information about your use of other Web sites. Most 
                browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. 
                We recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that 
                we can offer you a better shopping experience on this Web site.</p>
              <p>We also may collect and store information about you that we receive 
                from other sources, to enable us to update and correct the information 
                contained in our database and to provide product recommendations 
                and special offers that we think will interest you. <br>

              <p>We do not sell or ship any items ordered through this Web site 
                directly to anyone who we know to be under the age of 18, nor do 
                we collect any personal information from anyone who we know to be 
                under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you should 
                use this Web site only with the involvement of a parent or guardian 
                and should not submit any personal information to us. <br>

                            <span>With Whom Do You Share Your Information?</span></strong></p>
              <p>We do not share with others, or sell or rent to others, any personal 
                information that you provide to us through this Web site or through 
                our Customer Service Department, except with your consent or as 
                described in this Privacy Policy. <br>
                We engage third parties to perform services in connection with the 
                operation of our business. Examples of these services include payment 
                processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, 
                product customization, order fulfillment and shipping, marketing 
                and promotional material distribution, Web site evaluation, data 
                analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing. We provide personal 
                information to these third parties, but we authorize them to use 
                this information only in connection with the services they perform. </p>
              <p>We may release personal information if we believe in good faith 
                that: the law or legal process requires it; we have received a valid 
                administrative request from a law enforcement agency; or such release 
                is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Onestop 
                and/or Betseyjohnson.com, or any of our respective affiliates, business partners, 
                customers or others. </p>
              <p>We may share non-personal information with our marketing partners, 
                advertisers and others from time to time. Examples of such non-personal 
                information include the number of users who visited this Web site 
                during a specific time period or purchased a specific product through 
                this Web site. This information generally is shared in an aggregated 
                form. </p>
              <p>As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, 
                we might sell or buy online stores or other assets. In such transactions, 
                information about customers often is among the transferred assets. 
                Accordingly, in the unlikely event that Onestop or Betseyjohnson.com, or 
                substantially all of our respective assets, are acquired by a third 
                party, such information may be one of the transferred assets (unless 
                the information was collected under a previous Privacy Policy that 
                did not permit such disclosure). Under such circumstances, Onestop 
                or Betseyjohnson.com, as the case may be, would to the extent possible require 
                the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy 
                Policy.<br>
                            <br>
                            <span><strong>What Steps Are Taken To Keep My Information Secure?</strong></span></p>
              <p>We use various security measures, including Secure Socket Layer 
                (SSL) encryption technology, to protect personal information that 
                we collect. If you place an order through this Web site, you will 
                be asked to set up an account and provide an email address and password. 
                You must provide an appropriate email address and password in order 
                to access account information. In order to help protect your personal 
                information further, you should be careful about providing your 
                password to others. If you wish to cancel a password, or if you 
                become aware of any loss, theft or unauthorized use of a password,
