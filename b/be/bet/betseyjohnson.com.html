<p>BetseyJohnson.com (formerly operated by Betsey Johnson, LLC and now operated by a subsidiary of Steven Madden, Ltd.) respects your privacy. Consistent with our commitment to providing you with a satisfying and helpful shopping experience, we have found that collecting Personal Information (defined below) helps us to better understand the products and services most helpful to you.</p>

<p>This notice to you regarding our Privacy Policy describes the types of Personal Information we collect, how we use the information, with whom we share the information and the choices you can make about our collection, use and disclosure of the information; we also describe the measures that we take to protect the security of the information and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.  We may change or add to this Privacy Policy at any time without notice, so we encourage you to review it periodically. We reserve the right to vary this policy state by state as required by law. By purchasing our products on BetseyJohnson.com or using our services or our Site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with the following Privacy Policy. Please read this information carefully.  If at any time you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use this Site and refrain from purchasing from us.</p>

<p>Our products are available for sale in many department and specialty stores, as well as on other Sites. Personal information collected in these other channels is not provided to us. This notice does not address the information practices of department or specialty stores or other Sites in which our products are sold. Department and specialty stores, as well as other Sites may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review when you provide them with your personal information. We are not responsible for the personal information practices of department and specialty stores or other Sites.</p>

<h2>Use of Information Collected by Us</h2> 

<p>We may collect two types of information from you when you purchase products and gift cards: (1) "Personal Information" (such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and payment card information) and (2) "Aggregate Information" (such as information about how many users log on to our Site on a daily basis).</p>

<p>We use customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, promotions and contests. We may also use this information to make offers to you, to help us target specific products and services to you, and to help us develop and improve our Site and tailor our Site to your interests.</p>

<h2>Order-related and Promotional Surveys, Sweepstakes, Electronic Newsletters, Mobile Marketing, Blogs, Customer Reviews and Email to a Friend </h2>

We use this information to process your transaction.</li>
	<li>When you buy products or obtain services, we may ask you to complete a customer satisfaction survey. If you choose to do so, you may provide information such as your name, email address, telephone number, age, gender and other demographic information, in addition to your comments. Providing any of this information is optional. We use the information you provide to improve our products and services, and enhance your shopping experience.</li>
	<li>You may call our customer service line for information about our products or personal shopping advice.

<p>We do not sell or otherwise disclose Personal Information or Aggregate Information about our customers, except as described herein. We may share the personal information you provide to us with our affiliates, licensees and joint venture partners for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice.

<p>We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the personal information you provide on this Site or in our Stores against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use and other unlawful forms of processing. We use Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology to protect the transmission over the Internet of your payment card data. You can check the security of your connection by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure site, the first characters of the site address change from "http" to "https."

Please include your name, email address and postal address in your request. We will endeavor to comply with your requests as soon as reasonably practicable.

<h2>Your Choices</h2>

<p>We offer you certain choices about how we communicate with you and what information we collect from you. You may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us or object at any time on legitimate grounds and free of charge to the processing of your personal information, and we will apply your preferences going forward.</p>

<p>You can choose not to receive marketing communications from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link in our marketing emails, or contacting us as specified in the "Customer Support-FAQs" section on this Site. Please include your name, email address and postal address if you send us your request by email or postal mail.</p>

<p>If you are a California resident, you may ask us to refrain from sharing your information with certain of our affiliates and other third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>

<h2>Updates to Our Privacy Notice</h2>

<p>This Privacy Notice may be updated periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our personal information practices or relevant laws. We will post a prominent notice on the Site to notify you of any significant changes to our Privacy Notice and indicate at the top of the notice when it was updated.</p>

<h2>Children and Privacy</h2>

<p>BetseyJohnson.com is concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet, and understands that children may not understand all the provisions of our Privacy Policy or make informed decisions about the choices that are made available to adult users of the Site. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be familiar with the Sites their children visit.</p>

<p>Our Site and affiliate Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we will never request personally identifiable information from anyone whom we know to be under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a customer is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our files. </p>

<h2>Additional Information</h2>

<p>No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of BetseyJohnson.com to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, neither BetseyJohnson.com nor any of our service providers can ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.</p>

<h2>Your California Privacy Rights</h2>

<p>If you are a resident of California, you may make a written request to us about how we have shared your personal customer information with select third parties for their direct marketing purposes. In response to your written request, we will identify the categories of information shared and will include a list of the third parties and affiliates with which it was shared, along with their names and address.

<h2>International </h2>

<p>If you are visiting the Site from a location outside of the United States, your connection will be through and to servers located in the United States, your orders placed through the Site will be fully processed in and shipped from the United States and all information you provide will be processed and securely maintained in our web servers and internal systems located within the United States. IN ADDITION, IF YOU ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, THE LAWS OF WHICH MAY BE DEEMED BY OTHER COUNTRIES TO HAVE INADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION. Users of the Site located in countries outside of the United States of America who submit personal information do thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of that information to and/or storage of the information in the United States of America. This policy and our legal obligations are subject to the laws of the State of New York and the United States of America, regardless of the location of any user.

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>IN NO EVENT SHALL BETSEYJOHNSON.COM OR ANY AFFILIATED ENTITIES OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF THESE ENTITIES HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION, UNDER CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE, INABILITY TO USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE INFORMATION, SERVICES, PRODUCTS AND MATERIALS AVAILABLE FROM THE SITE. These limitations shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose or the existence of any limited remedy. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>

<h2>Applicable Law</h2>

<p>These terms relating to privacy will be governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of the State of New York, notwithstanding any conflicts of law. You specifically consent to personal jurisdiction in New York in connection with any dispute between you and us.

If any part of these Terms of Use is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining provisions. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement relating to this subject matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any additional terms and conditions on this Site will govern the items to which they apply. We may revise this Privacy Policy at any time.</p>

					Betsey Johnson LLC, which previously operated the BetseyJohnson.com e-commerce website 
					selling Betsey Johnson merchandise under a license from Steven Madden, Ltd., 
					filed for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on April 26, 2012.  
					Betsey Johnson LLC and Steven Madden, Ltd. are two separate and distinct unaffiliated legal entities 
					and Steven Madden, Ltd. bears no responsibility for the liabilities of Betsey Johnson LLC.
				</p>
				<p>
					In connection with the bankruptcy, the license provided by Steven Madden, Ltd. to Betsey Johnson LLC was terminated and, 
					as of July 23, 2012, Steven Madden, Ltd., through one of its subsidiaries, will operate the BetseyJohnson.com 
					e-commerce website.  We are now engaged in upgrading the BetseyJohnson.com website and cannot accept new orders 
					at this time.  We expect that the new BetseyJohnson.com e-commerce website will be fully operational in Fall 2012 
					and we will be ready to take orders for your favorite Betsey Johnson brand clothing, footwear and accessories at that time. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As indicated above, Betsey Johnson LLC and Steven Madden, Ltd. are two separate and distinct unaffiliated legal entities 
					and, as such, if you placed an order through the old BetseyJohnson.com website prior to July 23, 2012, Steven Madden, Ltd. 
					cannot help you with locating, returning or exchanging that merchandise.
