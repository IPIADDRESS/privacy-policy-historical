                    our customers about our products, services, contests and promotions. 
                    We recognize that we must maintain and use customer information 
                    responsibly. We do not sell or rent the information you provide

                    policy changes on our website or by communicating directly 
                    with you. At that time, you will have the opportunity to opt 
                    out of any new use of your information.<br>

                    use information about your product interests and purchases 
                    to help us improve our site design and your shopping experience.

                    To serve you better, we may combine information you give us 
                    online about your product interest and purchases with demographic

                  <p>We contract with third parties to assist us in maintaining 
                    and managing our customer information, to fulfill promotions 
                    and to communicate with our customers. We do not authorize

                    <br>
                    When we offer contests and promotions, or join with other 
                    companies to do so, customers who choose to participate in 
                    those contests and promotions may be asked to provide personal 
                    information to participate. That information may then be used 
                    by us and by any company offering the contest or promotion 
                    to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations. <br>
                    <br>
                    In addition, when we team up with another company to offer 
                    or provide products, services, contests or promotions, we 
                    and the other company may cross-reference our customer databases 
                    to identify common customers. We and the other company may 
                    use that existing information to identify future promotional 
                    opportunities and to fulfill promotional or contractual obligations.

                    <br>
                    If, prior to participating in a contest or promotion, you
                     opted not to receive information about or mailings from
                    us, 
                    you may still receive information from or about betseyjohnson.com
                     in connection with the contest or promotion if you choose
                    
                    to register for or participate in it. You may opt not to
                    participate  in these contests or promotions if you do not
                    want to receive 
                    information about betseyjohnson.com or share your information
                     with betseyjohnson.com and the other companies sponsoring
                    
                    those contests or promotions. </p>
                  <p>If you are a catalog customer,
                      we may share your name and  mailing address with third
                    parties that have products or services
                      we think may interest you. We also may share aggregate,

                      and 
                      types of products purchased, with our business partners
                    to fulfill our contractual obligations. Except as described

                  <p>Like you, we at betseyjohnson.com are concerned about the 
                    safety of children when they use the Internet. Consistent 
                    with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, 
                    we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information 
                    from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental 
                    consent. If we receive actual knowledge that a subscriber 
                    to betseyjohnson.com is under the age of 13, we will remove 
                    all personally identifiable information about that person 
                    from our files. <br>

                    use cookies on its site?</strong></span></p>
                  <p>A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on 
                    your computer's hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie 
                    may contain information, such as a unique user ID that websites 
                    use to track the pages of the sites you've visited. We use 
                    cookies but do not store personally identifiable information 
                    in your cookie. <br>
                    <br>
                    We use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. 
                    Cookies enable us to keep track of your order as you shop 
                    on our site. Through our use of cookies, we also track and 
                    maintain the identity of the web site you visited immediately 
                    prior to visiting our website. We do not otherwise track any 
                    information about your use of other websites. <br>
                    <br>
                    You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. 
                    If you turn off cookies, though, we will not be able to track 
                    your order to enable you to purchase from our site. To override 
                    your current cookie handling practices for individual sites: 
                    Select “Internet Options” from the “Tools” 
                    Menu. Click on the “Edit” button in the “Override 
                    cookie handling for individual websites” section. This 
                    will open the “Per Site Privacy Actions” dialogue 
                    box. Type “www.betseyjohnson.com” in the “Address

                    Click the “OK” button, then close the “Per

                    <br>
                    <span><strong>How do I know my order information is secure?</strong></span></p>
                  <p>Protecting your order information is important to us. To 
                    check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand 
                    corner of your browser window after accessing the server. 
                    If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on 
                    your browser), your connection is secure. You can also double-check 
                    by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing 
                    a secure server, the first characters of the site address 
                    will change from "http" to "https." <br>
                    <br>
                    Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit 
                    communication through secure servers like the ones we use 
                    to process orders at betseyjohnson.com. In that case, you'll 
                    be unable to connect to the server, which means you won't 
                    be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured 
                    connection.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span><strong>What about links to other websites and services? 
                    </strong></span></p>
                  <p>The betseyjohnson.com website may contain links to other 
                    sites that are not under our control. These websites have 
                    their own policies regarding privacy. You should review those 
                    policies before visiting the websites. We have no responsibility 
                    for linked websites, and we provide these links solely for
