For Sit & Go’s and Tournaments the rake is the number to the right of the buy-in of the game (e.g. 10+1, where 1 is the rake). For Cash games such as Hold’em Joker there is a 5% rake being taken from the pot if the hand reaches the flop or further. Max cap for 2 players is €1(blind table 0.25\u002F0.5 cap €0.5), 3-4 players €2 (blind table 0.25\u002F0.5 cap €1), 5-10 players €3 (blind table 0.25\u002F0.5 cap €1.5). For 21 Heads Up, the rake being taken from the pot is 3% from blind levels up to €1 and 2% for blinds level higher than that. 21 Hold’em has the same rake as 21 Heads Up, except there is a cap at €1 on all the different blind levels since the pots tend to get higher as a result of the bets being Linear."}]},{"identifier":"footer-social-icons","items":[{"identifier":"social-icon-instagram","action":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.instagram.com\u002Fbethardofficial\u002F","cta":"instagram"},{"identifier":"social-icon-facebook","action":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002FBethardOfficial\u002F","cta":"facebook-square"},{"identifier":"social-icon-twitter","action":"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FBethardOfficial","cta":"twitter-square"},{"identifier":"social-icon-youtube","action":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fchannel\u002FUCvv3HwkoTaly4o1FzeGP8Lw","cta":"youtube-square"}]},{"identifier":"responsible-gaming-short","items":[{"identifier":"responsible-gaming-deposit-short","content":"Set your own deposit limits for how much you would like to deposit to your Bethard player account during a set period of time.

For Sit & Go’s and Tournaments the rake is the number to the right of the buy-in of the game (e.g. 10+1, where 1 is the rake). For Cash games such as Hold’em Joker there is a 5% rake being taken from the pot if the hand reaches the flop or further. Max cap for 2 players is €1(blind table 0.25\u002F0.5 cap €0.5), 3-4 players €2 (blind table 0.25\u002F0.5 cap €1), 5-10 players €3 (blind table 0.25\u002F0.5 cap €1.5). For 21 Heads Up, the rake being taken from the pot is 3% from blind levels up to €1 and 2% for blinds level higher than that. 21 Hold’em has the same rake as 21 Heads Up, except there is a cap at €1 on all the different blind levels since the pots tend to get higher as a result of the bets being Linear."}]},{"identifier":"footer-social-icons","items":[{"identifier":"social-icon-instagram","action":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.instagram.com\u002Fbethardofficial\u002F","cta":"instagram"},{"identifier":"social-icon-facebook","action":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002FBethardOfficial\u002F","cta":"facebook-square"},{"identifier":"social-icon-twitter","action":"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FBethardOfficial","cta":"twitter-square"},{"identifier":"social-icon-youtube","action":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fchannel\u002FUCvv3HwkoTaly4o1FzeGP8Lw","cta":"youtube-square"}]},{"identifier":"responsible-gaming-short","items":[{"identifier":"responsible-gaming-deposit-short","content":"Set your own deposit limits for how much you would like to deposit to your Bethard player account during a set period of time.
