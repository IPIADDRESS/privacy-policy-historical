Accordingly, in this policy document (the "Privacy Policy"), Betfair wants not only to advise you of your privacy rights but also explain how we intend to respect them.</p>
					<p>Any reference to "Betfair" or the "Group" within this Privacy Policy includes Betfair Group Plc and all or any of its direct or indirect subsidiary undertakings, joint venture partners, and their related companies wherever located in the world as may exist from time to time.</p>
