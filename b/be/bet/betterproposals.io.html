<span class="legal-text-title">3. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span><br><br>
3.1 In the course of business it is necessary for us to collect Personal Information.

<span class="legal-text-title">4. HOW INFORMATION IS COLLECTED</span><br><br>
4.1 Most information will be collected in association with an individual’s use of Better Proposals, an enquiry about Better Proposals, or generally dealing with us. However we may also receive Personal Information from sources such as advertising, an individual’s own promotions, public records, mailing lists, contractors, staff, recruitment agencies and our business partners. In particular, information is likely to be collected as follows: Registrations/Subscriptions. When an individual registers or subscribes for a service, list, account, connection or other process whereby they enter Personal Information details in order to receive or access something, including a transaction; Accounts/Memberships. When an individual submits their details to open an account and/or become a member with us; Supply. When an individual supplies us with goods or services; Contact. When an individual contacts us in any way; Access. When an individual accesses us physically we may require them to provide us with details for us to permit them such access. When an individual accesses us through the internet we may collect information using cookies (if relevant – an individual can adjust their browser’s setting to accept or reject cookies) or analytical services; and/or Pixel Tags. Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read and they tell us whether mail has been opened.<br><br>
4.2 As there are many circumstances in which we may collect information both electronically and physically, we will endeavour to ensure that an individual is always aware of when their Personal Information is being collected.<br><br>
4.3 Where we obtain Personal Information without an individual’s knowledge (such as by accidental acquisition from a client) we will either delete/destroy the information, or inform the individual that we hold such information, in accordance with the UK Privacy Principles.
