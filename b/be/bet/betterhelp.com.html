We are not responsible for removing information from the third parties that we have already legitimately shared Personal Information about you.</p> </li> <li> <u>Security</u> <p>We are concerned about safeguarding your information. The security of your Personal Information is very important to us. Therefore, we employ measures to protect this information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.
