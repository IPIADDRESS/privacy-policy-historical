          how will it be used?</b><br>
          In order to give you the best experience on our site, ZeniMax may collect 
          information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. 
          Typically, we may ask a user to submit personal and/or demographic information, 
          and it will usually take the form of either: <a href="#a">(1) product 
          and warranty registration</a>; <a href="#b">(2) community forum registration</a>; 
          <a href="#c">(3) contests and sweepstakes</a>, <a href="#d">(4) technical 
          support</a>; (5) the purchase of a product or service at our <a href="#e">online 
          store</a>; and (6) personal information submitted in a <a href="#f">business 
          capacity</a> (e.g., resumes). The types of information that may be requested 
          for each activity and the way the information may be used are detailed 
          below. In the event that demographic information is requested on the 
          same page as personal information, the demographic and personal information 
          may be combined.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><u><a name="a"></a>Product and Warranty Registration</u> 
            <p><br>
              To register on our site, we may ask you to provide personal information 
              such as your name, email address, home address, and telephone number. 
              We may also collect demographic information including your age, 
              information about the product you purchased, the type of console 
              you own, and the types of games you enjoy playing. The information 
              that you submit during registration will entitle you to limited 
              warranty protection and technical support. We may also use your 
              registration information to notify you about updates to our products 
              and services.</p>
          </li>
          <li><u><a name="b"></a>Forum Registration</u> 
            <p>To register for membership in any of our online community forums, 
              we may ask you to provide personal information such as your email 
              address, and to create a username and password. We may also collect 
              demographic information about you, including your occupation, hobbies 
              and interest, and other preferences. The information that you submit 
              to us for this purpose is used to give you access to our community 
              forums and other community features and to allow the moderators 
              and administrators of the message board to contact you.</p>
