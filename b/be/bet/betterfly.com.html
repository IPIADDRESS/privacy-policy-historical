  <h1>Service Scout, Inc. dba TakeLessons Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h5 class="Plain">Last revised: August 2013</h5>
</header>

<section class="ContentSpacer50">
  <p>
    Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience
    with us as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use
    TakeLessons.com (the “Website”) and all of our services with complete
    confidence. We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our
    commitment to privacy and security and supplement our
    <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.
  </p>

  <p>We request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>

  <hr class="BreakFirst BreakLast">

  <section>
    <header class="PageDesc">
      <h3>Personal Information We Collect and How It Is Used</h3>
    </header>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>
     This Privacy Policy describes how we collect information from users of
     our Website, those who use our products and services (the “Services”) but
     do not have accounts ("Visitors"), and those who register and subscribe
     to our services ("Members"). It describes what we do with the information
     we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the
     collection and use of such information.
    </p>

    <h4>Types of Information We Collect</h4>
    <p>
      We collect information from Visitors and Members who access various
      parts of our Website and use different Services in a variety of ways,
      including through a mobile device. As a result, the type of information
      we collect depends on the ways Visitors and Members interact with us,
      our Website and/or our Service(s). We may offer websites, services or
      applications that permit browsing and do not require registration. We
      may also offer Members the ability to access their accounts online and
      offline, which may result in collection of different data.
    </p>

    <p>
      Information that we may collect about you through interactions includes
      information that you give us (such as your name, address, email
      address, other contact information, surveys and other information input
      into the Website); automatic information (data resulting from your
      activity, such as transaction information, IP address, log in, email,
      passwords and browsing activity); mobile information (location
      services); and information from other sources. We may also gather
      additional information such as the type of device and browser you are
      using, the IP address of your device, information about your device's
      operating system, and additional information associated with your
      device and browsing activity. We may also gather information collected
      through cookies, tags, and other technologies, as described further
      below.
    </p>

    <h4>Use of Registration and Visitor Information</h4>
    <p>
      Members are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign
      up for our Services including name, address, telephone number, email
      address and billing information (such as a credit card number and
      expiration date). The personal information collected from Members during
      the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such
      as for billing purposes) <strong>and may be shared with other members to
      coordinate service delivery</strong>. This information is not normally
      shared with unaffiliated third parties, unless specifically stated
      otherwise or in special circumstances.
    </p>

    <p>
      We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our
      behalf. They have access to personal information gathered through the
      Services needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
      purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may promote the Website, Services or a new service to members. You
      may manage your communication preferences within your account.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from
      personal information Members provide during registration (such as the
      total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more
      detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying
      information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.
    </p>

    <h4>Email Marketing from Third Party Sponsors</h4>
    <p>
      We may send, on behalf of third parties, promotions via mail to some or
      all of our Members. However, in no event do we sell or otherwise
      transfer to third parties the email addresses of our subscribers. We
      strictly maintain the confidentiality of our subscribers' email
      addresses, except as stated in this Privacy Policy. In addition, users
      are always given the opportunity of opting-out of these promotions.
    </p>

    <h4>Voluntary Customer Surveys</h4>
    <p>
      We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer
      surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys
      because they provide us with important information that helps us to
      improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you.
      Your personal information and responses will remain strictly
      confidential (except where required by law), even if a third party
      conducts the survey. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.
    </p>

    <p>
      We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our
      Customer Surveys and aggregate it with the responses from other
      customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions
      (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment,
      industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the
      aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you,
      and to develop new services and products. This aggregated,
      non-personally-identifying information may be shared with third parties.
    </p>

    <h4>"Cookies" and How We Use Them</h4>
    <p>
      A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive
      when you visit certain websites. We may use cookies to collect, store,
      and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the
      products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications
      networks. If you are a Member, we will use a cookie to save your
      settings (which saves you time) and to provide customizable and
      personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to
      access any of your customer information. Advertisers and partners may
      also use their own cookies. We do not control the use of these cookies
      and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through
      them. We may also provide certain widgets or tools on our sites, such as
      tools that allow web surfers to easily share information on another
      platform, such as a social media platform. At other times, information
      from a third party may be embedded on our site, such as a map or
      information streaming from another site, including communications
      streaming from a third party social media platform. These widgets,
      tools, and informational items often function through the use of third
      party cookies utilized by the third party site, such as the social
      media platform. You may wish to review information at third party
      sites, such as social media platforms where you have an account, to
      determine how these third parties treat data that they obtain through
      the use of cookies.
    </p>

    <h4>Additional Technologies</h4>
    <p>
      We may also use additional technologies such as pixel tags, web
      beacons, and clear GIFs, and may permit our third party service
      providers to use these technologies. We use these technologies for
      purposes such as measuring the effectiveness of our advertisements or
      other communications, determining viewing and response rates, and
      determining which offers to present to you on our own or on third party
      sites.
    </p>

    <h4>In the Event of a Change in Ownership</h4>
    <p>
      As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy websites,
      subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer
      information generally is one of the transferred business assets but
      remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice
      (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).
    </p>

    <p>
      In the event of a change in ownership, or a merger or an acquisition,
      all (or select aspects) of our customer information may be transferred.
      All of our subscribers and registered users will be notified of any
      change in ownership, merger or an acquisition of our assets by a third
      party. Subscribers and users may choose to access and modify any of
      their registration and subscription information at that time.
    </p>

    <h4>Special Cases</h4>
    <p>
      It is our policy not to use or share personal information about
      Visitors or Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above
      without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise
      prohibit such unrelated uses. However, we may disclose personal
      information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your
      use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for
      any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable
      to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic
      Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal
      requests for such information; to disclose information that is
      necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone
      who may be violating our
      <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> or other policies; to
      operate the Services properly; or to protect us and our Members. This
      includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations
      for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

      <h3>Credit Card Information</h3>
    </header>
    <h4>Your Credit Card Information is Secure</h4>
    <p>
      We are committed to handling your customer information with high
      standards of information security. Your credit card information is
      stored only in encrypted form and processed using a secured order
      server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. We restrict access
      to your personally identifiable information only to employees with
      proper clearance who need to know that information in order to provide
      products or services to you. While we make every effort to ensure the
      integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee
      that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from
      illegally obtaining this information.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you to prefer to place your order by telephone, you can call us
      during normal business hours at
      619-858-2200 with your credit card
      and billing information.
    </p>

    <h4>What is your Credit Card Fraud Policy?</h4>
    <p>
      In the unlikely event that you experience unauthorized use of your
      credit card, promptly report the fraudulent activity to your credit
      card company. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, you are only liable
      for the first $50 of the fraudulent charges. Please check with your
      credit card company to verify specific terms and conditions.

      <h3>Communication to Members and Visitors</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      We use personal information to communicate important information with
      our Members. Important information includes, but not limited to,
      student newsletters, instructor newsletters, lesson reminders, lesson
      comments, payment information, credit card update notifications,
      account status, legal updates, and other important account
      information. Members and, where applicable Visitors, agree to accept
      this communication from us.
    </p>

    <h4>Online Advertisements</h4>
    <p>
      We occasionally display online advertisements on our Website and in
      our newsletters and alerts. We share aggregated and non-identifying
      information about our Visitors and Members collected through the
      registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions
      with these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we use this
      aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored
      advertisements. For instance, an advertiser might tell us the
      audience they want to reach (for example, males between 25 and 55
      years of age) and provide us with an advertisement tailored to that
      audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we
      have collected, we may then display the advertisement to the intended
      audience. However, we do not share personal information about Visitors
      or Members with these advertisers to be used for other purposes.
