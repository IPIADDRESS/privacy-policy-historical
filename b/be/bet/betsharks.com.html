<ul style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 25px">
<li><strong>Information Collected</strong></li>
<p>We consider information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, first and last name, credit card information, home or other physical address, email address, phone number or other contact information to be "Personal Information."

The Personal Information that we collect may include: contact information, shipping information, billing information, transaction history, web site usage preferences, and feedback regarding our products and services. In addition, when you interact with the Service, our servers keep an activity log unique to you that collects the information including: source IP address, time of access, date of access, web page(s) visited, language use, and type of browser used.

We do not collect Personal Information about you on the Service unless you voluntarily provide it to us.</p>
<li><strong>Means of Collecting &amp; Processing Data</strong></li>
<p>We may automatically collect certain data as discussed above and receive Personal Information about you where you provide such information through the Service or other communications and interactions with BetSharks.com. We may also receive Personal Information from online vendors and service providers that refer you to the BetSharks.com website. In addition, we may engage the services of third-party service providers to provide technical support, process your online transactions and maintain your online accounts. We will have access to any information you provide to such vendors, service providers and third-party e-commerce services so that we can process your transactions, maintain your accounts, meet certain business requirements and provide you with promotional offers and information regarding BetSharks.com and our products and services. We use this Personal Information to process your transactions and support your use of the Service. Subject to clauses 3 &amp; 4 below.

Your Personal Information may also be shared with our affiliates, subsidiaries or agents for technical support and to process transactions you initiate on the Service and deliver the products and services you purchase. From time-to-time, we may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and, therefore, you have the choice of whether or not to disclose such information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). By accepting any contest prize or winnings from us, you consent to use of your name and likeness for advertising and promotional purposes without additional compensation, except where prohibited by law. Unless you have elected not to receive promotional information, we may also use your Personal Information (including your email address) to provide you with information regarding our products, services and promotions.

<li><strong>Certain Excluded Disclosures</strong></li>
<p>We may disclose your Personal Information as set out in our Terms and Conditions of Use (of the BetSharks.com website), if requested to do so by legal authorities or required to do so by law, or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to applicable laws or to comply with any legal process served on us, the BetSharks.com website or the Service; (2) protect and defend our rights or property; or (3) act to protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public.

By installing our software and using the Service, you consent to our software performing the functions described in this section. Our software may perform any or all of the following functions in order to detect the use of illicit automated programs and ensure that we maintain a "cheat free" environment for all users: <br>(1) scan your list of active software applications while you are using the Service,<br> (2) scan your list of active processes while you are using the Service,<br> (3) scan the files in your BetSharks.com-related program folders to ensure that only "non-hacked" versions of our software are being used.

<ul style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 25px">
<li> Scan the files associated with the suspect application or process and compile a composite mesh (i.e. a profile that characterizes the files associated with the application or process) to be matched against profiles for known illicit automated programs, and </li>
<li> Capture a screenshot of your desktop, and transmit these to BetSharks.com for review. Our software will not perform any random search of large portions of your hard drive or other files, and will not transmit any information to us or to any third party other than the information necessary to identify use of illicit automated program as described above. Our software will not alter any files or information on your computer, and will not interfere with the operation of any of your applications.

    <strong>Credit Card Usage Policy </strong></p>
<ol type="1" start="1" style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 25px">
<li>All credit card transactions are charged in US dollars.</li>
<li>All players using a credit card to deposit at BetSharks.com agree to complete any reasonable verification requirements to prove that they are the authorized cardholder.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a verification procedure, some BetSharks.com credit card deposits may actually be charged to your card as a random amount below the actual value of your deposit. We may then ask you to provide us with this random amount (in $US) to verify the amount of the transaction, proving that you have access to the credit card statement and are most likely the authorized card owner. For example if a player submits a $100 deposit, we may actually charge the credit card $99.86, but deposit $100 to the player's BetSharks.com account. We will then ask the player exactly how much was charged to the card, and if they look at their statement they should be able to tell us the correct answer of $99.86.</p>
<ol type="1" start="3" style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 25px">
<li>Some credit card deposits may not be charged to your card immediately. As a fraud protection measure, in certain circumstances we will only pre-authorize a charge to your card and then the settle the transaction when we are satisfied that it is a legitimate charge. Many banks also have processing delays, especially if a charge is submitted on a weekend. It is not unusual to see delays of up to 5-10 days between when you submit a transaction to your BetSharks.com account and the charge actually appears on your credit card statement.</li>
<li>Players are emailed a transaction receipt for every credit card deposit made at BetSharks.com. Please keep a copy of these transaction receipts for your records.</li>
<li>Details of your BetSharks.com credit card transactions are displayed in the history tab of the cashier within the BetSharks.com software, and are also displayed on the player ledger page of the player admin.</li>
<li>BetSharks.com uses various billing companies and merchant accounts to process credit card transactions. These merchants do not take nor accept any responsibility if the cardholder is not satisfied with the services offered by BetSharks.com. Some of these companies are listed below for player reference.<br>

<p>Players who make a deposit to a BetSharks.com account are under no obligation to make a purchase or play any games. You may request a refund at any time by sending an email to  <u>support@betsharks.com</u>.      Where possible will cancel the transaction or refund directly to the credit card used to make the account deposit, but in some cases we may not be able to do this due to credit card processing regulations. In the event that we are not able to cancel a transaction or refund directly to a credit card, a refund sent directly to a nominated bank account. Some verification from the cardholder may be required in the event that we are not able to refund directly to a card.</p></li>
<li>If you should have any queries related to a credit card transaction, please contact us. Most issues and questions regarding the use of credit cards, often arise due to a player's lack of knowledge of transaction processing procedures. We will always help wherever possible.</li>
<li>Remember that credit card fraud is not a game. If you dispute valid transactions at BetSharks.com we will track you down, prosecute you and recover all debts in full along with related fines and fees. It is against the law to dispute valid transactions and even if your bank allows you to reverse a transaction it does not mean you are legally authorized to do so.</li>
