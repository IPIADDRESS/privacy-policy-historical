<li><strong>Consent to Use of Anti-Cheating Software</strong></li></ol><br>
<p>Our software package used to access and use the BETSHARKS.com service ("Service") contains certain features designed to detect use of automated programs that enable artificial (non-human) intelligence to play on our site. Use of such "bot" software programs violates our Terms and Conditions of Use, and is detrimental to other players. By installing our software and using the Service, you consent to our software performing the functions described in this section. Our software may perform any or all of the following functions in order to detect the use of illicit automated programs and ensure that we maintain a "cheat free" environment for all users: (1) scan your list of active software applications while you are using the Service, (2) scan your list of active processes while you are using the Service, (3) scan the files in your BETSHARKS.com-related program folders to ensure that only "non-hacked" versions of our software are being used. If any of the foregoing processes reveals a suspect application or process, our software may (1) scan the files associated with the suspect application or process and compile a composite mesh (i.e. a profile that characterizes the files associated with the application or process) to be matched against profiles for known illicit automated programs, and (2) capture a screenshot of your desktop, and transmit these to BETSHARKS.com for review. Our software will not perform any random search of large portions of your hard drive or other files, and will not transmit any information to us or to any third party other than the information necessary to identify use of illicit automated program as described above. Our software will not alter any files or information on your computer, and will not interfere with the operation of any of your applications. You may terminate use of our software at any time by uninstalling the BETSHARKS.com software package.</p><br>
<ol style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 25px" type="1" start="10"><br>
<li><strong>Security</strong></li></ol><br>

<p>By clicking 'Submit' or 'I agree' during the registration process or by your continued use of the Services following the posting of this Privacy Policy (as applicable), You agree to this Privacy Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with Our Terms and Conditions of Use and any additional applicable terms posted on Our Platforms.

<p><strong>Credit Card Usage Policy</strong></p><br>
<ol style="MARGIN-LEFT: 50px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 25px" type="1"><br>
<li>All credit card transactions are charged in US dollars.</li><br>
<li>All players using a credit card to deposit at BETSHARKS.com agree to complete any reasonable verification requirements to prove that they are the authorized cardholder.<br>As a verification procedure, some BETSHARKS.com credit card deposits may actually be charged to your card as a random amount below the actual value of your deposit. We may then ask you to provide us with this random amount (in $US) to verify the amount of the transaction, proving that you have access to the credit card statement and are most likely the authorized card owner. For example if a player submits a $100 deposit, we may actually charge the credit card $99.86, but deposit $100 to the player's BETSHARKS.com account. We will then ask the player exactly how much was charged to the card, and if they look at their statement they should be able to tell us the correct answer of $99.86.</li><br>
<li>Some credit card deposits may not be charged to your card immediately. As a fraud protection measure, in certain circumstances we will only pre-authorize a charge to your card and then the settle the transaction when we are satisfied that it is a legitimate charge. Many banks also have processing delays, especially if a charge is submitted on a weekend. It is not unusual to see delays of up to 5-10 days between when you submit a transaction to your BETSHARKS.com account and the charge actually appears on your credit card statement.</li><br>
<li>Players are emailed a transaction receipt for every credit card deposit made at BETSHARKS.com. Please keep a copy of these transaction receipts for your records.</li><br>
<li>Details of your BETSHARKS.com credit card transactions are displayed in the history tab of the cashier within the BETSHARKS.com software, and are also displayed on the player ledger page of the player admin.</li><br>
<li>BETSHARKS.com uses various billing companies and merchant accounts to process credit card transactions. These merchants do not take nor accept any responsibility if the cardholder is not satisfied with the services offered by BETSHARKS.com. Some of these companies are listed below for player reference.<br>

You may request a refund at any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@betsharks.com">support@betsharks.com</a>. Where possible will cancel the transaction or refund directly to the credit card used to make the account deposit, but in some cases we may not be able to do this due to credit card processing regulations. In the event that we are not able to cancel a transaction or refund directly to a credit card, a refund sent directly to a nominated bank account. Some verification from the cardholder may be required in the event that we are not able to refund directly to a card.</li><br>
<li>If you should have any queries related to a credit card transaction, please contact us. Most issues and questions regarding the use of credit cards, often arise due to a player's lack of knowledge of transaction processing procedures. We will always help wherever possible.</li><br>
<li>Remember that credit card fraud is not a game. If you dispute valid transactions at BETSHARKS.com we will track you down, prosecute you and recover all debts in full along with related fines and fees. It is against the law to dispute valid transactions and even if your bank allows you to reverse a transaction it does not mean you are legally authorized to do so.</li></ol><br>
