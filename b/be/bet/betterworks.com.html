<p>
BetterWorks collects two types of information from our Users: (i) Personally Identifiable Information; and (ii) Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Each of the foregoing types of information is described below.
</p>
<div class="h4">Personally Identifiable Information</div>
<p>
Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific User.

</p>
<p>
When you order Goods, we will ask you to provide us with your credit card (e.g., credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes) or other payment method information, or related information. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.
</p>
<p>
We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide Goods and other services or products to you, enhance the operation of the Website, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website use, determine the popularity of Goods or other services or products, improve our service and product offerings and to tailor your experience with third parties.
