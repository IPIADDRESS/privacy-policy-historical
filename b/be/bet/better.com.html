          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

          <hr>

          <p>We take our clientsâ€™ privacy very seriously. We understand that your privacy is important. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use the personal information that we collect about you on www.better.com (the "Website").</p>

          <p>By continuing to use the Website, you agree to this Privacy Policy and the collection, use, disclosure, and storage of your personal information as described by this Privacy Policy.</p>

          <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

          <p>When you use the Website, we may collect personal information about you, such as your name, address, Social Security number, telephone number, email address, asset information, income information, or any other information that you submit on applications or other forms made available through the Website.</p>

          <p>We may also collect personal information about you from third party sources, which we may combine with information that you provided to us or we previously collected. For example, we may receive information from a social media service about you if you use a social media account to log into the Website.</p>

          <p>We also automatically collect certain anonymous information when you visit the Website. This information includes information such as your IP address, your internet browser and operating system type, the date and time of your visit, and the website that referred you to us.</p>

          <h2>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>

          <p>Our Website uses cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons (otherwise known as pixel tags). A "cookie" is a small file placed on your computer that helps us to recognize your browser. We use both first and third-party cookies and tracking technologies on the Website. These cookies and tracking technologies do not collect your personal information. We may use cookies and tracking technologies to monitor how the Website is used, to customize content, to serve advertisements and evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, to identify problems with the Website, to improve the Website, analyze Website traffic and other analytics purposes, to monitor the security of the Website, and to gauge the effectiveness of our communications. Most web browsers allow you to adjust your preferences to reject cookies or to receive notifications before they are placed. If your browser is set to reject cookies, you may continue to use the Website, but some aspects of the Website may not function as intended.</p>

          <h2>Do Not Track</h2>

          <p>Our first party cookies and tracking technologies do not track users over time and across third party websites, and therefore the Website does not respond to web browser do not track signals.</p>

          <p>We also use third-party cookies to serve targeted advertisements on both the Website and on third-party websites. These cookies may track users over time and across third-party websites and services. Please note that if you opt-out of advertising cookies, you may still see our advertisements on third-party websites and services.</p>

          <h2>How We Use Collected Information</h2>

          <p>We use personal information and anonymous information for the following purposes:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>To respond to and fulfill your requests;</li>
            <li>For our marketing efforts, such as to send you marketing communications that we believe may be of interest to you;</li>
            <li>For our business purposes, such as for analysis and to develop new products and services;</li>
            <li>To improve the Website and for analytics purposes; or</li>
            <li>For any other purpose to which you consent.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How We Share Personal Information</h2>

          <p>We will only share personal information with third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. We may share personal information with third parties:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Such as social media services that we partner with;</li>
            <li>For any purpose to which you expressly consent;</li>
            <li>To protect our rights or the rights or safety of others; and</li>
            <li>As may be required by law or regulation.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We also share personal information with our third party service providers. We require that our service providers only use shared personal information to perform the services requested in accordance with this Privacy Policy and have adequate security measures in place to protect any of your shared personal information.</p>

          <p>In the event that we enter into a corporate transaction, such as a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), we may transfer personal information that we have collected to the relevant third party.</p>

          <h2>How We Protect Personal Information</h2>

          <p>Better uses reasonable physical, technical, and administrative security measures to protect personal information we collect from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, or improper disclosure. For example, we use encryption technologies when transmitting information to and from the Website. Please understand that no security technology is completely secure, and remember that when communicating with Better, email is not a secure form of communication when transmitting sensitive or personal information.</p>

          <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
