	<h1 class="text-center">Privacy Policy</h1>

	    <p>Better AG ("Better")
      operates <a href="https://better.com" target="_blank">http://better.com</a> (the "Service"). It is
      our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we
      may collect while operating our website. If you have questions
      about deleting or correcting your personal data
      please <a href="en/company/#contact">contact us</a>.</p>


      <p>
        <strong>Better cares deeply about your privacy. Not only
          because we think you'll be mad at us if we don't, but
          because it's right.</strong> What you do is nobody else's
          business, unless you want them to know so that they can help
          you with something.

        We follow these principles:

      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we
          need it to improve the learning experience.
        </li>

        <li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to
          comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our
          rights [1].
        </li>

        <li>
          We aim to make it as simple as possible to control
          what information other users and the public can see about
          you.
        </li>

      </ul>

      <p>

        [1] Sadly, the applicable law in most countries doesn't respect
        privacy anywhere near as much as they ought to.  From a privacy
        point of view, complying with the law is therefore scary. We'll try
        our utmost to do the right thing, but since governments have guns,
        we can't make any promises.

      </p>


      <h2>What information we collect</h2>

        <h3>Device information</h3>
        <p>

          We may collect device-specific information, such as your hardware
          model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, browser
          type, browser language, referral URL, or mobile network information.

        </p>
        <h3>Log information</h3>
        <p>

          When you use Better, our server logs may collect certain
          information about your activities, including details of pages you
          viewed, the date and time of each request, and IP addresses.

        </p>

        <h3>Learning data</h3>
        <p>

          Our learning products are data-driven. In order to provide the best
          learning experience, we collect detailed data about your
          interactions with Better, for example exercises completed,
          responses provided, activity patterns, etc.

        </p>

        <h3>Local storage</h3>

        <p>

          We may collect and store information (including personal
          information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser
          web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.

        </p>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>

          A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a
          visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the
          website each time the visitor returns. We use cookies to help us
          identify and track visitors, their usage of our products, and their
          website access preferences.

        </p><p>

          Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers
          should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using our
          products, with the drawback that certain features may not function
          properly without the aid of cookies.

        </p>
        <h3>Provided by you</h3>
        <p>

          Certain visitors to our website choose to interact with our product
          in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying
          information. The amount and type of information that we gather
          depends on the nature of the interaction.

        </p>

        <p>

          For example, to learn using Better, a user is asked to provide
          information such as name and email address. Those who engage in
          transactions with us, for example by purchasing access to particular
          material or functionality, are asked to provide additional
          information, including as necessary the personal and financial
          information required to process those transactions.

        </p><p>

          In each case, we collect such information only insofar as is
          necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's
          interaction with Better. Visitors can always refuse to supply
          personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may
          prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

        </p>

      <h2>How we use the information</h2>

        <p>

          We use the information we collect from our users to maintain,
          protect and improve our services, and to develop new ones. We use
          information collected from cookies and other technologies, like
          pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality
          of our services.

        </p>

        <h3>Support</h3>

        <p>

          When you contact us, we may keep a record of your communication to
          help solve any issues you might be facing.  If you send us a request
          (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
          mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish a de-personalised,
          anonymised version of it in order to help us clarify or respond to
          your request or to help us support other users.

        </p>

        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>

          We may process personal information on our servers in any country in
          the world, and therefore cannot guarantee that your information will
          be processed or stored on a server located in the country where you
          live.

        </p>

        <h3>News</h3>

        <p>

          If you are a registered user of our website and have supplied your
          email address, we may occasionally send you an email to tell you
          about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
          date with what's going on with Better and our products.

        </p>

      <h2>When we share the information</h2>

        <p>

          We do not share potentially personally-identifying or
          personally-identifying information with outside parties unless one
          of the following circumstances apply.

        </p>


        <h3>With your consent</h3>
        <p>

          We will share personal information when we have your consent to do
          so. This will always be done on an opt-in, rather than an opt-out,
          basis. In other words, we will not assume that we have your consent.

        </p>

        <h3>With your organisations</h3>
        <p>

          As a Better user, you can opt-in to interact with groups
          representing different types of organisations (typically, your
          employer) on Better.

        </p><p>

          If you do so, others authorized by the organisation (e.g. your
          managers, HR colleagues, or external service providers) will have
          access to some of the information we hold about you (including your
          email and other data). In particular, they may be able to:

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>view statistics about your account, including what you
            are learning, how much time you have spent doing so, how
            much longer we expect you will need to reach your goals,
            etc.
          </li>
          <li>enroll you in new courses, or change your goals for
            existing courses
          </li>
          <li>change your account's email address or password</li>
          <li>suspend or terminate your account access</li>
          <li>receive your account information in order to satisfy
            applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable
            governmental request
          </li>
          <li>restrict your ability to delete or edit information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

          In such cases, please refer to your organisations' privacy policy
          for more information.

        </p>

        <h3>With our service providers</h3>
        <p>

          We disclose such information only to those of our employees,
          contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
          information in order to process it on our behalf or to provide
          services available at our websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to
          disclose it to others.

        </p><p>

          Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
          organizations may be located outside of your home
          country. By using our websites, you consent to the transfer
          of such information to them. We will not rent or sell such
          information to anyone.

        </p>

        <h3>For legal reasons</h3>
        <p>

          We will share personal information with outside parties outside if
          we:

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>are required to do so by law</li>
          <li>believe in good faith that access, use, preservation or
            disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to
            protect the property or rights of Better, third parties or
            the public at large
          </li>

          <li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security
            or technical issues
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>In a depersonalised, aggregated way</h3>
        <p>

          We may share statistics about the behavior of visitors to our
          websites. For instance, we may monitor the most popular courses. We
          may display this aggregated information publicly or provide it to
          others.

        </p>

        <h2>Accessing and updating your personal information</h2>
        <p>

          Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to
          your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive
          to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it — unless
          we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal
          purposes.

        </p>
        <h2>Transparency and choice</h2>
        <p>

          People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear
          about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful
          choices about how it is used.

        </p>

        <h2>Information security</h2>

        <p>

          We take all measures reasonably necessary to protect against
          the unauthorized access to, use of, alteration of, or
          destruction of personal information.

        </p>
        <h2>Terms of service</h2>
        <p>

          Use of the Service is subject to our Terms of Service. This
          Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with them. In
          the event of a conflict or disagreement between this Privacy
          Policy and the Terms of Service, the Terms of Service shall
          prevail.

        </p>
        <h2>Continuation</h2>
        <p>

          If Better is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we
          will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal
          information and give affected users notice before personal
          information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy
          policy.

        </p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
          Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change
          our Privacy Policy from time to time, and in our sole
          discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will post any privacy policy changes on this page, and
          encourage you to check it for any changes to our Privacy
          Policy. If the changes are significant, we will aim to
          provide a more prominent notice — email notifications,
          for example.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your continued use of this site after any change in this
          Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such
          change. We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy
          Policy in an archive for your review.
        </p>
