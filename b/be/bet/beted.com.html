			  <p>At betED.com, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting 
			    your personal information. We have created this Privacy Policy to 
			    let you know what information we collect when you visit the betED.com 
			    web site and online service (collectively, the “Service”), 
			    why we collect this information and how we use the collected information. 
			     
			    By using the Service, you consent to the data practices prescribed 
			    in this Privacy Policy. We may periodically make changes to this 
			    Privacy Policy that we will include on this page. It is your responsibility 
			    to review this Privacy Policy frequently and remain informed about 
			    any changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often.</p>
			  <p><strong>We will never provide your information to a 3rd party for any other purpose than to verify your payment information. Your data will never be disclosed to any goverment organization and is securely stored using SSL Version 3 with 128 bit encryption, and is removed from our systems once we no longer require it.</strong></p>
			  <p><strong>1. Information Collected.</strong> We consider information 
			    that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited 
			    to, first and last name, credit card information, home or other 
			    physical address, email address, phone number or other contact information 
			    to be “Personal Information.” You may be asked to provide 
			    Personal Information when you use our web site, register for an 
			    account or to use our services, download our software, correspond 
			    with us by email, or provide us with feedback regarding this web 
			    site or our products and services. The Personal Information that 
			    we collect may include: contact information, 
			    billing information, transaction history, web site usage preferences, 
			    and feedback regarding our products and services. In addition, when 
			    you interact with the Service, our servers keep an activity log 
			    unique to you that collects the information including: source IP 
			    address, time of access, date of access, web page(s) visited, language 
			    use, and type of browser used. This is not considered Personal Information. 
			    In general, you can visit the betED.com website without telling 
			    us who you are and without revealing any Personal Information about 
			    yourself. We do not collect Personal Information about you on the 
			    Service unless you voluntarily provide it to us.</p>
			  <p><strong>2. Means of Collecting &amp; Processing Data</strong>. 
			    We may automatically collect certain data as discussed above and 
			    receive Personal Information about you where you provide such information 
			    through the Service or other communications and interactions with 
			    betED.com We may also receive Personal Information from online vendors 
			    and service providers that refer you to the betED.com website. In 
			    addition, we may engage the services of third-party service providers 
			    to provide technical support, process your online transactions and 
			    maintain your online accounts. We will have access to any information 
			    you provide to such vendors, service providers and third-party e-commerce 
			    services so that we can process your transactions, maintain your 
			    accounts, meet certain business requirements and provide you with 
			    promotional offers and information regarding betED.com and our products 
			    and services. We use this Personal Information to process your transactions 
			    and support your use of the Service. This information may be disclosed 
			    only to our staff and to third parties involved in the completion 
			    of your transactions or in support of your use of the Service.</p>
			  <p><strong>3. Information Use.</strong> We use the Personal Information 
			    we collect from you to deliver the products and services you purchase, 
			    and to provide customer support, to process any of your online transactions, 
			    to answer your questions, and for any other purpose related to the 
			    operation of the Service and the programs, products and services 
			    offered on the betED.com website. From time-to-time, 
			    we may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation 
			    in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and, therefore, 
			    you have the choice of whether or not to disclose such information. 
			    Information requested may include contact information (such as name 
			    and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip 
			    code, age level). By accepting any contest prize or winnings from 
			    us, you consent to use of your name and likeness for advertising 
			    and promotional purposes without additional compensation, except 
			    where prohibited by law. Unless you have elected not to receive 
			    promotional information, we may also use your Personal Information 
			    (including your email address) to provide you with information regarding 
			    our products, services and promotions.  We will not ever sell, lease or otherwise share your Personal Information with 3rd parties without your express written consent. In the case that you do provide consent, sharing of your information will be restricted exclusively to that of 3rd party payment processors and will be used for no purpose other than to verify your payment information. </p>
			  <p><strong>4. Access.</strong> If you are interested in confirming 
			    the accuracy of the Personal Information we have collected about 
			    you, or if you would like to update your Personal Information or 
			    delete your Personal Information, you may contact us at any time 
			    by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@beted.com">privacy@beted.com</a>, 
			    or by writing to us at betED, Apt. 90-1007, Centro Colon, Paseo 
			    Colon, San Jose, Costa Rica. If you have any complaint regarding 
			    our use of your Personal Information, you may send it through our 
			    customer service available by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@beted.com">privacy@beted.com</a>. 
			    If requested, we will change any information you have provided to 
			    us or mark any information to prohibit future use. You may “opt 
			    out” of receiving any promotional communications either by 
			    choosing to opt out where such option is made available on the betED.com 
			    website or the Service or in an email you receive from us, or at 
			    any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@beted.com">privacy@beted.com</a>, 
			    or by writing to us at betED, Apt. 90-1007, Centro Colon, Paseo 
		      Colon, San Jose, Costa Rica.</p>
			  <p><strong>5. Cookies.</strong> Cookies are small text files that 
			    are stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages that 
			    record your preferences. We use cookies to track use of the betED.com 
			    website. We also may use cookies to improve the Service and make 
			    it easier for you to use. You have the ability to accept or decline 
			    cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if 
			    you prefer you can usually modify your browser setting to decline 
			    cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to 
			    fully experience the interactive features of the betED.com website.</p>
			  <p><strong>6. Consent to Use of Anti-Cheating Software.</strong> Our 
			    software package used to access and use the Service contains certain 
			    features designed to detect use of automated programs that enable 
			    artificial (non-human) intelligence to play on our site. Use of 
			    such “bot” software programs violates our Terms and 
			    Conditions of Use, and is detrimental to other players. By installing 
			    our software and using the Service, you consent to our software 
			    performing the functions described in this section. Our software 
			    may perform any or all of the following functions in order to detect 
			    the use of illicit automated programs and ensure that we maintain 
			    a “cheat free” environment for all users: (1) scan your 
			    list of active software applications while you are using the Service, 
			    (2) scan your list of active processes while you are using the service, 
			    (3) scan the files in your betED.com-related program folders to 
			    ensure that only “non-hacked” versions of our software 
			    are being used. If any of the foregoing processes reveals a suspect 
			    application or process, our software may (1) scan the files associated 
			    with the suspect application or process and compile a composite 
			    mesh (i.e. a profile that characterizes the files associated with 
			    the application or process) to be matched against profiles for known 
			    illicit automated programs, and (2) capture a screenshot of your 
			    desktop, and transmit these to betED.com for review. Our software 
			    will not perform any random search of large portions of your hard 
			    drive or other files, and will not transmit any information to us 
			    or to any third party other than the information necessary to identify 
			    use of illicit automated program as described above. Our software 
			    will not alter any files or information on your computer, and will 
			    not interfere with the operation of any of your applications. </p>
			  <p><strong>7. Security.</strong> We understand the importance of information 
			    security and the techniques needed to secure information. We store 
			    all of the Personal Information it receives directly from you in 
			    a password-protected database residing within our secure network 
			    behind active state-of-the-art firewall software. The betED.com website 
			    and the Service support SSL Version 3 with 128 bit encryption.</p>
			  <p><strong>8. Protection of Children.</strong> The Service is not 
			    intended for or directed to persons under the age of 18. Any person 
			    who provides their information to us through any part of the Service 
			    represents to us that they are 18 years of age or older. It is our 
			    policy to endorse the Children’s Online Privacy Protection 
			    Act of 1998 and to use our best efforts to comply with that Act.</p>
			  <p><strong>9. International Transfers.</strong> Personal Information 
			    collected on the Service may be stored and processed in any country 
			    in which we or our affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, 
			    and by using the Service, you consent to any transfer of information 
			    outside of your country.</p>
			  <p><strong>10. Third-Party Practices.</strong> We cannot ensure the 
			    protection of any information or images that you provide to a third-party 
			    website that links to or from the betED.com website or any information 
			    collected by any third party administering our affiliate program 
			    or any other program, since these third-party websites are owned 
			    and operated independent of us. Any information collected by these 
			    third parties is not governed by this Privacy Policy but by the 
			    privacy policy, if any, of such third party. If you have questions 
			    about a third party’s information practices, please read its 
			    privacy policy. We assume no responsibility or liability whatsoever 
			    for the practices, actions or policies of such third parties, and 
			    is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such 
			    websites.</p>
			  <p><strong>11. Legal Disclaimer.</strong> The Service operates “AS-IS” 
			    and “AS-AVAILABLE,” without liability of any kind. We 
			    are not responsible for events beyond our direct control. Because 
			    of the complex and constantly changing nature of our technology 
			    and business, we cannot guarantee nor do we represent that there 
			    will be error-free performance regarding the privacy of your Personal 
			    Information, and we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, 
			    consequential or punitive damages relating to the use or release 
			    of Personal Information.</p>
			  <p><strong>12. Consent to Privacy Statement.</strong> By using the 
			    Service, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This is our entire and 
			    exclusive Privacy Statement and it supersedes any earlier version. 
			    We may occasionally update this Privacy Statement. We encourage 
			    you to periodically review this Privacy Policy. Your continued use 
			    of the Service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy 
			    and any updates.</p>
