<p><strong>6. Consent to Use of Anti-Cheating Software.</strong> Our software   package used to access and use the Service contains certain features designed to   detect use of automated programs that enable artificial (non-human) intelligence   to play on our site. Use of such â€œbotâ€ software programs violates our Terms and   Conditions of Use, and is detrimental to other players. By installing our   software and using the Service, you consent to our software performing the   functions described in this section. Our software may perform any or all of the   following functions in order to detect the use of illicit automated programs and   ensure that we maintain a â€œcheat freeâ€ environment for all users: (1) scan your   list of active software applications while you are using the Service, (2) scan   your list of active processes while you are using the service, (3) scan the   files in your betED.com-related program folders to ensure that only â€œnon-hackedâ€   versions of our software are being used. If any of the foregoing processes   reveals a suspect application or process, our software may (1) scan the files   associated with the suspect application or process and compile a composite mesh   (i.e. a profile that characterizes the files associated with the application or   process) to be matched against profiles for known illicit automated programs,   and (2) capture a screenshot of your desktop, and transmit these to betED.com   for review. Our software will not perform any random search of large portions of   your hard drive or other files, and will not transmit any information to us or   to any third party other than the information necessary to identify use of   illicit automated program as described above. Our software will not alter any   files or information on your computer, and will not interfere with the operation   of any of your applications. </p>
<p><strong>7. Security.</strong> We understand the importance of information   security and the techniques needed to secure information. We store all of the   Personal Information it receives directly from you in a password-protected   database residing within our secure network behind active state-of-the-art   firewall software. The betED.com website and the Service support SSL Version 3   with 128 bit encryption.</p>

Third-Party Practices.</strong> We cannot ensure the protection   of any information or images that you provide to a third-party website that   links to or from the betED.com website or any information collected by any third   party administering our affiliate program or any other program, since these   third-party websites are owned and operated independent of us.
