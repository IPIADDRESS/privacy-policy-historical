<p>The beGalileo team ("Company") knows that you care about how information about you is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. We appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the beGalileo website &amp; domain name, and any other linked pages, features, content, or application services offered from time to time by Company in connection therewith (collectively, the "Website"), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover? </h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers Company's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Company gathers when you access the Website and when you use Company's services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.</p>

<h3>How is my child's personal information treated?</h3>
<p>If you are a minor (under the age of 18), you may only use this service and disclose Personal Information with your parent, school, teacher or guardian's express consent. Company only collects limited Personal Information from students ("Children's Personal Information") directly from the school, teacher, parent or guardian who has registered and paid for the Services. If you are below the age of eighteen (18), please do not send any Children's Personal Information about yourself to us, other than what we request from your parent or guardian who registers for the Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected Children's Personal Information from a student without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, and/or teacher, or if we learn a minor has provided us Children's Personal Information beyond what we request during the registration process, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student may have provided us Children's Personal Information beyond what is requested when signing up for the Website, or that a student's school, or teacher has not obtained parental consent, please contact us at support@carveniche.com. Hereinafter, references to "Personal Information" shall apply to personal information of individual Website users who are not student registrants. References to "Children's Personal Information" shall only apply to personal information of student users of the Website. General references to "information" shall apply to all users. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if you are a minor and your school, teacher, parent or guardian has signed up for the Website, you understand that your parent or teacher can view all information within or associated with the account, including without limitation progress reports and usage data that tracks your performance on assessments, assignments and other features available through the Services.</p>

<h3>What Personal Information Does the Company Collect? </h3>
<p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers:</p>

<h3>Information You Provide to Us: </h3>
<p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected include your full name, email address, mobile number (optional), credit card and/or other payment information, Children's Personal Information (which is limited to the child's name), IP address, browser and location information, username, password and any other information necessary for us to provide our services. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, sending product updates, and communicating with you about Company's products and services, including specials and new features. The Children's Personal Information you provide shall only be used for creating your individual account (which will allow you to receive progress reports that include tracking your child's performance and progress). You may modify or remove your Personal Information or Children's Personal Information identified below at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and/or account information.</p>

<h3>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</h3>
<p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use our services. Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components. Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Website or services. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Company never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>

<h3>E-mail Communications:</h3>
<p>We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Company if your computer supports this type of program. Company uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. When you receive e-mail from Company, you can opt out of receiving further e-mails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe.</p>

<h3>What About Cookies?</h3>
<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. We use cookies to enhance visitors' experiences, to learn more about their use of the Website and to improve quality. 
Company cookies do not collect Personal Information or Children's Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information or Children's Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.</p>
<p> Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Website's most attractive features. If third party links appear through advertisements on the Website, those third party sites may use cookies.
