<p class="subheader">Personal Information We Collect at this Website
</p>
<p class="subheader">We use data and information to enhance our ability to provide the services we offer. When you engage in certain activities on this Website, such as creating an account, ordering products or services, entering or winning a sweepstakes or contest, or other activities, we may ask you to provide certain personal information about yourself.  We define "personal information" as information that is unique to you, which might include your phone number, first and last name, age, email address, mailing address, and date of birth.  If you order goods or services, we may ask you to provide us with your credit or debit card number and its expiration date, authentication code, and other associated or related information, which also may be personal information. If you encounter a screen or page that requests information you do not want to share with us, do not enter the information, and do not proceed with that screen or page. However, please be aware that, depending on the activity you are engaging in on this Website, some of the information may be mandatory and some may be voluntary.  If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be allowed to engage in that activity.
We may also receive personal information about you from other sources with which you have registered, companies with whom we have partnered, or other third parties.  We may associate this information with the other personal information we have collected about you.
</p>
<p class="subheader">Our Use and Release of Your Personal Information
