<h1>Privacy Policy for Become.com</h1>

<p><em>Updated: May 26, 2009</em></p>

<h6>About this Privacy Statement</h6>

<p>This Privacy Statement describes information that we collect from you as part of the normal operation of our service(s) and what may happen to the information we collect.</p>

<h6>Application of this Privacy Statement</h6>

<p>This Privacy Statement applies to all websites (“Site” or “Sites”) owned and controlled by Become, Inc. (“Become”, “we”, or “us”).  Please note that this Privacy Statement applies only to Sites owned and controlled by Become, Inc. and not to websites maintained by other entities to which we may link.</p>

<p>Through the submission of the information requested, including your personally identifiable information on this Site or otherwise using or accessing this Site, you agree that the following terms and conditions of this Privacy Statement shall govern our use and disclosure of your personal information. If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of our Privacy Statement, please do not complete any information request forms hosted on this site or otherwise use or access this Site.</p>

<p>This Site does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on this Site. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us.</p>

<b>Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18</b>

<p>Minors 13 years of age or older must ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.  By using this Site you represent that you are 13 or over, or where appropriate/indicated you are at least 17 and have you parent’s express permission.</p>

<p>If we have any reason to believe you have misrepresented your age we reserve the right to terminate your use of the Site without notice.
There are many resources available to help families with issues of Internet safety for children, including www.safekids.com.</p>

<h6>Your Privacy is Important to Us</h6>

<p>Our Privacy Statement explains what information we obtain on the Site and how we use the information you disclose to us, including how we may provide your information to our Third Party Partners who have expressed a willingness to provide you with the products and services associated with this Site.</p>

<h6>Information We Collect</h6>

<p>The information that we collect includes personal information about you that we or certain of our Third Party Partners consider necessary for performing a preliminary evaluation of your qualifications to receive applicable products and/or services. Depending on the extent that you access/use our service(s), the type of personally identifiable information that may be collected may include (without limitation): name; address; e-mail address; telephone number; fax number; credit card information; information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services; education level; educational interests; home owner status; income; debt level and the like. To the extent that you are requested and you do submit information about other people, such information will be limited recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. On some of the Sites you may be able to become a registered user. When you decide to become a registered user, we ask for some basic contact information which we use to enable use of certain features of the Site (e.g., avatar, creation, community participation, submission of product/merchant reviews and creation of lists etc.) and to send you information about our company, services and products, and to communicate occasional offers from our partners and advertisers.</p>

<u>Cookies</u>

<p>In addition to the personal information you provide to us, we collect certain information online and offline arising out of your use of our Site, including but not limited to the number and type of offers you have responded to and completed.  When you visit our Site, we automatically track certain non-personally identifiable information with respect to your behavior on the Site through the cookie we place in your browser.  This non-personally identifiable information may include the Internet address or URL that you just came from and the URL to which you go next; your computer browser information; and your IP address.  We use this non-personally identifiable information in conjunction with some of the information that you provided to conduct internal research on users' demographics and behavior and to better understand how to serve users of the Site. The aforementioned information cannot, by itself, be used to gather any personally identifiable information about you, but it will allow us to track the overall effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns.  Third parties may also set cookies on or through the service to track Site usage and to track the overall effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns.</p>

<p>We use both session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his/her browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the user's computer until manually deleted.  You may decline our cookies if your Web browser software permits, although this may prevent you from accessing certain features of the Site(s).</p>

<u>Log Files</u>

<p>We track certain non-personally identifiable information through server log files.  This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp and number of clicks to analyze trends and administer the Site, track user's movement in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  We use your IP address at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses the Site.  We do not presently tie server log files to personally identifiable information.</p>

<u>Web Beacons</u>

<p>We may employ and certain Third Party Partners may employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as Web Beacons or Web Bugs).  Clear gifs help us better manage content through the service by informing us what content and which campaigns are effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics, about the size of a period at the end of a sentence, with a unique identifier.  Clear gifs are similar in function to cookies and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In addition, we and certain Third Party Partners may use clear gifs in HTML-based emails.  This allows us and the Third Party Partner to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by showing how many emails the recipients have opened.  We do not presently tie clear gifs to personally identifiable information. If you wish to opt out of the use of third party clear gifs, you may do so at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>

<h6>How We Use Your Information</h6>

<p><strong>General:</strong> In general we may use information we collect about you to:</p>
<ul style="padding-left:25px; margin-bottom:15px;">

<li>Provide the products and services that you have requested;</li>

<li>Perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in our products, services, content, or the products, services, or content offered by third parties;</li>

<h6>How We Protect Your Privacy</h6>

<p>We protect your privacy in a number of ways. As an initial matter, any Financial Information transmitted to our servers via a secure server is encrypted using SSL technology. SSL is a protocol that transmits your communications over the Internet in an encrypted form. The protocol ensures that the information is sent, unchanged, only to the server you intended to send it to.</p>

<p>Once your Financial Information reaches our server, it is protected by a firewall. In addition to encryption and firewall protections, our Third Party Partners are required to operate in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations, including regulations relating to CAN-SPAM and rules promulgated by the FTC. If we learn that any of our Third Party Partners is breaching our agreement, we will take corrective actions including, if necessary, terminate our relationship with such Third Party Partner.</p>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security or that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Statement. For example, third parties may unlawfully intercept personal data or access our servers and obtain personal data. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, nor should you expect that your personal information would always remain private.  By using this Site, you agree that we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any data provided to or received by us through the Site and that any personal information, general information, or other data or information received from you through the Site is provided to us at your own risk.</p>

Please note that if our information practices change at some time in the future, we will use only data collected from the time of the new Privacy Statement amendment forward for those new purposes.
