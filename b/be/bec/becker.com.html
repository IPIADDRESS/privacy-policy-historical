<li><strong>General.<br>
  </strong> Becker Professional Development Corporation and its related companies or affiliates ("Becker" or "we") respect the privacy of every individual who visits our web sites or responds to our promotions. Becker intends to act reasonably to protect your privacy, but obviously cannot guaranty security against "hackers" or other issues beyond our control. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on Becker web sites, unless otherwise posted.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
<li><strong>Information Collected From You.</strong><br>
  Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that is collected in conjunction with your name.  Becker does not collect any personally identifiable information from you unless you provide it voluntarily.  If you do not want your personally identifiable information collected, do not submit it to us.   Becker may collect other information from you that is not in conjunction with your name.  Although most of this information is collected from you when you submit it voluntarily, some of it may be collected automatically by use of a “cookie.”  Cookies are small text files that reside on your computer and identify you as a unique user. Cookies allow us to, among other things, measure activity on our website and to personalize your experience on our website.  For instance, cookies may enable us to remember your viewing preferences without requiring you to re-type a user name and password.  Cookies may also allow us to track your status or progress when ordering products from us.  If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete individual or all of the cookies on your computer by following your browser’s help file directions. However, if your browser is set to reject cookies or you manually delete cookies, you may have some trouble accessing and using some of the pages and features on our website.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
<li><strong>How We Use the Information We Collect.</strong><br>
    We use the information that we collect to complete a contact or request; to better understand your needs, to provide to Becker marketing, to improve our products and services, and to contact you.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
<li><strong>Sharing Information That You Provide With Others.</strong><br>
    Generally we do not give or sell your information, including your personally identifiable information, with outside companies except in the following situations:<br>
    <br>
   	
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blogs and Online Communities.</span>  You may choose to submit information as part of a blog or online community offered by Becker.  Any information you choose to post, including personally identifiable information, may be available generally to the public, or to other members of the blog or online community.   </li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subcontractors.</span>  We may share your information with subcontractors that provide us with services.  These services may include, among other things, helping to provide services that you request, helping to create or maintain our databases, helping to research and analyze the people who request services or information from us, helping to provide marketing or solicitation materials for our products or services, and/or helping to process payment card information</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Law Enforcement.</span>  We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful, or that we reasonably believe may aid a law enforcement investigation into unlawful activity.  In addition, we reserve the right to release your information to law enforcement agencies if we determine, in our sole judgment, that either you have violated our policies, or the release of your information may protect the rights, property or safety of you or another person.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Permitted by Law.</span>  We may share your information with others as required by, or permitted by, law.  This may include sharing your information with governmental entities, or third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, other legal process, or as we believe is necessary to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims that have been brought against us, or to defend against possible legal claims that we determine in our sole discretion might be brought against us.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Transfers.</span>  In the event that Becker, or substantially all of Becker’s assets, are acquired, your Information will be transferred to the acquiring entity.  In such a situation, you will be provided with notice that a transfer of your Information is imminent, and you will be given an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of your information.<br>
