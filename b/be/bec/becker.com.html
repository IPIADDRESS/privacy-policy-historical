<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
<p>We may collect other personal data from you that is not collected along with your name.&nbsp; Although most of this information is collected from you when you freely consent to submit it, some of it may be collected automatically by use of a “cookie.”</p>
<p>Cookies are small text files that are downloaded onto your computer or other device when you access a website. Cookies allow the website to recognize your device and store information about your preferences or past actions.&nbsp; For instance, cookies may enable us to remember your viewing preferences without requiring you to re-type a user name and password or be used by third party content providers such as news feeds.&nbsp; Cookies may also allow us to track your status or progress when ordering products from us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What kinds of Cookies do we use?</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Strictly Necessary Cookies</i></b></li>

<p>Certain cookies we use are necessary for the website to function.&nbsp; Strictly necessary cookies are typically set in response to actions or services that you request, such as setting your privacy preferences or putting items in a shopping basket.&nbsp; If you set your browser to block these cookies, some parts of the site will not work.</p>

<ul>
<li><b><i>Performance Cookies</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p>We use performance cookies to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site.&nbsp; They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. For example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how frequently the same people revisit the site, how the site is found (from advertising or referring websites), and which pages are most frequently viewed. This information is combined with data from thousands of other users to create an overall picture of site use, and is never identified individually or personally and is not linked to any other information we store about you. For more information about Google Analytics, or how to opt out of Google Analytics cookies, please visit <u><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a></u> and <u><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">Opt out page</a></u>.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Third Party Cookies</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of our webpages use third-party services or software, such as maps, online videos, or social networking features. Many of these services may set cookies on your device.

Opting out of advertising cookies won't stop you seeing adverts, just that they won't be tailored specifically to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Can Cookies be Blocked?</b></p>
<p>If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete individual or all of the cookies on your computer by following your browser’s help file directions.&nbsp; However, if your browser is set to reject cookies or you manually delete cookies, this may alter your access and use of some of the pages and features on our website.</p>

<li><b><i>Right to Complain to a Supervisory Authority</i></b></li>
