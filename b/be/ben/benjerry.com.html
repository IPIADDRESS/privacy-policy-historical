		<p>Ben &amp; Jerry’s Homemade, Inc. ("Ben &amp; Jerry’s” ) cares about your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the type of Personal Information that is collected by Ben &amp; Jerry’s from consumers and how we use and protect it.  This Policy also tells you what to do if you do not want your Personal Information used for marketing purposes, and how you can change information you have already provided to us. This Policy applies to Ben &amp; Jerry’s website and to Ben &amp; Jerry’s collection of data through printed promotional materials such as sweepstakes entry forms, coupons or other mail-in offers and telephone calls to Ben &amp; Jerry’s consumer services department. It does not apply to banners, sweepstakes or promotions sponsored by third parties in which Ben &amp; Jerry’s participates.</p>

		<p><a name="your"></a><a href="#top"><img src="assets/hd_up.gif" border="0" alt="Back to Top"></a>Your Consent to This Privacy Policy</p>
		
		<p>By providing Ben &amp; Jerry’s with Personal Information, you signify that you agree with the terms of our current Privacy Policy as posted here. If you do not agree with any term in this Policy, please do not provide any Personal Information.</p>
		
		<p>If you choose not to provide Personal Information, you may not be able to do certain things, like access particular areas of our website, enter sweepstakes or contests, request samples, or send us e-mail.</p>

		<p><a name="collection"></a><a href="#top"><img src="assets/hd_up.gif" border="0" alt="Back to Top"></a>Collection of Personal Information</p>

		<p>As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means personally identifiable information such as your name, street address, telephone number, credit card information, screen name and email address.</p>

		<p>When you provide us with Personal Information, you are authorizing us to use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, which includes your right to limit our use of your Personal Information (see <a href="#who">Who to Contact</a>).</p>

		<p>We may also collect Personal Information from you about a third party (e.g., our website might allow you to send an electronic “post card” to a friend, in which case we will need that person’s name and e-mail address). Please note that we use such information only for the specified purpose (e.g., to mail the post card) and we will not contact the third party again unless and until the third party contacts us.</p>

		<p><a name="how"></a><a href="#top"><img src="assets/hd_up.gif" border="0" alt="Back to Top"></a>How We Use Your Information</p>
 
		<p>When you supply us with your Personal Information we will use it for the express purpose for which it was collected (e.g., to enter you in a sweepstakes or to send you a sample). It may also be used to contact you regarding other products and services that may be of interest to you (including those we may offer jointly with other companies). At any time, however, you may opt out of such contact. (See <a href="#who">Who to Contact.</a>)</p>

		<p>At times we may retain third parties to analyze data we collect, including Personal Information, solely to help us improve our products and our web site. In addition, if you order a product or service from us, we may provide Personal Information to suppliers and other third parties to enable delivery of such product or service. These third parties, including suppliers, are not authorized by us to use your Personal Information in any other way. Ben &amp; Jerry’s does not sell Personal Information.</p>

		<p>We may supplement the information that you provide to us with other information that we receive from third parties.  We do this for marketing purposes in order to provide the most appropriate products and services to meet your needs.</p>

		<p>Finally, please note that we will release your Personal Information if required to do so by law, or by search warrant, subpoena or court order.</p>

		<p><a name="other"></a><a name="cookie"></a><a href="#top"><img src="assets/hd_up.gif" border="0" alt="Back to Top"></a>Other Information We May Collect Online</p>

We collect this information to better tailor our site and our products to your interests and needs. Cookies may also be used to help speed up your future activities at our site. For example, our site can recognize that you have provided Personal Information to us and refrain from requesting the same information a second time.</p>

		<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you’d prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent.

Information about your computer, such as your IP address (a number assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Internet), the type of Internet browser you are using and the type of computer operating system you are using may also be collected and linked to your Personal Information. This is to ensure that our web site presents the best web experience for visitors, and that they are an effective information resource.</p>

		<p>Finally, some of the pages you visit may use pixel tags (also called clear gifs) to collect information about your navigation on our website.  This information is used to evaluate and enhance how the website functions.</p>

		<p><a name="children"></a><a href="#top"><img src="assets/hd_up.gif" border="0" alt="Back to Top"></a>Privacy of Children Online</p>
