You might want to read our <a href="terms.html">Terms Of Use</a> too.
<p>
</p><blockquote><a name="privacy">This</a> Privacy Policy sets forth Ben &amp; Jerry's current policy regarding what information 
we gather from our Web site and how we use it. This policy is provided to you for 
informational purposes only. Please be advised that this policy may be changed by 
Ben &amp; Jerry's at any time.</blockquote>
<p>
We keep everything we find out through our Web site to ourselves. Usually we (the WebHeads) don't 
even share it with the marketing folks. We do not send spam, we 
do not solicit personal information from children, etc. We do accept <a href="http://lib.benjerry.com/ca/subscribe-new.html">voluntary subscriptions</a> to 
e-mail and/or snail mail newsletters. If you want to hear from us, you have to ask. If you send 
us feedback about our products, employees, company or Web site and include a return address 
(real or e-mail) we will probably try to respond to you.
</p><p>
We do not capture or in any way use e-mail addresses or information used and/or sent 
in our e-cards. All information sent in an e-card is deleted from the site fourteen days after 
the e-card is created. See our <a href="terms.html#submissions">submission policy</a> for more information on our e-cards.
</p><p>
We do look at our Web logs. The information in our logs includes, computer 
type, browser, version, domain (aol.com, etc.) and things like that. There is no personal 
information in our logs. We use this information to decide how to make our Web site more interesting and fun.
</p><p>
We also add up the numbers to see how many of you are doing what and what you're using 
to do it. We count how many people visit the site and what pages are most popular. We also 
check to see the date and time of your visit. The only personal information that we have is 
what you send us.
</p><p>
Personal information may be collected when you send us e-mail, fill out feedback forms, enter 
contests or subscribe to newsletters or catalogs. Again, we use this info ourselves and 
do not share it with anyone. Some contests may be run as co-promotions with other companies 
or organizations; we cannot control what they do with the information that they collect.
<a name="children"></a></p><h2><a name="children">CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</a></h2>
<b>Hey KIDS!</b> If you are under 16, please get your parents permission before contacting us. 
We'd love to hear from you and your parents.<p>
<b>Hey PARENTS!</b> Ben &amp; Jerry's encourages children to ask 
their parents before submitting any information to us. There is software available that 
can keep children from giving out personal information online without parental permission. 
Of course there is nothing better than personal supervision of your children while surfing the Net. 
For more information about parental control tools, please consult the 
"Privacy Action" page of the Direct Marketing Association home page (<a href="http://www.the-dma.org">www.the-dma.org</a>).
