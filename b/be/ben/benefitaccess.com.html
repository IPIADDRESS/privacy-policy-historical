<p><strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong></p>
<p>We, our affiliates and/or other persons acting on our or their behalf, use cookies and similar technology, such as web beacons (also known as clear GIFs or pixel tags), or similar technologies as they may develop over time.

We have internal policies governing the proper handling of personal information by our personnel and requiring third parties that provide support on our behalf to adhere to appropriate security standards with respect to such information.  As noted above, your current and/or former employer also will receive your personal information along with transactional and tax information and they will be subject to their own internal security procedures.</p>

<p>This Online Privacy Policy only applies to the use and disclosure of information we collect through our online services.  Our online services may contain links to other websites such as other Morgan Stanley websites and websites belonging to third parties, such as your current and/or former employer.  The inclusion of a link on our Site or App does not imply endorsement of the linked website or service by us.  While we try to link only to websites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other websites or links posted on our online services.  Information you disclose to other parties (including your current and/or former employer) or through such websites, is subject to the privacy and security practices and policies of those parties or websites.
