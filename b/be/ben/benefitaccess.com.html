<p><strong>Effective Date: September 2015</strong></p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC ("MSSB", "us", "our" or "we") is in possession of certain of your personal information (as defined below) and protecting that information is an important part of how we conduct our business.  We believe it is important for you to know how we treat information about you that we may receive from you or your current or former employer through this website at <a href="http://www.stockplanconnect.com" target="_blank">https://www.stockplanconnect.com</a> and any alternative, replicated and/or back up website made available by or on behalf of us (the "Website") or through a software application on a mobile device that was made available by or on behalf of us (an "App").  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using the Website or an App (collectively, our "online services").  This Privacy Policy is applicable only to individuals when accessing and using our online services.  Our online services are not directed to or intended for individuals under 18 years of age.</p>

<p>This Online Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, share and protect information when you access or use our online services and how you can update and control such information.  This Online Privacy Policy does not apply to other information we collect, including information collected on other sites, such as separate sites operated by us or by our affiliates or business partners or other information that may be provided to us through other means.</p>

<p>By visiting or using our online services, you are consenting to the practices and procedures described in this Privacy Policy, the GSPS Website Terms and Conditions <a href="https://www.stockplanconnect.com/docs/globalTermsAndConditions.html" target="_blank">https://www.stockplanconnect.com/docs/globalTermsAndConditions.html</a>  and the GSPS Mobile Terms <a href="https://www.stockplanconnect.com/docs/mobileTermsAndConditions.html" target="_blank">https://www.stockplanconnect.com/docs/mobileTermsAndConditions.html</a> and Conditions into which this Privacy Policy is incorporated.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected</strong></p>
<p>Personal information means personally identifiable information such as name, postal or email addresses, telephone, fax or mobile numbers, user name, password and account numbers.  There are portions of our online services where we may collect personal information about you.</p>
<p>In addition, when you visit the Website, our web servers collect the IP address of the device you used to access the Internet, which pages on the Website you visited and when they were visited, your Internet browser type and platform, the link that brought you to the Website and any links clicked within the Website.  This information may be used by us, our service providers, affiliates and business partners to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views and other statistics about visitors to the Website.  We also use this data to monitor the Website performance and make the Website easier and more convenient to use.</p>
<p>Our web servers also seek (as many websites do) to place a "cookie" (a small data file) on your computer's hard drive which allows the server to determine the computer when it visits again in order to track statistical information about navigation to and throughout certain areas of the Website.  This cookie is not used to obtain your name or any personal information, and the information that is tracked is used only for internal purposes, such as to improve the Website navigation and to measure the effectiveness of the Website, and is not shared with anyone other than MSSB affiliates and contractors who assist MSSB in these efforts and who are bound to confidentiality.  Many web browsers allow you to control the use of most cookies through their browser settings.  To learn more about cookies, including information on what cookies have been set on your computer and how cookies can be managed and deleted, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.  Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will reject cookies, our system will issue cookies when you access or use the Website.  In the event you refuse to accept cookies by adjusting your browser setting, some or all areas of the Website may not function properly or may not be accessible.

<p>When you download and use our Apps, we and companies we work with may track and collect application usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your unique device identifier, and may also collect the IP address of the device on which you use the App.  In addition, we may gather information such as which version of the application you are using, your screen resolution, the type of operating system you have and your device model and manufacturer.  This information helps us provide a mobile experience that matches your device and also helps us calculate usage levels of the App, diagnose problems, ensure that the App functions properly and otherwise administer the App.</p>
<p>Some mobile applications will utilize analytic tools to help us better serve our users through improved products, services, and revisions to the mobile applications.  This collected information does not identify you to MSSB.  It may, however let us know anonymously, which services and features you are using the most within the application, as well as device type and hardware features, country and language of download.</p>
