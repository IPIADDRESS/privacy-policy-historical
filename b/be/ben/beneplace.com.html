<p>Beneplace is strongly committed to respecting the privacy of all persons using this website (“Site”), and the protection of any personal information which we may collect and which you may choose to share with us. Such personal information will be used in accordance with the disclosures in this Privacy Statement, which is part of and incorporated into the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.beneplace.com/terms.htm">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>&nbsp;of this Site.</p>
<p>Exclusive Disclosures Pertaining to Use of Personal Information. Please note that this Privacy Statement pertains exclusively to information which you provide to us in the course of your use and access of the Site, and does not alter or affect the terms and conditions of any other agreement that you may have or enter into with any Beneplace entity for any given product or service. The latter agreement will continue to govern that specific legal relationship with Beneplace. However, some pages on this Site or areas of this Site with restricted access (“Secured Sites”, including project extranets or sites engaged in e-commerce) or in foreign locations may require the application of additional or special privacy disclosures, which will be posted on the home page of that Site.</p>
<p>Your Express Consent to Collection and Use of Information. If you do not agree with any disclosure in this Privacy Statement, or have any questions, please do not access the Site. Contact us directly at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@beneplace.com">info@beneplace.com</a>, and we will be pleased to assist you. BY CHOOSING TO PROCEED AND ACCESS THE SITE, YOU ARE INDICATING YOUR EXPRESS CONSENT AND AGREEMENT TO THE COLLECTION, TRANSFER, HANDLING, PROCESSING, USE AND STORAGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED FROM YOU DURING YOUR VISIT TO OUR SITE, ANY OF WHICH MAY OCCUR BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES OR THE EUROPEAN UNION IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE LEGAL PROTECTIONS MAY BE LESS STRINGENT. You grant Beneplace, its affiliates, and third party providers a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free perpetual license to use your personal information for the purposes disclosed herein.</p>

When you visit and use this Site, we may obtain various types of information (such as your name and contact information) from you that (1) you may directly provide to us (by inputting information through various interactive features, filling out registrations, submitting inquiries, placing orders, etc.) or (2) that we will automatically collect during your visit to the site (such as your user identification and password, internet domain or IP address) as part of our normal operation.</p>
<p>How We Will Use Your Information. Your personal information will be stored in our systems for our internal use only. We will use such information to provide you with the requested information, goods, services or materials, for internal research, for marketing and data analysis, to send you updates and news concerning Beneplace and its business partners, and to better assist you with any future requirements.

Cookies will not be used to track your activities outside of the Site or for any purpose not disclosed herein.</p>
<p>You may elect not to accept “cookies” by setting your Internet options on your computer; however, please be advised that in that case, you may not be able to access part or all of this Site, or parts of this Site may not operate effectively.</p>

Due to the numerous technical and operational uncertainties, we cannot make any warranty, guarantee or representation concerning the accuracy, thoroughness, completeness, or currency of your information, nor over our ability to control, correct, access, handle, process, use, store or transfer such information, and all such warranties are hereby disclaimed.</p>
<p>Changes to Privacy Statement. Since we are constantly making changes and upgrades to our systems and services in order to better serve you, the way we manage your personal information may change. Therefore, we anticipate updating this Privacy Statement from time-to-time. We reserve the right to revise the content of this Privacy Statement in any manner and at any time; without notice, however we will note the date of revision. It is your responsibility to check the Site each time prior to access for any changes.</p>
