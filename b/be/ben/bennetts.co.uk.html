We also reserve the right to transfer our rights under this Agreement at any time.</p> </li> <li> <h3>How will we use your data?</h3> <p>The following paragraphs set out in detail how your data will be used by us.</p> </li> <li> <h3>Claims &amp; Underwriting Exchange Register</h3> <p>Insurers pass information to the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register run by Insurance Database Services Limited (IDS Ltd), the Hunter Database, run by MCL Software Ltd and the Motor Insurance Anti Fraud and Theft Register, run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) to help us check information provided and also to prevent fraudulent claims. When we deal with your request for insurance, we may search these Registers and any other relevant registers. Under the conditions of your policy, you must tell us about any incident (such as an accident or theft) which may give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass this information to the Registers and to any other relevant registers. You can ask us for more information about this.</p> </li> <li> <h3>Motor Insurance Database</h3> <p>Information relating to your insurance policy will be added to the Motor Insurance Database ("MID") managed by the Motor Insurers’ Bureau ("MIB").</p> <p>MID and the data stored on it may be used by certain statutory and/or authorised bodies including the Police, the DVLA, the DVLANI, the Insurance Fraud Bureau and other bodies permitted by law for purposes not limited to but including :&nbsp;</p> <p>i. Electronic Licensing</p> <p>ii. Continuous Insurance Enforcement</p> <p>iii. Law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and or prosecution of offenders)</p> <p>iv. The provision of government services and or other services aimed at reducing the level and incidence of uninsured driving.</p> <p>If you are involved in a road traffic accident (either in the UK, the EEA or certain other territories), insurers and or the MIB may search the MID to obtain relevant information.</p> <p>Persons (including his or her appointed representatives) pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID.</p> <p>It is vital that the MID holds your correct registration number. If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your vehicle seized by the Police.</p> <p>You can check that your correct registration number details are shown on the MID at <a href="http://www.askmid.com">www.askmid.com</a></p> </li> <li> <h3>Insurance Administration, Renewal and Claims Handling</h3> <p>Information you supply may be used for the purpose of insurance administration, renewal and claims handling by the insurer, its agents, re-insurers and your intermediary. In assessing any claims made, insurers may undertake checks against publicly available information such as Electoral Register, County Court Judgments, bankruptcy or repossession information. Information may also be shared with other insurers either directly or via those acting for the insurer such as Loss Adjusters or investigators.</p> </li> <li> <h3>Marketing and Market Research</h3> <p>BISL Limited, part of the BGL group of companies, which also trades as Dial Direct and Budget and other carefully selected companies may use your information to keep you informed by post, telephone, e-mail or other means of products and services which may be of interest to you.

They may keep a record of that search. We may also pass to Credit Reference Agencies information we hold about you and your payment record with us. Credit Reference Agencies share information with other organisations, enabling applications for financial products to be assessed or to assist the tracing of debtors, or to prevent fraud. We may ask Credit Reference Agencies to provide a credit scoring computation. Credit scoring uses a number of factors to work out risks involved in any application. A score is given to each factor and a total score obtained and this together with other factors will be used to accept or reject your application.</p> </li> <li> <h3>Sensitive Personal Data</h3> <p>In order to assess the terms of the insurance contract or administer claims, we will need to collect personal data which the Data Protection Act 1998 defines as sensitive, such as medical history or criminal convictions.
