			<a name="p03"></a><h3 class="official">3. How will we use your data?</h3>
			<p>The following paragraphs set out in detail how your data will be used by us.</p>
			<div class="top"><a href="#top">to the top</a></div>
			
			<a name="p04"></a><h3 class="official">4. Claims &amp; Underwriting Exchange Register</h3>
			<p>Insurers pass information to the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register run by Insurance Database Services Limited (IDS Ltd), the Hunter Database, run by MCL Software Ltd and the Motor Insurance Anti Fraud and Theft Register, run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) to help us check information provided and also to prevent fraudulent claims.  When we deal with your request for insurance, we may search these Registers and any other relevant registers.  Under the conditions of your policy, you must tell us about any incident (such as an accident or theft) which may give rise to a claim.  When you tell us about an incident, we will pass this information to the Registers and to any other relevant registers.  You can ask us for more information about this.</p>
			<div class="top"><a href="#top">to the top</a></div>
			
			<a name="p05"></a><h3 class="official">5. Motor Insurance Database</h3>
			<p>Your motorcycle insurance policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID), run by the Motor Insurers' Information Centre (MIIC). MID data may be used by the DVLA and DVLNI for the purpose of Electronic Vehicle Licensing and by the Police for the purposes of establishing whether a driver's use of the vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor insurance policy and/or for preventing and detecting crime. If you are involved in an accident (in the UK or abroad), other UK insurers, the Motor Insurers' Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to obtain relevant car insurance policy information.</p>
			<p>Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID.</p>
			<p>You can find out more about this from us, or at <a href="http://www.miic.org.uk" target="_blank">www.miic.org.uk</a></p>
			<div class="top"><a href="#top">to the top</a></div>
			
			<a name="p06"></a><h3 class="official">6. Insurance Administration, Renewal and Claims Handling</h3>
			<p>Information you supply may be used for the purpose of insurance administration, renewal and claims handling by the insurer, its agents, re-insurers and your intermediary.  In assessing any claims made, insurers may undertake checks against publicly available information such as Electoral Register, County Court Judgments, bankruptcy or repossession information.  Information may also be shared with other insurers either directly or via those acting for the insurer such as Loss Adjusters or investigators.</p>
			<div class="top"><a href="#top">to the top</a></div>
			
			<a name="p07"></a><h3 class="official">7. Marketing and Market Research</h3>
			<p>BISL Limited, part of the Budget Group of Companies, which also trades as Dial Direct and Budget and other carefully selected companies may use your information to keep you informed by post, telephone, e-mail or other means of products and services which may be of interest to you.

			 <a name="p08"></a><h3 class="official">8. Credit Searches</h3>
			 <p>In assessing your application/renewal, we may search files made available to us by Credit Reference Agencies.  They may keep a record of that search.  We may also pass to Credit Reference Agencies information we hold about you and your payment record with us.  Credit Reference Agencies share information with other organisations, enabling applications for financial products to be assessed or to assist the tracing of debtors, or to prevent fraud.  We may ask Credit Reference Agencies to provide a credit scoring computation.  Credit scoring uses a number of factors to work out risks involved in any application.  A score is given to each factor and a total score obtained and this together with other factors will be used to accept or reject your application.</p>
