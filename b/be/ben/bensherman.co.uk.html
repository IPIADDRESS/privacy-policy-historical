<p>We work with a variety of advertising companies to place our ads on websites across the Internet.&nbsp; These advertising companies collect anonymous information about your visits to our website, other advertising websites or interaction with our email through the use of cookies.&nbsp; This technology allows them to develop Ben Sherman advertising and marketing about goods and offers that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Security</b> <br> We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your online order information as it is transmitted over the Internet. &nbsp;&nbsp;To make sure you are accessing our server in a secure manner, before you submit personal financial information, look at the lower right-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the "Address" line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." <br> <br> If for any reason you are unable to connect to the server, or if you are not quite comfortable shopping online at any of our websites, please feel free to place your order with us by calling Customer Care at&nbsp; 1-800-811-5868. <br> <br> Identity thieves sometimes send fraudulent email messages to trick customers into divulging personal or financial information (a practice known as "phishing"). &nbsp;If you receive an email that looks like it is from us asking for your personal information, do not respond.&nbsp; We never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through email.&nbsp; If you have received or entered personal information in response to a suspicious email, pop-up or phony website claiming to be affiliated with Ben Sherman or its affiliates, please email us at customercare@bensherman.com.</p>
