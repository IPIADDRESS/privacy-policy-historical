<h2><a name="Personal Data"></a><span style="font-size: large;">Where we store your personal data</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Our email campaigns are provided through Mailchimp, a service operated by Rocket Science Group LLC based in the United States. Email addresses and other profile information provided by you may be disclosed to Rocket Science Group LLC for the sole purpose of operating email campaigns on our behalf. Rocket Science Group LLC complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework as specified by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.
