                           As a leader in toolbar technology, BenefitBar understands your desire to protect personal information. We intend to inform you of how your
                           personal information will be gathered, tracked or used, and to give you choices.

                        <p>
                          We request personal information when you correspond with us or engage in certain other activities on our Web site. For example, if you request
                          technical support online, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction, such as your confirmation number and
                          information about your computer hardware, software and the nature of the problem you are experiencing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         You make the decision whether to proceed with any activity that requests personal information. If you do not wish to provide the requested
                         information, however, you may not be able to complete the transaction.

                           BenefitBar may retain the services of outside contractors to provide services for us. They may be used to provide technical support or handle
                           order processing. We require that these contractors keep the personal information of customers secure and confidential. We also require that
                           these contractors use personal information only on behalf of BenefitBar.
                        </p>
