or amended from time to time (collectively, the "Sites").</p>

<p>Because many users of our Site are children, we take care that the content of the Sites are
suitable for children and that we take appropriate measures to help children protect their privacy
online. This Privacy Policy outlines and clarifies how we collect and use information online, our
advertising policies and the safeguards we recommend to ensure a fun and safe web experience.
We employ special measures to help children protect their privacy while online. We do not ask
children to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate in a
particular activity, and we take steps to prevent children from posting contact information. As new
technology and online standards evolve, we may modify these policies to better address your
concerns.</p>

<h3>1. Data Collection</h3>

<p>Turner Entertainment Network Asia, Inc. ("Turner", "we" or "us") does
not collect any personally identifiable information from its visitors without the person being aware
that they are providing the information. Instead, personal information, such as names and e-mail addresses,
is obtained only during the registration process and when Site users fill out contest entry forms, subscribe to
newsletters, contact us via e-mail, participate in message boards, chat rooms, profile pages,
social community environments or otherwise voluntarily provide this information to us.</p>

<p>We may use or disclose personal information if we reasonably believe that the use or disclosure
is necessary to prevent improper conduct or a breach of law, or if its use or disclosure is required
or authorised by law, or in response to a law enforcement agency's or other public agency's
(including schools or children services) request or if we feel that such disclosure may prevent the
instigation of a crime. Finally, we may disclose information to a prospective purchaser of our
company (or its assets), to the extent permitted by law.</p>

<p>In all other circumstances, we will use personally identifiable information only for the purpose for
which it is provided. Under no circumstances will we sell or otherwise disclose personal
information to any third party. We may also ask for a parental email address for children under
the age of 14 who register in order to try and provide notice to the parent or guardian that his or
her child would like to participate in registration for certain features (such as newsletters). We
make all reasonable efforts to give notice via e-mail to parents or guardians of children under the
age of 14 when we collect information (e-mail addresses or any other information) from their
child. For Site users over 14 years of age, we may collect information, with your permission, that
will be used to improve your experience on the Site (e.g., online surveys). You may ask us at any
time to let you know what personal information we have collected from you or your child (aged
under 14 years). On your request, we will amend any such information we are holding that is
incorrect or delete such information.</p>

<p>We may transfer personal information and store it outside of the jurisdiction in which a Site user is
located and, although such personal information will be protected by the security measures
described in this privacy policy, it will be also be subject to local laws. We will not use or transfer
personally identifiable information in ways that are materially different from the ones described
above without also providing notice to our Site users (and/or their parents/guardians).</p>

<p>We also may collect some non-personally identifiable information such as the current Internet
protocol address and the type of computer operating system they are using (e.g., Microsoft
Windows, Mac OS, Linux), the type of browser they are using (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer),
the domain name of the Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink), their activities
while visiting our Sites, their activities while playing games or utilizing services on our Sites (e.g.,
which of our Web pages you viewed or which games you played), and the advertisements they
have been shown.</p>

<p>We have systems and procedures in place to safeguard, and help prevent unauthorised access
to or use of, the information we collect online and to maintain data security.</p>

<h3>2. Online Payment Terms</h3>

<p>Visitors who order merchandise or other materials from the Sites or participate in certain
interactive features may be required to provide their full name, billing and mailing addresses, e-
mail address, telephone number and a credit card number. If an order is being shipped to a third
party, we will also need the recipient.s name and mailing address. Before collecting information
in connection with an e-commerce order, we will verify the validity of the purchaser.s credit card.
On occasion, we might solicit additional voluntary information regarding shoppers. personal
shopping preferences.</p>

<p>Some Sites may offer PayPal for online payment transactions. When you use PayPal, your
financial information is not shared with Turner and such financial information will be subject to
PayPal.s privacy policy, which can be found here: https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-
bin/marketingweb?cmd=_render-content&amp;content_ID=ua/Privacy_full&amp;locale.x=en_US.</p>

<p>We use sophisticated encryption technology and secure servers to keep your personal
information (including your name, email and mailing address, phone number, credit card
information and purchase history) safe. All your ordering information is protected during
transmission by using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which encrypts the information that you
input so it can't be read in transit. In addition, the customer data we collect is protected against
unauthorized access. We may contact you to verify the accuracy of the information supplied when
opening your account.</p>

<p>These Sites store customer information (name, address, order information, etc.) on dedicated
secure servers to protect against unauthorized access. We also encrypt all data during
transmission to further safeguard your interests.</p>

<h3>3. How We Use the Information</h3>

<p>We strive to create imaginative online contests and promotions. We do this because, well, it's fun.
By registering on the Site and establishing an account, you acknowledge that we will conduct
these contests and promotions and, if applicable, your parent or guardian acknowledges that you
will be entitled to participate in such contests or promotions. Once a contest winner has been
selected, that person will be contacted via the winner's e-mail address given at the time of entry.
If the e-mail address has changed or been deleted or is no longer operational, the entry will
become void. We will not be held responsible for invalid e-mail addresses.</p>

<p>We do not continue to retain any personal information we obtain through a contest or
sweepstakes unless we have successfully selected a winner(s), awarded the prize(s), and
administered the contest or sweepstakes. We only use the e-mail addresses of subscribers to
our Sites. e-mail newsletters to send them the requested newsletter(s). Each newsletter also
includes instructions for subscription removal via return e-mail.</p>

<p>We will use reasonable efforts to contact parents or guardians via e-mail to notify when we have
received personal information such as e-mail addresses from their children and to give parents
the option of removing the child's e-mail address from the list of entries. We will not use a parent's
or guardian.s e-mail address for any other purpose. We will remove a parent's or their child's
details from our database within 72 hours of any request from that parent. Sometimes we may
also require a Site user to provide us additional information that is not personally identifiable. For
example, we might ask you to tell us your favourite character or answer a trivia question.</p>

<p>We never sell, rent, or otherwise share our visitors' personal information with third parties without
appropriate consent, though we may use agents or contractors to provide services to our visitors,
such as helping us conduct sweepstakes, sending prizes to winners, shipping customer orders
made on the Sites or providing customer service related to activities on the Sites. In these cases,
we require the agent or contractor to keep the information confidential and to use it only for the
specific services they are performing. We may on occasion combine information we collect
through our Sites with information that we collect from other sources. We sometimes use non-
personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our Sites,
and to improve our visitors' experience on the Sites. We also may aggregate, use and share this
information with third parties to analyze Site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or
services.</p>

<p>We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in
response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may use and disclose such information in
response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary to
investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations
involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, to
verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Sites and applicable laws, or as
otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements. In addition, we may
transfer personally identifiable information about you if we or one of our business units are
acquired by, sold to, or merged with another entity.</p>

<p>We will not use or transfer personally identifiable information in ways that are materially different
from the ones described above without also providing appropriatel notification of such practices
and obtaining consent for any materially different uses.</p>

<h3>4. Voluntary Submissions Via E-mail</h3>

<p>We enjoy interacting with our audience. Therefore, there will be opportunities for Site users to
contact us online. In these areas, an e-mail address will be collected and, in some cases, you
may receive a response.</p>

<p>In addition, sometimes you will have the choice to select the option to subscribe to a free online
newsletter sent to the e-mail address you provide. The newsletter will have fun, informative
updates about the Site. We will only provide our newsletter to a child under 14 years of age with
consent from their parent or guardian. The parent/guardian can request at any time to delete their
child's e-mail address from the newsletter subscription list. In addition, each time the newsletter is
e-mailed, directions will clearly be stated how to remove oneself from the e-mail newsletter list.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances will your e-mail address be provided to any third parties.</p>

<h3>5. Cookies: the Non-Edible Kind</h3>

<p>Cookies are tiny pieces of information that your browser stores on your computer, such as what
browser you're using or what operating system you use.</p>

<p>We use cookies to help make your experience better and understand how well we're doing. We
only use cookies so that we know how many visitors we have and how often they visit: that's the
best way to know if you like what we're doing. Under no circumstances do we use cookies to
collect or cross-relate personal information about you.</p>

<h3>6. Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers and Sponsors</h3>

<p>Our Sites contain links to other Web sites, including those of sponsors and advertisers, whose
information practices may be different from ours. Sometimes these third party Web sites might
conduct contests or sweepstakes that are promoted on our Sites. Visitors should consult those
other third party Web sites' privacy notices, since those Web sites are not covered by our Privacy
Statement and may follow different procedures.</p>

<p>Additionally, we and our advertisers may use third parties to serve or present the ads that appear
on our site and to conduct research about the advertisements. These third parties may use their
own cookies. We, our third party service providers and/or partners may also place cookies, web
beacons, clear .gifs or similar technologies to help present advertisements on Sites, and to help
measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness. The use of these technologies by these
third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Statement.

<p>Turner operates globally so it may be necessary to transfer any information provided to these
Sites internationally. In particular, the information provided will likely be transferred to and
processed in the United States, United Kingdom or Hong Kong where many of our central
databases operate. The data protection and other laws of other countries may not be as
comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that we take reasonable steps to
ensure that your privacy is protected in case of such transfer, and that your data continues to be
used as set forth in this Privacy Policy where practicable.</p>

educated on the various Internet and software tools available so as to ensure that their child has

that information or request the deletion of this information, please contact us at the mailing
