	 <p>Benny Hinn Ministries (“the Ministries”) is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. The following statement explains the Ministries’  policy
	   regarding any personal information you may supply on the Ministries Web site. This privacy policy also discloses how the Ministry collects, protects, uses, and shares information gathered about you on the Ministries Web site. This Statement of Privacy
	   applies to the Ministries Web site and governs data collection and usage. By using the Ministries Web site, you signify your acceptance of the terms of the Ministries’  privacy policy.</p>
     <br>
	 <p><b>Collection of Your Personal Information</b></p>
	<p>You can use the Ministries Web site without divulging any personally identifiable information, including your e-mail address. This Web site does not collect personally identifiable information about you, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work
	address, or telephone number, except when you specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis, such as when registering at the Ministries Web site, or requesting material from it. When possible, the Ministries also collects anonymous demographic
	information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests, and favorites.</p>
<p>There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by the Ministries. This information can include your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and referring Web site addresses. This information
is used by the Ministries for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding how the Ministries Web site is used. The Ministries uses such identifiable information collected to continually
improve the content of its Web site and to offer its visitors products and services that best meet their preferences, needs, or desires. In so using this information, the Ministries is able to refine their Web site and enhance the benefits it offers.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through the Ministries’ public message boards, this information may be collected and used by other users outside the control of the
Ministries. Please be advised that the Ministries cannot interfere with or otherwise limit the use of such personal information when provided on public forums. Note: the Ministries does not read any of your private online communications.</p>
<p>The Ministries encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites to which you choose to link from the Ministries so you can understand how those Web sites collect, use, and share your information. The Ministries are not responsible for the
privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside the Ministries and the Ministries’ family of Web sites.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Use of Your Personal Information</b></p>

<p>The Ministries collects and uses your personal information to operate the Ministries Web site and deliver the services you have requested. The Ministries also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available
from the Ministries and its affiliates. The Ministries may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.</p>

<p>In the ordinary course of its operations, the Ministries does not sell, rent, or lease its customer lists to third parties. There are occasions in which the Ministries might undertake one of these activities, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Privacy Policy. The Ministries may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In addition, the Ministries may retain the services of a third party vendor to assist
it as it attempts to determine whether an individual desires to be retained on the Ministries’ mailing list or whether that individual might be better served by another service or entity. Be assured that in those cases, your unique personally identifiable
information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is never transferred to the third party. In addition, the Ministries may share data with trusted partners to help it perform statistical analyses, send you e-mail or postal mail, provide customer support,
or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information in any way or for any purpose except to provide these services to the Ministries, and they are required to at all times maintain the confidentiality
of your information.</p>

<p>The Ministries does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.</p>

<p>The Ministries keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within the Ministries in order to determine which of the Ministries’ services are most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within the
Ministries to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area and for no other purpose.</p>

<p>Please be advised that the Ministries Web sites will only disclose your personal information without notice if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal
process served on the Ministries or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of the Ministries; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Ministries or the public.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Use of Cookies</b></p>

<p>The Ministries Web site uses “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can be read only by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>

<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize the Ministries’  pages or register
with the Ministries’ site or services, a cookie helps the Ministries recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This allows the Ministries to deliver messages and material more specific to your needs and to simplify the process of recording
your personal information, such as your billing address, shipping address, and so on. When you return to the same Ministries Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved so you can easily use the Ministries’ features that you
customized.</p>

<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience
the many valuable interactive features of the Ministries’ services or Web sites you visit.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Security of Your Personal Information</b></p>

<p>The Ministries makes every effort to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The Ministries protects the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected
from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Changes to This Statement</b></p>

<p>The Ministries will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. The Ministries encourages you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how the Ministries is protecting your right to privacy and
your information.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Contact Information</b></p>

<p>The Ministries welcomes your comments regarding this Statement of Privacy. If you believe that the Ministries has not adhered to this statement, please contact the Ministries at <a href="mailto:inforequest@imail.bennyhinn.org">inforequest@imail.bennyhinn.org</a>.
We will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and remedy the problem.</p>
