	<h1>Legal Disclaimers and Privacy Policy</h1>
	<h2>Disclosure</h2>
<p>I maintain affiliate relationships with several companies. Most of these are programs that I have used and love. When I do not love the program, I say so. What this means is that when I write about a program or product I love and include a link, I get a commission, which helps support this site.</p>
<p>Sometimes a company compensates me (usually in the form of a gift card) to write a post about something I find interesting or useful. When that happens, I mention that I have been compensated at the end of the post. I do write about companies I am affiliated with, but my opinions are always truthful. I try to include the positives and negatives of any products I write about. If you have any questions about the above companies, feel free to contact me with any questions. I’d be glad to discuss them with you.</p>
<p>I also run paid ads in my sidebar. Some ads are affiliate ads for companies I love. I hand pick these ads, because they’re companies and products I personally use. All other ads like Google Adsense are random, and I do not endorse them.</p>
<h2>Policies</h2>
<h3>Comment Policy</h3>
<p>I enjoy comments, good discussion, and alternative viewpoints. You are always welcome to leave a comment if you have something to add to the conversation, a question to ask, or even a viewpoint different than my own. However, I do ask that you be respectful in voicing your opinions, both to me and to other commentators. I reserve the right to remove any comments that are obviously meant to be inflammatory or comments that are spam.</p>
<h3>Link Exchange Policy</h3>
<p>I do not participate in link exchanges. I do not have time to respond to emails requesting link exchanges. I’m sorry.</p>

<p>The privacy of our visitors to beingfrugal.net is important to us. At beingfrugal.net, we recognize that privacy of your personal information is important.

<p>I'm just an average mom, trying to live a frugal life and get out of debt. I write about things that have (and haven't) worked to improve my family's financial situation. What works for me may or may not work for you, and you should always consult a financial advisor before making important financial decisions.</p>

<p>In accordance with FTC guidelines, I state that I have a financial relationship with companies mentioned in this website. This may include receiving access to free products and services for product and service reviews and giveaways.</p>

<p>Any references to third party products, rates, or websites are subject to change without notice. I do my best to maintain current information, but due to the rapidly changing environment, some information may have changed since it was published.
