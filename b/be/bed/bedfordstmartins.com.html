<p><b><a name="infoWeCollect">Information We Collect</a></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b><a name="examCopies">Examination Copies</a></b></p>
  <p>Instructors may request examination copies of textbooks and some supplements 
    from our Web sites.&nbsp; Instructors may also request preview access to password-protected 
    areas of our Web sites.&nbsp; In order to fulfill these requests, we will need 
    to collect information that will allow us to confirm your instructor status.&nbsp; 
    This may include information such as your name, e-mail address, telephone 
    number, the school at which you teach, your course and the book or product 
    you are using in it.</p>
  <p><b><a name="adoptInstructor">Adopting Instructor Support</a></b></p>
  <p>We offer a number of Web-based products and services to adopting instructors.&nbsp; 
    A user account is necessary to get support for these products and services.&nbsp; 
    To create a user account, you will need to enter your name and e-mail address.&nbsp; 
    You will also need to establish a password of your choosing.&nbsp; We may require 
    additional information to confirm your status as an adopting instructor, e.g., 
    your school name and location, course information, including the textbook 
    you are using, and a telephone number where we can contact you.&nbsp; In addition, 
    you may choose to provide optional information (e.g., your areas of interest), 
    which will allow us to serve you better.</p>
  <p><b><a name="studentGrades">Student Grades and Work</a></b></p>
  <p>Many of our Web sites allow students to do and save work over the Internet 
    (e.g., iSolve, Comment, and exercises and quizzes on our book-specific Web 
    sites).&nbsp; Both instructors and students create user accounts by entering their 
    name and e-mail address, and establishing a password.&nbsp; Each student generally 
    has access to his or her own work or scores only; instructors can only access 
    work or scores of students in their courses.&nbsp; In some instances, however, 
    instructors may have the ability to require students to work collaboratively, 
    in which case students may be able to view, and in some instances comment 
    upon, the work of others.</p>
  <p>Protection of information entered by students on such sites is controlled 
    by password systems that depend upon both instructors and students keeping 
    their passwords secure.&nbsp; In the event that providing technical or user support 
    requires accessing student work to diagnose or fix the problem, BFW will only 
    take that step with permission from the student and/or instructor involved.</p>
  <p><b><a name="sweepstakes">Sweepstakes, Contests and Other Promotions</a></b></p>
  <p>From time to time we may run sweepstakes, contests or other promotions on 
    our Web sites.&nbsp; If you choose to participate, we may request your contact 
    and other information in connection with the promotion.</p>
  <p><b><a name="surveys">Surveys and Questionnaires</a></b></p>
  <p>We may ask visitors to our Web sites to complete online surveys and opinion 
    polls on a variety of topics, such as their activities, attitudes, and interests, 
    and our products and services.&nbsp; These surveys help us understand the needs 
    of our visitors.</p>
  <p><b><a name="chatRooms">Chat Rooms, Forums, Blogs and Discussion Groups</a></b></p>
  <p>We may host chat rooms, forums, blogs and/or discussion groups (including 
    by e-mail, bulletin board, instant messaging or other technologies) on our 
    own or on third-party Web sites.&nbsp; If you choose to participate in a chat room, 
    forum, blog or discussion group, we may request certain information such as 
    your e-mail address, date of birth, academic status and affiliation, and other 
    pertinent information.&nbsp; Please be aware that some or all the information you 
    provide (including personally identifiable information such as your name) 
    in connection with a chat room, forum, blog or discussion group may be available 
    to specific groups or to the public generally, depending upon the technologies 
    used.</p>
  <p><b><a name="contactAndTechSupport">“Contact Us” and Technical Support</a></b></p>
  <p>You may choose to contact us through our Web site.&nbsp; If you e-mail us comments 
    or questions, we will have your e-mail address, as well as any other information 
    you choose to provide.</p>
  <p><b><a name="send">Send This Page to a Friend</a></b></p>
  <p>You may choose to use our “Send This Page to a Friend” service, which lets 
    you send either a copy of the page or selected content from it, or the URL 
    for that page, to people you believe will find the information useful.&nbsp; These 
    services will require you to enter the e-mail address(es) of the intended 
    recipient(s). In these instances, the e-mail addresses provided will not be 
    added to any marketing or outreach database.&nbsp; They will be counted and studied 
    in aggregate to look for broad trends, but then deleted from the “Send a Page 
    to a Friend” dataset.&nbsp; However, such addresses may already be in our databases 
    from some other source.</p>
  <p><b><a name="buying">Buying our Products</a></b></p>
  <p>We sometimes offer our books and other products for sale on-line directly 
    to students. In order to make a purchase in this way, you will need to register 
    directly with PayPal, a third-party service provider we use to process the 
    purchase. When you do this, you will be their customer as well as ours, and 
    use of your information by PayPal will be governed by their privacy policy, 
    as well as by ours.</p>
  <p><b><a name="cookies">Cookies</a></b></p>
  <p>We use cookies on our Web sites (including the companion Web sites for some 
    of our books), to help us administer certain site features (such as the <i>Comment</i> 
    system). Cookies are small text files that Web sites often store on the computer 
    hard drives of visitors to their sites.&nbsp; A cookie contains a unique code, 
    which is used to recognize a computer when a user of that computer returns 
    to a Web site that was visited previously. The "help" portion of 
    the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, 
    how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing 
    cookies.&nbsp; However, in order to use certain features of our Web sites, users 
    must have the “cookie” function on their browsers enabled.</p>
  <p><b><a name="collection">Other Passive Collection of Information</a></b></p>
  <p>When you visit our Web site, your browser automatically sends us certain 
    Internet-related information, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of 
    the computer you’re using and your originating domain.</p>
  <p>We also use log files to collect certain aggregate information about Web 
    site use, such as how many users visited our site, the average time spent 
    on the site and the pages viewed.&nbsp; By collecting this information, we learn 
    how best to tailor our Web sites to our visitors.&nbsp; While we generally examine 
    such information only in the aggregate, such information could be linked back 
    to individual IP addresses.&nbsp; In addition, if you are a registered user of 
    one of our Web sites, this information will be associated with your user name 
    or id.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="right"><a href="#top">return to top</a></p>
<p><b><a name="howWeUseInfo"></a>How We Use Information We Collect</b></p>
<p>Information collected through our Web sites is 
  used in connection with the purpose for which it was submitted (for example, 
  to contact you if you win a sweepstakes or contest, to allow you to participate 
  in a chat room, to contact you with an answer to a question, or to send you 
  information or a product you’ve requested).</p>
<p>We may also contact you as a user of one of our 
  products to:&nbsp; ask you to serve as a reviewer; to request an appointment with 
  you at your campus or at a conference to talk about an existing or planned product; 
  and other similar kinds of feedback and discussion.&nbsp; We may also use the information 
  we collect to send you information or products we think may be of interest to 
  you, and to customize our contacts with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Finally, we may use some of the information we collect to analyze Web site 
  use and to do other internal analyses, such as market research, that will allow 
  us to better meet the needs of our customers.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top">return to top</a></p>
<p><b><a name="infoWeShare">Information We Share</a></b></p>
<p>We do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose 
  personal information about our Web site visitors, except as described here.&nbsp; 
  If we describe more limited sharing practices in connection with your use of 
  a specific product or service anywhere on our Web sites, those more limited 
  practices will apply as to that product or service only. We may share the information 
  you provide with companies that are related to BFW through common ownership.&nbsp; 
  We also share information provided by our Web site visitors with service providers 
  we have retained to perform services on our behalf.&nbsp; In addition, we may share 
  information about you with non-affiliated third parties whose products or services 
  may be of interest to you.&nbsp; These third parties may contact you about their 
  products and services.&nbsp; We will not share your information with these third 
  parties for their own marketing purposes if you request that we not do so.&nbsp; 
  We may, however, engage in joint marketing activities, such as contests or promotions, 
  with selected third parties and may share personal information about our Web 
  site visitors with them.&nbsp; In addition, we may disclose information about you 
  (i) if we are required to do so by law, (ii) in response to legal process, (iii) 
  to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iv) when we 
  believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial 
  loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.<b> 
  </b></p>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer any information 
  we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business 
  or assets.&nbsp; Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts 
  to try to ensure that the transferee uses personal information you have provided 
  through this Web site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top">return to top</a></p>
<p><b><a name="links">Links to Other Web sites</a></b></p>
<p>We provide links to other Web sites for your convenience.&nbsp; 
  Also, on occasion, we may provide to a department, program, class or instructor 
  access to a third-party Web site (which may also include access to third-party 
  software). These sites may operate independently from BFW, and may not be under 
  our control.&nbsp; These sites may have their own privacy notices in place, which 
  we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked Web sites.&nbsp; We may not 
  be responsible for the content of these sites, any products or services that 
  may be offered through these sites, or the privacy practices of these sites.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top">return to top</a></p>
<p><b><a name="security">Security</a></b></p>
<p>We use administrative, technical and physical safeguards 
  to protect information in our possession and control against foreseeable hazards.&nbsp; 
  Please note, however, that perfect security does not exist on the Internet.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top">return to top</a></p>
<p><b><a name="marketing">Your Choices About Marketing</a></b></p>
<p>We give you the option of requesting that we not share personal information 
  about you with third parties that are unrelated by common ownership with BFW 
  for marketing use.&nbsp; <a href="mailto:optout@bfpwub.com?subject=Do%20not%20share%20my%20personal%20information%20with%20unrelated%20third%20parties">Click 
  here</a> if you DO NOT want us to share your personal information with unrelated 
  third parties for their own marketing use.</p>
<p>We also give you the option of requesting that we not share your information 
  with companies related to BFW by common ownership for marketing use.&nbsp; However, 
  PLEASE NOTE that, because of the integrated nature of the businesses of BFW 
  and some of these companies, if you opt out of sharing with them, you will also 
  automatically be opted out of marketing use by BFW.&nbsp; That means that you will 
  not receive information about books, new products, promotions and services from 
  BFW.&nbsp; <a href="mailto:optout@bfwpub.com?subject=Do%20not%20share%20my%20personal%20information%20with%20any%20affiliated%20parties">Click 
  here</a> if you do not want us to share your information with related companies 
  for marketing use (or use the information for marketing purposes ourselves). 
  (Keep in mind, however, that some of our related companies may have independently 
  obtained your information, in which case you may continue to receive communications 
  from those companies, unless you opt out directly with them.)</p>
<p>Please be aware that we are able to effectuate 
  an opt-out only for a specific e-mail address, or for a name and address or 
  other identifying information. For example, we are unable to opt out “John Smith” 
  by name alone, because of the large number of persons by that name in our databases. 
  So, if you have more than one e-mail address, if you move or change jobs, or 
  if the information you provide us when opting out doesn’t match the information 
  in our databases, your opt out request may not be effectuated properly. If you 
  believe you have opted out, but continue to receive e-mails from us, please 
  contact us by one of the means listed under “How to Contact Us”, below, and 
  we will endeavor to resolve the issue.</p>
