<h2>4. Cookies and Online Data Collection Tools</h2>
<p>When you visit our website or use our mobile applications, we collect certain Transaction Information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, browser analysis tools, server logs and web beacons.  In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is only used in a non-identifiable way, without any reference to Personal Information.  For example, we use information we collect about all website users to optimize our websites and to understand website traffic patterns.</p>
<p>In some cases, we do associate the information we collect using cookies and other technology with your Personal Information.  This Privacy Notice governs how we use that information when we associate it with your Personal Information.</p>
<h3><em>Cookies</em></h3>
<p>A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. For more information on cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at www.allaboutcookies.org.

<p>Our Sites use two kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open. Once you close your browser, they are deleted. Persistent cookies, in contrast, last beyond each visit to the Sites and remain on your hard drive after you close your browser. The cookies used on the Sites include those that are strictly necessary cookies for access and navigation, cookies that track usage (performance cookies) and remember your choices (functionality cookies), and for visitors to our catalog and store Sites, cookies that provide you with targeted content or advertising (described more below under “Interest Based Advertising”). Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Please note however, that without cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features of our Sites.</p>
<p>We may use the information we obtain from cookies for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>to recognize your computer when you visit the Sites;</li>
    <li>to track you as you navigate the Sites, and to enable the use of e-commerce capabilities;</li>
    <li>to improve the Sites’ usability;</li>
    <li>to analyze use of the Sites;</li>
    <li>to manage the Sites;</li>
    <li>to personalize the Sites, including for visitors to our catalog and store Sites;</li>
    <li>to enable targeted advertisements that may be of particular interest to you (excluding Students); and</li>
    <li>to recognize you when you move between devices so that your work can be synchronized.</li>
</ul>
<h3><em>Flash Cookies</em></h3>
<p>We may also use Flash Cookies (also known as Local Stored Objects) and similar technologies to personalize and enhance your online experience. A Flash cookie is a small data file placed on a computer using Adobe Flash technology. The Adobe Flash Player is an application that allows rapid development of dynamic content, such as video clips and animation.</p>
<p>We use Flash cookies to personalize and enhance your online experience and to deliver content for Flash players. We may also use Flash cookies for security purposes, to gather certain website metrics and to help remember settings and preferences. Flash cookies are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. To manage Flash cookies, please visit Adobe’s website at <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>.  If you disable Flash cookies or other similar technologies, please be aware that you may not have access to certain content and product features.</p>
<h3><em>Pixel Tags and Web Beacons</em></h3>
<p>We also may use “web beacons” on some of our Sites. A web beacon, also known as a pixel tag or clear GIF, may be used to transmit information collected through cookies to our service providers’ servers. They allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.  They also enable our service providers to compile information about your browsing activity on the Sites.</p>
<h3><em>Server Logs and Other Technologies</em></h3>
<p>We collect many different types of information from server logs and other technologies.  For example, we may collect information the device you use to access our website, your operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located.  Our server logs also record the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to Macmillan Learning and the website you visit after you leave our site.</p>

<h2>School Data Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>This privacy notice applies to the personal information pertaining to students that we receive from schools or that we maintain on behalf of schools (collectively, “<strong>School Data</strong>”), such as information about class rosters and data from students who use our learning platforms at the direction of an educational agency or school.</p>
<p>Macmillan Learning is committed to protecting the privacy and security of all School Data that we process in order to provide services to you and your school. Additionally, if your school is based in: i) the United States, your student records may be protected by the Family and Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA); and ii) Canada, your information held by public bodies may be protected by The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA). For information on your school's privacy policies, please contact the administration.</p>
<p>If your school has contracted with us to provide products and platforms for you to use in your courses, we only use your personal information in the School Data as needed to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide you with the products, content or services selected by you, your instructors or your school and for related activities, such as customer service and “helpdesk” functions,</li>
    <li>Assure academic integrity, such as in connection with investigations and anti-plagiarism program,</li>

    <li>Manage our everyday business needs, such as website administration, business continuity and disaster recovery, security and fraud prevention, corporate governance, reporting and legal compliance.</li>

<p>We will only use School Data for other purposes with the consent of your school and (if applicable) with your consent. Please note that we may publish reports or create products that contain de-identified, aggregated or statistical data, such as benchmarking reports that reveal how students generally engage with our platforms. These reports and products do not contain any information that would enable the recipient to contact, locate or identify you or your school.</p>
<p>We do not use School Data for targeted marketing purposes. This means that we do not select or deliver ads to you in our educational products and services based on your School Data obtained or inferred over time from your use of our educational products and services.  We may deliver generic or contextual ads to you while you use our educational products or platforms, but we do not target these ads based on your School Data.</p>
<p>All School Data may be shared with your school (including with your instructors and school administrators).  Your instructors generally have access to all School Data, including the information generated by your use of the products for a class, and we may provide other information to your school as needed to investigate possible academic fraud or cheating. Your school uses the School Data in accordance with its own privacy policies.</p>
<p>We may share School Data with our affiliates, which only use the School Data for the purposes listed above, and with our service providers, who are bound by law or contract to protect the School Data and only use it as needed to provide the services requested.  We will also disclose School Data when required by law, such as in response to a subpoena, including to law enforcement agencies and courts in the United States and other countries where we operate.</p>

<h3>2.	The Purposes and Legal Basis for Processing, including Legitimate Interests</h3>
<p>The Macmillan Learning Privacy Notice explains the reasons why we process your Personal Information. We only process Personal Information when we have a legal basis for the processing, such as where it is necessary:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To fulfill a contract with you or your school, and for closely-related purposes, such as payment processing and financial account management, contract management, website administration, business continuity and disaster recovery, security and fraud prevention, corporate governance, reporting and legal compliance, and</li>
    <li>With your consent (or provided you have not objected, as may be appropriate under applicable law), such as to provide you with marketing communications, in relation to the use of cookies, or where you are asked to provide special categories of data as part of a survey request that we provide on behalf of your school/educational institution.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also process your Personal Information for the purposes of our legitimate interests (or for the legitimate interests of your school, provided that our interests shall not outweigh your rights and freedoms.  In particular, we may process your Personal Information as needed to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Protect you, us or others from threats (such as security threats or fraud) piracy or cheating,</li>
    <li>Comply with the laws that are applicable to us around the world,</li>
    <li>Enable or administer our business, such as for quality control, consolidated reporting, and customer service,</li>
    <li>De-identify it to create anonymized and/or aggregated datasets,</li>
    <li>Manage corporate transactions, such as mergers or acquisitions, and</li>
    <li>Understand and improve our business or customer relationships generally.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may disclose your Personal Information to related companies and to third parties as described in the Privacy Notice; however, we do not share your Personal Information with third parties for them to market their products or services to you without having obtained your prior opt-in consent.  If you give consent for such sharing, you may revoke it at any time. (See the <a href="#">Marketing/Your Choices</a> section of the Privacy Notice.)</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from of children under the age of 16 without parental consent.</p>
<h3>3.	Automated Decision-Making and Profiling</h3>
<p>We may use profiling and analytics to understand how individuals interact with our educational materials, such as assess engagement and improve learning outcomes, and product development purposes.  For example, we may use analytics to study the amount of time that individuals spend on specific content items and we may infer engagement from this this process.  These analytics also help us understand and improve our materials, as can determine what materials are more or less accessible to students.  We may also use analytics for course integrity purposes, such as to identify individuals that may be cheating.</p>
<p>We will not make automated-decisions using Personal Information about you that may significantly affect you, unless (1) the decision is necessary as part of a contract that we have with you, (2) we have your explicit consent, or (3) we are required by law to use the technology.</p>
<h3>4.	When You are Required to Provide Personal Information to Macmillan Learning</h3>
<p>In most cases, you are not required by law to provide any Personal Information to Macmillan Learning.  You are required to provide certain Personal Information to enable us to enter into a contract with you so that you can use our products and services.  Our registration forms indicate which data elements are required for our contracts. If you do not provide these data elements, we cannot do business with you.</p>
<p>If you are a student who is required to use our products for school, you can create a pseudonymous account using an alias by following the instructions in the Privacy Notice.</p>
