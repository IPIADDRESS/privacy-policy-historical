In addition, some promotions may have one or  more co-sponsors, and you may also be asked upon entry to consent to receive  future communications from such co-sponsors. In the event your consent is  indicated, your information from your entry will be shared with such  co-sponsor. In connection with any communications from or disclosure of your information  to any unaffiliated third-party co-sponsors, you acknowledge and agree that  they will be responsible for advising you of their own privacy policies  regarding the use and disclosure of your information, and you should be sure to  read them. In all events, we will make it clear to you in the entry form,  before you submit it, whether you are consenting to receive information from  any party, and you will be given the opportunity to confirm or withdraw such  consent prior to submitting your entry. </p>
			Notwithstanding any restrictions in this Privacy  Policy, if Bed Bath &amp; Beyond asks you for Personal Information and you  elect to have us share your Personal Information with third parties, such as in  the promotions discussed above, such election shall constitute your consent to  Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's disclosure of your Personal Information.
