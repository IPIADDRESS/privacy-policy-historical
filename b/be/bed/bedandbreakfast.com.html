</span><blockquote><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Newsletters</span>: We and the websites of our affiliates may offer different newsletters from time to time intended to enhance the services we or they offer. Users may cancel their subscription to these newsletters at any time.<br>
</span>
</blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Surveys</span>: Surveys are another method by which we gather information about our users. From time to time, we request users' input in order to evaluate potential features and services. The decision to answer a survey is completely yours. We use information gathered from surveys to improve our services.<br>
</span>
</blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reservations &amp; Bookings</span>:&nbsp; Travelers may reserve and book rooms for a future stay in properties owned by our members.&nbsp; Reservations and bookings will require that you submit your personal information and may also require credit card or other payment information.<br>
</span>
</blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">E-Mailing Innkeepers</span>: Travelers may send e-mails to members via the listings on our Site. If you choose to send an inquiry through these links, your personal information, including your e-mail address and any other information you supply, will be visible to the member in question so that they might reply directly to you. If you call the member, you may be asked to leave a return telephone number. Do not share information in the e-mail or phone call that you are not prepared to allow them to have, including, but not limited to, credit card and bank account information. These inquiries are both sent to the individual member you selected and to our system. The resulting e-mail is available for review only by the member to whom they were initially addressed and to our customer service employees, who may be asked by members for their past e-mail information. While the content of these e-mails is not shared with any other party, we may, from time to time, use third party e-mail servers to send and track receipt of the e-mails, and analyze the pattern of inquiry usage reported by these third party tracking systems.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reviews</span></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">
</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">: Travelers may leave reviews about properties of our members they stayed in and members may also respond to reviews.&nbsp; Travelers are urged not to put any personal data or information about themselves in any review and users may not put any personal data or information about anyone else in any review or response to a review.&nbsp; When submitting a review, travelers will be requested to provide a valid email address, information to confirm their stay in the property and other personal data may be requested as well. <br>
</span>
</blockquote><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><strong>Caution About Phishing or False E-mails</strong><br>
If you receive an unsolicited e-mail that appears to be from us or one of our members that requests personal information (such as your credit card, login, or password), or that asks you to verify or confirm your account or other personal information by clicking on a link, that e-mail was likely to have been sent by someone trying to unlawfully obtain your information, sometimes referred to as a "phisher" or "spoofer." We do not ask for this type of information in an e-mail. Do not provide the information or click on the link. Note that if you clicked on a link in such an e-mail, this would not compromise your account or information that you provided to the Site.&nbsp; However, the sender of such an email would be able to obtain your information if you provided it to them in the link or by a return e-mail.<br>
<br>
<strong>How We May Disclose Your Personal Data to Third Parties</strong></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">
</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br>
We may disclose your personal data to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, or respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the right of others.&nbsp; In all cases, such information will be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.<br>
<br>
We may also share your information with:</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">
</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br>
</span>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">one of our partners, but only if&nbsp; you've requested their services or to be notified by them; </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">a third party performing services on our behalf and has agreed to keep such information confidential (such as the processing of your credit card payment or the conduct of an online survey, for example); </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">our subsidiaries and/or affiliates, but only in accordance with this Privacy Policy;</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">legal or government officials in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation, alleged illegal activity or other governmental request, provided that we will require a court order, subpoena or similar legal procedure except when we believe in good faith that disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm, financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity; </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">other companies or business entities, in the event we are merged with or acquired by such company or business entity.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br>
<strong>How Do We Protect Your Personal Information Once We Have It?</strong></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">
</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br>
We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to guard against unauthorized or unlawful processing of your personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal data. While no system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our site reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. We have security measures in place to protect our user database and access to this database is restricted internally. <br>
<br>
However, it remains each user's responsibility:</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">
</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br>
</span>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">to protect against unauthorized access to your use of the Site; </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">to ensure no-one else uses the Site while the user's machine is "logged on" to the Site service; </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">to log off or exit from Site when not using it; and </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">where relevant, to keep his/her password or other access information secret. </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br>
All personal information submitted to us is stored on a secure server. We do not store credit card numbers or related identifying information on any Site server. All such information is stored by our credit card processing partner(s), who are obligated to store such information using secure methods.&nbsp; We also use third parties to help us optimize our Site flow, content and advertising (see below).&nbsp; All of our partners are under contract with us and they are obligated to keep your information confidential.<br>
<br>
Despite the measures taken by us that the third parties we contract with, third parties may nevertheless unlawfully intercept or access private transmissions or data. Therefore, we cannot promise and you should not expect that your personal information and private communications will always be kept confidential.</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">

Some of the pages on our Site use a feature of your browser called a "cookie," which is a small file placed on your hard drive by certain of our web pages.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies, by themselves, are not able to extract personal identification information from you.&nbsp; A cookie identifies your computer, but not you, when you visit the Site.&nbsp; We or third parties under contract with us may use cookies or pixel tags (which serve many of the same purposes as cookies) to help us analyze our web page flow, customize our services, content and advertising, measure promotional effectiveness and promote trust and safety.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies allow us to personalize our site for you and to provide you with information that will help optimize your experience of the Site.&nbsp; Cookies are commonly used at most major websites in much the same way we use them here at our Site.<br>
<br>
