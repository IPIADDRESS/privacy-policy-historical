<p>At BellSouth we are committed to honoring the privacy of our on-line customers and visitors to our Web sites.  We recognize the importance to you of maintaining an appropriate level of privacy and security for the personal information we collect from you over the Internet.  The following discloses our Web site information gathering and use practices and is limited to the protection and use of personal information collected by us in the online environment.  Your access to and use of our site are subject to this policy and any other terms of use or policies posted by us.  Please note that this privacy statement applies only to this site and not to the web sites of our advertisers or of other companies or organizations to which we link.  All references to "BellSouth" throughout this policy statement include, unless otherwise stated, all BellSouth affiliate companies, successors and assigns.  </p>
<p><b>What Kinds of Information Does BellSouth Collect and Use? </b></p>
<p>The only personally identifiable information we collect about visitors is provided voluntarily.  In general, you can visit our Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.  However, some portions of our Web site may be accessible only to users who have registered with us (and who may be asked to provide certain information as part of the registration or login process).  In addition, our Web servers may use "cookies" (<a href="/csbellsouth/scripts/staticpage.dll?spage=memberservices/62.htm&amp;only=y&amp;ck=#cookies">described 
below</a>) to collect information about visitors such as domain names, but not your e-mail addresses.  This information may be aggregated to measure such things as the number of visits, average time spent on the site, number of pages viewed, and methods by which our site was found.  BellSouth uses such information to evaluate the use of our site and to continuously improve the content and services being provided.At times we may ask you for contact information or conduct on-line surveys in order to better understand your needs so that we can provide you with a customized experience.  If we wish to use this information other than as set forth in this statement, we will let you know at the time of collection.  We will take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard this information from unauthorized access.</p>

If we wish to use this information other than as set forth in this statement, we will let you know at the time of collection.  We will take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard this information from unauthorized access.</p>
<p>When you access your account information, order a service or make a payment on-line, request product or service information, send us e-mail, register to receive news or information alerts, establish a “My Yellow Pages,” submit a click wrap agreement or enter a contest that we are sponsoring, we will ask you to provide individually-identifiable information to us.
