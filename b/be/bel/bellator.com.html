<p><b>3.2 	Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</b></p>
<br>
<p>The Site and/or third parties may use "cookies", "web beacons", Flash local shared objects and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, "<u>Tracking Technologies</u>") to collect Other Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web. "<u>Cookies</u>" are typically html or browser-based text or other files (and often referred to as browser cookies) that help store information, user preferences and/or user activity. "<u>Web beacons</u>" (also known as image tags, gif, tracking pixels or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. Flash local shared objects ("<u>LSOs</u>") (sometimes known as Flash cookies and used if Adobe Flash is used) are text or other files that help store user preferences and/or activity.</p>
<br>
<p>These Tracking Technologies collect "click stream" data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Site (such as your visits to the Site's webpages, type of browser use, type of operating system used, date and time of viewing, use of our features and purchasing history or preferences) or other websites, applications or interactive services. Through these Tracking Technologies, we may collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on this Site and other websites, applications or other interactive services and may also collect or access your IP address (which is automatically assigned to any Device(s) and/or Device and Internet browser combination you use to access the Site) and/or set or access some other identifier unique to the Device(s), Device platform and/or Device-Internet browser combination you use to access the Site ("<u>Identifier</u>"). For example, we may set a unique alphanumeric Identifier unique to your home computer on Firefox, or access an Identifier provided by a mobile platform, such as the application or advertising Identifiers offered by Apple. Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process but we may combine any or all of the Other Information we collect using Tracking Technologies and associate it and/or Identifiers with your Personal Information (such as your Single VII Sign-On ID) and/or with other non-personally identifiable unique identifiers assigned by VII or third parties.</p>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 25px">
<p><b>3.2.1 	The Site's Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information</b> By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge and understand that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site and other websites, applications or interactive services through these Tracking Technologies and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you. See <u>Section 5</u> below ("<i>Your Choices</i>") for more information on how you can withdraw your consent for certain purposes.</p>
<br>
<p>We use Tracking Technologies to enable us to collect and then use Information as described in <u>Section 4.2</u> ("<i>Other Information Collected by Us</i>") under "<i>How Is Collected Information Used</i>" below. For example, we use Tracking Technologies to enable Single VII Sign-On, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times or seeing advertisements too frequently, to tailor your experience on the Site by delivering relevant personalized advertising, email marketing and other content and to record if you have opted out of receiving personalized advertising from us.</p>
<br>
<p><b>3.2.2 	Third Parties' Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information.</b> This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, data management platforms, supply side platforms, ad exchanges, traffic or audience measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, "<u>Third Party Service Providers</u>") to, for example, facilitate personalized advertisements ("<u>Customized Advertising</u>") and/or other content, serve advertisements on the Site and/or measure and analyze advertising or content effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site. Customized Advertising enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to you for products and services that you might be interested in based on your visits to the Site and other websites, applications or other interactive services you have visited.</p>
<br>
<p>Third Party Service Providers, as well as Advertisers and other third parties, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device subject to your choices about those Tracking Technologies (see Section 5.2.1 below ("Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers") and "More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies" in <u>Section 5.2.1</u> below) and/or they may otherwise collect or have access to Information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Site.</p>
<br>
<p>We may also enlist the assistance of Third Party Service Providers so that the Site may set Tracking Technologies. For example, to the extent necessary to provide basic advertising serving services such as controlling how often you see advertisements or ensuring you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, we may enlist the assistance of such Third Party Service Providers to create, customize or modify Tracking Technologies set by the Site. See also Section 5.2.1 below for more information on this Site's use of Nielsen's proprietary measurement software to collect and use video viewing metrics and other information.</p>
<br>
<p>Except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site, Third Party Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Site, but we may provide to Third Party Service Providers certain Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies set by the Site in order for the Site to provide Customized Advertising or in order for the Third Party Service Providers to provide other services to the Site, such as measuring or analyzing advertising or content effectiveness or traffic on the Site. For example, in order to analyze traffic on the Site, we may provide to our Third Party Service Providers certain information we collect about your interaction with the Site along with an Identifier so that the Third Party Service Provider may provide analytics services to the Site.</p>

<li>More Information About Cookie Controls. For the following Internet browsers, you may prevent or exercise choices regarding browser cookies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls described in the following:</li>
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
<li><ul style="margin-left: 50px">
<li>Delete <u>existing browser cookies</u> through the "Internet Options", "Settings", Preferences", "Options" or similar menu selection in your browser's menu or otherwise as directed by your browser's support feature, which means that all pre-existing browser cookies are deleted but does not prevent browser cookies from being used in the future.</li>
<br>
<li>Disable <u>browser cookies</u> through the same browser controls which means that browser cookies shall not be used in the future but pre-existing browser cookies may not be deleted. Additional information on enabling or disabling browser cookies and other Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser's support feature. (See the "help" section of your browser for more information.) Disabling may sometimes be referred to as blocking or opting out of browser cookies and relies on browser cookies to remember your choices. If you delete browser cookies using the controls in your Web browser (as described above) after disabling browser cookies, you may have to disable browser cookies again to re-establish your preferences.</li>
<br>
<li>Choose to have the Device you use to access the Site warn you each time a browser cookie or certain other non-Flash LSO Tracking Technology is being set. (You can later choose to turn-off such warnings.) This may be available through your Internet browser on the Device you use to access the Site. Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser's support feature.</li>
<br>
<li>Seek additional information from the provider of your Internet browser through your browser's support features.</li>
</ul></li>
<br>

<br>
<li><b><u>Many tools discussed above are "Internet browser cookie based."</u></b> This means that such tools rely on cookies to remember your choices. For example, if you delete Tracking Technologies using the controls in your Web browser after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking Technologies again to re-establish your preferences and, if you exercise opt-outs through the mechanisms described in our Ad Choices link, and then delete or block browser cookies, you may need to exercise your opt-outs through these mechanisms again.</li>
<br>
<li><b><u>The tools are "Internet browser and Device-specific" or "Device-specific."</u></b> Note that when you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific Internet browser on that Device and not across Devices. This means, for example, that if you block or disable browser cookies for Internet Explorer 9 on one Device, this choice shall not block or disable browser cookies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same Device or on a different Device using Internet Explorer 9. Further, you may need to separately exercise your options for other platforms, such as mobile platform (as described below). See our Ad Choices link at <a href="http://srp.viacom.com/sitefaq.html" target="_blank">http://srp.viacom.com/sitefaq.html</a> for more information about this Site and other options you may have regarding Customized Advertising across Devices.</li>
<br>
<li><b><u>Automatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs.</u></b> Some Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable browser cookies from websites, applications or other interactive services other than those you visit directly (sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and, <b>if so, the opt-out choices you have exercised with regard to third parties may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function.</b> For example, unless you enable third party cookies on Safari, your opt-out choices made on the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising site and on the Network Advertising Initiative site may not function.</li>
