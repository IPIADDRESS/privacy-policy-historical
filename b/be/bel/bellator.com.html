<p>Users that register for Bellator’s wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they willbe charged by the user’s wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from Bellator.&nbsp; Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. &nbsp;<strong>Under no circumstances will the Site, </strong><strong>Bellator</strong><strong>, its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user’s wireless device, telephone number, or email address. </strong></p>
<p><strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration.&nbsp; </strong>To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for Bellator’s wireless marketing services.&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the “single opt-in” or the “double-opt-in” (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of Bellator depending on the type of Promotion.&nbsp; Premium rate services will require the “double opt-in” (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</p>
<p><strong>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Single Opt-in Method:</strong>&nbsp; In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted.&nbsp; The user’s voluntary submission of the designated word or code to Bellator will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to Bellator to send text messages to him or her. Bellator will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a “Thank you” message.&nbsp; The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from Bellator or by sending a text message to Bellator that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:</strong>&nbsp; In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process.&nbsp; The user must affirmatively consent to Bellator’s sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by Bellator) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site’s registration page.&nbsp; The user must also agree to the Site’s Privacy Policy and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.bellator.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=592058&amp;SPID=73496&amp;&amp;DB_LANG=C&amp;ATCLID=205375959&amp;DB_OEM_ID=23600">Terms of Use Agreement</a></span></strong> before the online registration process is completed. &nbsp;Bellator will then send a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Bellator to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate).The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of Bellator’s wireless marketing service.&nbsp; Until the user responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.&nbsp; A user may respond to the “Confirmation” message at any time <span style="text-decoration: underline;">provided that</span> Bellator may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while Bellator continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p>
<p><strong>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:</strong>&nbsp; In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted Bellator will then send a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Bellator to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate).The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of Bellator’s wireless marketing service.&nbsp; Until the user responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.&nbsp; A user may respond to the “Confirmation” message at any time provided that Bellator may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while Bellator continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>b.&nbsp; Termination of Wireless Services by User.</strong>&nbsp; Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from Bellator by the following procedure:</p>
<p>A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by Bellator at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.&nbsp; Bellator will terminate the user’s registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user.&nbsp; Any of these words followed by the word “ALL” in the user’s termination request will cancel all of the user’s registered wireless services with Bellator.&nbsp; If the user unsubscribes from one or all of Bellator service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user’s previous opt-in.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Termination of Wireless Services by </strong><strong>Bellator.</strong>&nbsp; A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that Bellator may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice.&nbsp; Bellator may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.</p>
<p><strong>d.&nbsp; Use of Information.&nbsp; </strong>Bellator will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email address, or other Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use.&nbsp; We will not share any Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure.&nbsp; We will share Personal Information with the operational service providers that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you and with the Parent Companies and Affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information and Other Information.</strong></p>
<p><strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information.</strong></p>
<p>Generally, we do not sell, rent, lease or disclose your Personal Information to third parties, except if you consent to such disclosure or as described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disclosure to Parent Companies and Affiliates.</strong>&nbsp; We may disclose Personal Information to Parent Companies and Affiliates for marketing and/or administrative purposes.&nbsp; You can choose to opt-out of certain such uses as described in the “<strong>Opting-Out of Certain Uses of Personal Information</strong><strong>”</strong> Section above.</p>
<p><strong>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp; Disclosure of Certain Information in Postings Intended to Be Disclosed.&nbsp; </strong>Certain Personal Information associated with a Posting may be intended for disclosure (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Posting Information</span>”), such as username.&nbsp; We will disclose Posting Information in connection with the display of, and other services relating to, such Posting.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>iii.&nbsp; Disclosure In Connection with Co-Branded Services and Features. </strong>&nbsp;The Site may also offer co-branded services and features, such as events and Promotions that we put together with another&nbsp;company or our Parent Companies or Affiliates ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Co-Branded Partner</span>") and that may be hosted on the Site and/or our Co-Branded Partner’s website. We may share&nbsp;your Personal Information with our Co-Branded&nbsp;Partner and your voluntary use of or participation in a co-branded service or feature&nbsp;means that you opt-in and give your&nbsp;affirmative consent to&nbsp;both the Site and our&nbsp;Co-Branded Partner to collect the Information provided in connection with the specific co-branded feature or service and to use such Information for the fulfillment of the feature or service and for marketing or administrative purposes.&nbsp; The Co-Branded Partner will be identified on the co-branded feature or service, along with the Co-Branded partner’s privacy policy.&nbsp; If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner's future use of your Personal Information for marketing purposes,&nbsp;you will need to&nbsp;contact the Co-Branded Partner directly and the use of such information by Co-Branded Partner is subject to Co-Branded Partner’s privacy policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>iv.&nbsp; Disclosure to Operational Service Providers. </strong>We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information and Other Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining the Site’s services, features, functions and operations.&nbsp; We will refer to these third parties as “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">operational service providers</span>”.&nbsp; We use operational service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, activities, services, features and functions we bring you and we disclose your Information to operational service providers for the purpose of providing services to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>v.&nbsp; Disclosure to Certain Other Third Parties.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the above, we will make your Personal Information and Other Information available to certain third parties in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (<em>e.g.,</em> to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process) or if requested by a governmental agency or other authority as part of an investigation;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we believe your actions violate any law, rule, regulation and/or the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.bellator.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=592058&amp;SPID=73496&amp;&amp;DB_LANG=C&amp;ATCLID=205375959&amp;DB_OEM_ID=23600">Terms of Use Agreement</a></span></strong>, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy, Rules or Additional Terms;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with Promotions, as necessary to administer the Promotion or as required by applicable laws, rules or regulations (for example, to provide winners’ lists or make required filings as appropriate);</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you opt-in or otherwise agree to have your Personal Information shared with or otherwise disclosed to a third party for marketing purposes, in which case the third party’s use of your Information is subject to the third party’s own privacy policy;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate: to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries; to protect our business and assets or the rights, property or safety of the Site, Bellator, the Parent Companies, the Affiliates, or any of its or their operational service providers, licensors, suppliers, Advertisers, customers, users, or any other party; to limit our legal liability; to defend our interests; to enforce this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use Agreement and/or to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations or requests by law enforcement agencies or governmental authorities and/or</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, sale, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving us, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Sharing and Disclosure of Other Information.</strong>&nbsp; We may share or otherwise disclose Other Information with third parties, but we do not disclose Personal Information to them except as described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>7</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reviewing, Updating or Deleting Certain Information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, if offered by the Site for registered Users (if any), you may review, update or delete certain Information collected by the Site by clicking “MY ACCOUNT” on the homepage to sign in to your Site account with your User ID and then clicking on "YOUR ACCOUNT INFO" to change, update, or delete your Personal Information.<strong> &nbsp;</strong>However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information.&nbsp; If applicable, we will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but once you select a user name you may not be able to change that user name provided to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain Information collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user’s request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>If the burden or expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such Information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children or Ineligible Teenagers</span></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; If we, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ineligible Teenagers</span>”), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child’s (or Ineligible Teenager’s) parent or legal guardian (the “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parent</span>”) always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message.&nbsp; The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s membership must use their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the “Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use” Section of the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use Agreement</span></strong>&nbsp; to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s member; alternatively, Parents may send an email to the Site’s Privacy Administrator and provide us with your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID and request to terminate your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration.&nbsp; We will not allow direct access to a user’s account and Personal Information by any person without the user’s User ID.&nbsp; If a Parent does not have his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID, the Parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the Parent’s name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s date of birth.&nbsp; The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. Bellator will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration.&nbsp; The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address.&nbsp; Bellator will then terminate the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection of Information.</strong></p>
<p>While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Information.&nbsp; However, regardless of our efforts and the Device you use to access the Site, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission.&nbsp; We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of the Site.&nbsp; We also limit access to the Site by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes.&nbsp; We request that our operational service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phishing</span></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers’ personal identity data and financial account credentials.&nbsp; “Phishers” use ‘spoofed’ e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and social security numbers.&nbsp; <strong>WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD!</strong>&nbsp; If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site’s Privacy Administrator at <strong>privacy-admin@bellator.com </strong>and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your California Privacy Rights.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>If you are a resident of the State of California, we provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options such as your right to opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as “unsubscribe”) or opt-in for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as Advertisers) for marketing purposes.&nbsp; Therefore, pursuant to the California Civil Code, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. <br> <br> If you are a California resident and wish to request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request by email to the Privacy Administrator at <strong>privacy-admin@bellator.com </strong>or by postal mail to Bellator MMA, <strong>www.bellator.com</strong><strong>, 5000 Birch Street, Suite 7100, Newport Beach, CA 92660, </strong><strong>Attn: Your California Privacy Rights, c/o Privacy Administrator.&nbsp; </strong></p>
