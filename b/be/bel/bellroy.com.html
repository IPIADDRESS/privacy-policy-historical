<h2>Worldwide Shipping</h2>
<p>Bellroy customers live all across the globe, so we can ship to anywhere with a letterbox. For P.O. boxes outside Australia and Europe, please use the regular shipping option at checkout (our team of trained delivery owls aren’t allowed in government buildings just yet).</p>
<p>We usually dispatch orders within 2 working days. Delivery times vary based on selected service and destination. Regular post ranges from 3 to 28 working days depending on the shipping address. For more accurate shipping windows check out our Estimated Arrival Time Calculator above.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h2>Express Shipping</h2>
<p>We offer express delivery to most locations with tracking available. Express shipping is generally 1–3 working days for the US, UK and Australia, and anywhere from 2–8 working days for other countries. If you live down a kangaroo trail in Kalkarindji, please allow a bit of extra time.</p>
<p>​In a few locations around the world we don’t offer an express option. This is because the current express services in those regions aren’t reliable enough, or there are currently no options available in that region. </p>
<p>For pricing and more detailed timeframes please use our Estimated Arrival Date Calculator above.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h2>Customs Fees</h2>
<p>Extra duties and taxes may apply to the following regions: Asia, South America, Africa and some European countries that are not members of the EU. During the checkout process a pop up will appear for applicable countries once the shipping destination has been selected. If you’d like to find out more please <a href="mailto:support@bellroy.com" target="_top">email our support team</a>.</p>

<h2>Returns</h2>
<p>We’re pretty stringent with our quality control, but occasionally something might slip through the cracks. If your product is faulty, or we sent you an incorrect order by mistake, send it back to us within 60 days of delivery for a full refund (including shipping*).</p>
<p>If you change your mind (it happens to the best of us), or wish to return an unwanted gift, we will still refund your purchase if returned within 60 days, but the return shipping isn’t covered and refunds will be sent to the original purchaser’s method of payment. All items must be returned in original condition and in the original Bellroy packaging.</p>
<p>Remember, all our products come with a <a href="/customer-care#warranty" target="_self">3 year warranty</a>, so if something goes awry down the track, be sure to let our support team know via  <a href="mailto:support@bellroy.com" target="_top">support@bellroy.com</a>.
</p>
<p>*If you are eligible, we’ll email a prepaid returns slip to you.</p>

<p>If you change your mind, or want to swap a gift for something else, exchange requests can be submitted to <a href="mailto:support@bellroy.com" target="_top">support@bellroy.com</a> within 60 days of purchase.  </p>

<p>Please return your item in original condition, and in the original Bellroy packaging. We recommend using regular post – take a photo of your returning package with the postage receipt visible so we can ship your preferred product without delay. </p>

<p>If you made an error when purchasing online, and it’s still within 48 hours of placing your order, contact our support team right away and we should be able to adjust your order before it leaves our hands.

<h1>3 Year Warranty</h1>
<article>
<p>Our products are covered by a 3 year warranty from the day they were bought, when used under normal conditions and for the purpose intended. Try not to over stuff your Bellroy or put things in there that don’t belong (like ninja stars). If you do put more cards in there than recommended, things can stretch out of shape and put undue stress on the stitching and other materials.</p>
<p>This warranty covers faults in materials and workmanship and doesn't apply if damage is caused by unreasonable use or neglect, normal wear and tear, or if you change your mind. </p>
<p>The Bellroy warranty sits alongside applicable consumer protection law.</p>

<h2>
How do I make a claim?
</h2>
<p>Please <a href="mailto:support@bellroy.com" target="_top">email our support team</a> with your order details and a description of the fault or damage. Including photographs of any fault helps a lot in speeding up claims.</p>

<h2>Where are Bellroy products designed?</h2>
<p>The design process mostly happens in our Bells Beach office in Australia, where we have a gifted team of people from all over the world. The Bells office is equipped with a design lab that lets us prototype new styles using 3D printing, laser cutting and other fun design toys. Occasionally our team works with external designers in places like the USA to collaborate on special projects. This helps keep things fresh, with new ideas and techniques flowing through our HQ on a regular basis.</p>

<h2>Where are Bellroy products made?</h2>
<p>We’re committed to working with the most talented people we can find around the world, no matter where they’re from. Currently, makers in China and India offer the best balance of quality workmanship and value we’ve been able to source, so this is where all of our products come to life.</p>
<p>We recognize there can be concerns when manufacturing in these regions, so all of our major suppliers must comply with a Supplier Code of Conduct. We also work closely with each supplier to ensure staff are treated well and that environmental and social responsibilities are taken seriously. You can find some of our broader thoughts on Responsible Business <a href="/responsible-business" target="_self">here</a>.</p>

<h2>How will my purchase be packaged?</h2>
<p>We have custom-made cardboard envelopes for every product which you can see in the final image on each product page. </p>
</article>
<article>
<h2>How many cards do the products fit?</h2>
<p>For each Bellroy style, we let you know the number of cards it can hold on the product page. This is always a range and is included in the features list located just under ‘Add to Cart’. You can see we recommend 4–11 cards for our Note Sleeve, for example.</p>

<h2>Are all the wallets as slim as each other?</h2>
<p>No. Within our range, some are slimmer than others. Essentially, the more features you want (e.g. access to lots of cards with equal priority), the more storage space you'll need to accommodate that.

<p>No. We do not have the slimmest wallets. If you want to wrap your cards in cling film, you can make a slimmer wallet. Instead, what we offer is a wallet that is as slim as we can get it without compromising on intelligent interactions, considered materials, and comfort in everyday use.</p>

<h2>Where can I find the Micro Pen available with some of your products?</h2>
<p>That cute little pen is called a Walkie Pen. Unfortunately, we don’t currently sell them separately. It’s likely you’ll be able to purchase one online. Search for the name “Walkie Pen” and options to buy should pop right up. You can also purchase the cartridge refills, which are titled “Pilot BRF-8F 0.7”</p>

<h2>Are Bellroy products RFID protected?</h2>
<p>We appreciate that theft using RFID skimming can happen in certain circumstances, so we’ve made our <a href="http://bellroy.com/products/note-sleeve-wallet/leather_rfid/black" target="_self">Note Sleeve</a>, <a href="https://bellroy.com/products/hide-and-seek-wallet/hi_rfid/black" target="_self">Hide &amp; Seek</a> and <a href="http://bellroy.com/products/travel-wallet/leather_rfid/black" target="_self">Travel Wallet</a> RFID secure. The technology has been incorporated into these styles as this is where we believe the technology will be most useful, but please let us know if we should consider the technology for other Bellroy products by emailing us <a href="mailto:support@bellroy.com" target="_top">support@bellroy.com</a></p>

<h2>What is RFID Protection? </h2>
<p>RFID-blocking wallets are designed to help protect you from a specific type of theft, called RFID skimming – which is where information from high frequency (13.56MHz) RFID-based credit cards, passports and transport passes are read and duplicated. RFID skimming is not common, but it can happen in certain cases. For a more detailed article on RFID we recommend <a href="http://www.carryology.com/bags/a-quick-guide-to-rfid-security/" target="_blank">this balanced explanation by our friends at Carryology</a>.</p>

<h1>Materials</h1>
<p>Our number one environmental goal is to make products that are used and loved for as long as possible. So, our materials need to be robust and maintain a lasting appeal.</p>
<article>
<h2>Our Leathers</h2>
<p>Premium leather is durable, supple and has timeless appeal. It ages gracefully and forms a unique character depending on how you use it. This makes it ideal for wallets and other small carry goods. Despite extensive ongoing research, we’re yet to find another material that offers the same balance of qualities (eg most faux or vegan leathers perform poorly when it comes to environmental impact or long term durability). </p>
<p>All of our leathers come from <a href="http://www.carryology.com/liking/industry/introducing-leather-working-group/" target="_blank">Gold Rated LWG tanneries</a>, which helps ensure its production meets strict environmental guidelines. To read more about considerations in this space, including animal welfare concerns, please read our page on <a href="/responsible-business" target="_self">Responsible Business</a>.</p>

<h2>Our Complementary Materials</h2>
<p>In our phone cases we combine leather with moulded thermoplastic polymers to provide extra protection and durability over the life of the products. The inside of most of our cases are lined with microfibre to cushion your phone and help avoid scratching your precious device.</p>
<p>In select All-Conditions product we offer a 500 denier woven polyamide with a double polyurethane backing. It is lightweight, while providing solid abrasion and water resistance for secure protection from the elements.</p>
<p>All zippers we use are premium YKK zips, including the YKK Aquaguard zipper for All-Conditions styles.</p>
<p>Other linings we use are recyclable polyester. Threads are nylon. Both offer long term durability (and therefore improved environmental impact) over other cotton options we’ve tested.</p>
<p>As our product range grows, so does the range of materials we use to produce them. We aim to update this section over time as things develop.</p>

<div class="sidenavColumns__row__column--content__inner" data-slug="privacy-policy">
<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Bellroy is dedicated to keeping your details private. Any information we collect in relation to you is kept strictly secured, and is only used for the purposes described in this privacy policy. We primarily use this information to identify and fill your orders, and to personalise your shopping experience with us.</p>
<p>This privacy policy applies both to information collected through our web sites and information collected offline. By accessing our web sites, you acknowledge and agree to the uses of information described in this privacy policy.</p>
<article>
<h2>
Information we collect 
</h2>
<p>When you visit our websites (including <a href="http://bellroy.com" target="_blank">bellroy.com</a> and <a href="http://carryology.com" target="_blank">carryology.com</a>) or shop with us online, we collect information about you and/or your use of those web sites. This information falls into three categories: Customer Information, Usage Data and IP Address Details. Depending on the category, the information may be considered to be personally identifiable information.</p>
<h3>Customer Information</h3>
<p>Customer information is information you explicitly provide to us when you make an online purchase or you sign up to receive our newsletters, including your:</p>
<ul>
<li>name</li>
<li>email address</li>
<li>shipping and billing addresses</li>
<li>payment details</li>
</ul>
<p>Customer Information can usually be used to identify you.</p>
<h3>Usage Data</h3>
<p>Usage Data is general information about how you interact with our web pages and web sites, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>pages you visited on our web sites</li>
<li>how you came to the website (e.g. via our newsletter or an advertisement)</li>
<li>which particular buttons or links on the site you clicked</li>
<li>whether you have been to the site before</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage Data is collected using cookies (or similar technologies) placed by us and by third parties (see ‘Who the information is shared with’ below). Cookies are small pieces of data that a website sets in your browser, and which may assign an anonymous identifier to you. Usage Data is not ordinarily considered personally identifiable information.</p>
<h3>IP Address</h3>
<p>Whenever you use our websites (or any other web site) the computer from which the web pages are served (the Web server) needs to know your computer’s network address so that it can send the requested web pages to your browser. The public network address associated with your computer is called its "public IP address" and is sent automatically each time you access any Internet site. From a computer's public IP address, it is usually possible to determine the general geographic location of that computer but often not the specific computer and usually not the specific user (if your public IP address is unique to you and is published somewhere public it’s possible that IP address could uniquely identify you). We keep records of the IP addresses from which you access our site to assist us in understanding the online behaviour of our customers or where you have specifically provided us with information about yourself. For example, when you make a purchase, we may record your IP address for security purposes, and that IP address would then be associated in our records with your Customer Information.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h2>
How we use the collection information
</h2>
<h3>Customer Information</h3>
<p>We use your Customer Information for processing and filling orders placed by you, directly marketing our products, delivering our newsletters to your mailbox, and other activities involved in the day-to-day business operations of Bellroy. Bellroy uses the latest 128-bit SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption technology to protect your Customer Information when you purchase from our online store.</p><p>
</p><h3>Usage Data &amp; IP Address</h3>
<p>We use Usage Data to assist us in understanding the online behaviour of our customers, which helps us to focus our marketing activities and improve the service we provide on our web sites.</p>
<p>Using web analytics services on our web sites enables us to measure, collect, analyse and report on Usage Data for the purposes of understanding and optimising customers’ experiences on our web sites.</p>
<p>Geographical location information contained in the Usage Data enables us to tailor your experience on our web sites by displaying different content based on your location, such as local currency and pricing, local advertising offers, and content in your preferred language.</p>
<p>We also use Usage Data for remarketing (sometimes called retargeting) to better target our ads to interested customers. Retargeting uses cookies to identify users who visit a website showing a particular brand of goods or services and then targets advertisements of that brand to that user on other websites. So, after you have visited our web sites, you (or another user of your computer) may see Bellroy ads on certain participating third party websites, including on the Google Display Network and Facebook. Customer Information is never disclosed to third parties for retargeting purposes.</p>
<h3>Who we share the information with</h3>
<p>We share Usage Data with a number of other parties for a range of purposes, including to:</p>
<ul>
<li>handle payments securely (via PayPal Inc. and Braintree Payment Solutions LLC)</li>
<li>distribute direct marketing materials from Bellroy (via Mailchimp and Customer.io)</li>
<li>connect to social networks (via the Pinterest “Pin it” button or via the Facebook “Like” button)</li>
<li>pay commission to our affiliates</li>
<li>target advertising by sending your Usage Data to our advertising partners, such as Google and Facebook</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage Data is either collected directly by or disclosed to third parties during the course of a session on our website, or during advertising or marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>We only share Customer Information with providers directly involved with online transactions (e.g. PayPal), or when you have opted in to receive direct marketing material (e.g. via Customer.io).</p>
<h3>Information Transferred or Stored Overseas</h3>
<p>Many of those other providers are located overseas and Usage Data disclosed to them may be stored on servers located overseas. Similarly, although Bellroy operates out of Australia and generally stores Customer Information and Usage Data on servers located in Australia, some information may be stored on servers located overseas and/or managed by third parties. While we endeavour to ensure that those other providers, and any third party server provider used by Bellroy, manage any personal information contained in the Usage Data, and any Customer Information, in substantially the same way as required by the Australian Privacy Principles, we will not be responsible if they fail to do so, nor will we be obliged to take steps to ensure that those other providers comply with the Australian Privacy Principles. By continuing to use our websites, you consent to your information being provided to, and used by, other providers located overseas.</p>
<p>For further information about how each of the other providers referred to above handles personal information (which may include your Usage Data and Customer Information), we recommend that you visit their respective websites to read their respective privacy policies.</p>
<h3>A note on affiliate links</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.carryology.com" target="_blank">Carryology</a> contains various affiliate marketing links, which mean that we may be paid commission on sales of the products and services that are listed or discussed by us and other authors on that web site. These links do not influence the editorial content posted on that web site in any way.</p>
<p>When you click on an affiliate link, a cookie is placed to help optimise the affiliate program. Some Usage Data is sent to our affiliate partners.</p>

<h2>
Your say and how to ‘opt out’
</h2>
<p><i>Please note that we do not respect the Do Not Track setting available in your web browser.</i></p>
<p>You can contact us to request access to your Customer Information, and any other personal information about you that we may. We will respond to your request within a reasonable period and provide you with access, except in certain limited circumstances. You can ask us to correct any personal information that is not accurate, up-to-date, complete, and relevant or is misleading, and we will change it where reasonable to do so.</p>
<p>For further information about access and correction, or if you have any complaints or concerns about how we manage your Customer Information or Usage Data, please contact us at the details provided below.</p>
<p>If you no longer wish us to use your Customer Information, Usage Data or IP Address Details for certain purposes, you can do any or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>opt out of receiving online communications from us by clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ link at the bottom of the newsletter, advertisement or other communication (as applicable)</li>
<li>delete existing cookies from your web browser and/or disable cookies on your computer and/or other devices (as appropriate). Depending on the particular browser you are using (e.g. Google Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox), this can usually be done on your computer by accessing your ‘Browsing History’ through the ‘Settings’ or ‘Options’ menu (or equivalent) in your web browser, or if you are using a different device, then in the ‘Settings’ for that device. If you do not disable cookies in your web browser, and you subsequently visit our website, fresh cookies are likely to be placed and you may need to repeat the process of deleting existing cookies</li>
<li>alter your ad preference settings in each of Google and Facebook, and on the platforms of other providers, if you have access to do so</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do opt out of receiving communications directly from us, we will no longer use your information for those purposes. If you disable cookies in your web browser, or delete existing cookies, our web sites may not work properly and your experience with our web sites will be less personalised and may make your shopping experience less enjoyable. Deleting existing cookies from your web browser may also cause it to lose recorded information for other web sites, such as previously used usernames and passwords.</p>
<p>Your withdrawal of consent for us to use your information for certain purposes may mean that we can no longer provide our services to you. For example, many of the services of the other providers referred to above, such as PayPal Inc., are integral to our online sales model, and any refusal to disclose Customer Information is likely to prevent us from being able to complete online transactions with you.</p>

<h2>
Changes to this Privacy Policy
</h2>
<p>We may revise this privacy policy from time to time as we add new features or as laws change. When we make changes to our privacy policy, they are reflected on this page. Any revised privacy policy will apply both to Customer Information and Usage Data we already have about you at the time of the change, and any such information created or received after the change takes effect. We strongly recommend that you periodically reread this privacy policy to see if there have been any changes that may affect you.</p>
