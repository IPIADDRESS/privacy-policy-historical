			<p class="articletext">Questions regarding this statement should be directed to

			Bella-Online.com by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@bellaonline.com">info@bellaonline.com</a>

			and writing "Privacy Policy" in the subject line.</p>



			<p class="articletext">Bella-Online is currently seeking review and certification of its

			Privacy Policy by an independent privacy organization. The terms of this Privacy Policy

			are subject to revision in order to obtain certification.</p>



			<p class="articletext">This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of

			our <a href="/terms_of_use.shtml">Terms of Use Agreement</a>. Pursuant to the Terms of Use,

			this Privacy Policy is subject to

			modification at any time. You are responsible to review the Privacy Policy before using the

			<p class="subchannel">How We Collect Information



			</p><p class="category">This Website collects information that falls into one of two categories --

			personally identifiable information and aggregated information.  Personally identifiable

			information is information that can be used to identify you.  Aggregated information is

			information that is not associated with a specific user, such as the number of people who

			visit the Website from various states.</p>



			<p class="category">We collect personally identifiable information whenever you voluntarily

			submit it to the Website.  Examples of this type information include when you answer our

			polls, enter sweepstakes or contests, fill out the registration page, send us feedback or

			post in our chat rooms or message boards.  You always have the option of choosing not to

			reveal this personally identifiable information to us, although certain services may be

			unavailable if you do not.  In the event of a complaint, we may also receive and collect

			personally identifiable information about you from other parties in our Website or from

			other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you in relation

			to that complaint.</p>



			<p class="category">In addition, we collect and store statistics and other information about

			the online activities of our visitors on an aggregated (collective) basis.  For example,

			we track the number of people who view each page, the order in which pages are viewed,

			and other information to learn which features are the most popular and to refine our

			design and marketing efforts.</p>



			<p class="subchannel">Information We Gather or Track </p>



			<p class="category">Information on general usage and any optional personal details you

			provide to us will be used to provide you with enhanced features such as customized

			content, access to our Chat Rooms and message boards, and the ability to participate

			in any of our BellaOnline communities. The following are details of the information

			we collect: </p>





			<ul>

				<li class="category">BellaOnline, Inc. collects data so that we may display personalized content to our

				visitors. Additionally, usage information may be analyzed so that we can judge our system's

				performance or execute your customized features. </li>

				<li class="category">Your computer reaches us via a particular IP, (<b>I</b>nternet <b>P</b>rotocol),

				address. This can tell us things like what part of the world you're connecting from. Or

				what service provider you are using. </li>

				<li class="category">Your browser offers so-called "cookies" which -- if you allow their

				use -- store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of our sites.

				Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best. And when you re-visit our

				site, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. However,

				cookies tell us nothing about you personally unless you specifically give us additional

				information. </li>

				<li class="category">Our registration form asks for contact and demographic information used to

				send news about our products or promotional material from our partners. You will be able to

				opt-out of receiving any mailings. Demographic information may be used to customize the display

				of our site to you by showing content that we think might be of interest or related to your past

				visits.</li>

				<li class="category">Surveys may ask for contact information or unique identifying information

				to increase the value of the results. Contests may require contact information or other

				demographic/personal information in order to determine your eligibility.</li>

				<li class="category">Some of the banner ads displayed in our site are provided by outside companies.

				These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies

				received with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and we do not have access to this

				information. Cookies in and of themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information

				about you.</li>

			</ul>





			<p class="subchannel">How We Use and Disclose Your Information</p>



			<p class="category">Both aggregated and personally identifiable information is used to operate and

			enhance our site and enhance your on-site experience by displaying content and marketing messages

			that we believe will be of interest to you.</p>



			<p class="category">Except as described below or otherwise indicated, we do not sell your personally

			identifiable information to third parties.  On some pages where we ask for your personally identifiable

			information, we may tell you that the data we are collecting on that page will be shared with third

			parties.  Information gathered from such pages may be shared with or sold to third-parties.</p>



			<p class="category">We produce aggregate reports for advertisers. For example, we tell

			advertisers how many people saw or clicked on an ad and additionally, how many people

			saw or clicked on ads in different portions of our service. Where available, we may

			offer additional information about viewer characteristics. <em>However this does <b>not</b> include

			personally identifiable information about you or your online usage patterns.</em> Our

			advertisers allow us to provide our service to you. In return, they need to know

			how to effectively place their ads to potential customers. </p>



			<p class="category">We'll use your email contact information to provide you with newsletters to

			which you subscribe, or for similar information we think you may find of interest. However,

			you can choose to opt out of these mailings. By providing your contact information you will

			be eligible to acquire user ID's and passwords that will allow you to participate in our

			community features, including chat and bulletin boards. </p>



			<p class="category">We also share or sell your personally identifiable information with

			third parties who provide services to our Website or are affiliated with our Website in

			order to enhance the functionality available to you as part of the Website, and to provide

			you with new products and services such as email and Member services. </p>



			<p class="category">Some online activities necessarily lead to disclosure of your personally

			identifiable information to third parties, such as when you include your name and email

			address in a postcard or when you order merchandise in the Store.  For such activities,

			a separate warning may not be provided.  Your choice to disclose personally identifiable

			information in these cases is voluntary.</p>



			<p class="category">In addition, you agree that Bella-Online.com may assign, sell, license, or

			otherwise transfer to a third party, your name, address, e-mail address, member name and any

			other personal information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other

			transfer or disposition of a portion or all of the assets or stock of Bella-Online.com or its

			affiliated entities.</p>





			<p class="subchannel">Who Can Use Collected Information and How</p>



			<ul>

				<li class="category">As mentioned above, we provide our advertisers with aggregate reports on

				advertising activity. </li>

				<li class="category">Feedback is used both by BellaOnline, Inc. staff as well as the individual

				Hosts for each of the BellaOnline Hosted sites. Hosts not only link to content from their sites

				and provide their own original content, but would have available to them any information that

				you send them directly. Hosts use of this information is bound by the principles and practices

				expressed here.</li>

				<li class="category">Please be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information online,

				personal or otherwise, that information can be collected and used by others. For example,

				using chat, bulletin boards, or your e-mail, if you post personal information online you

				may receive unsolicited messages from others. BellaOnline, Inc. will have no means to

				control this. </li>

			</ul>





			<p class="subchannel">Controlling or Changing Your Information</p>



			<p class="category">You can access and update your personal information, including changing your

			subscriptions to our email newsletters, by going to the

			from us or having your information shared with or sold to third parties.  While you can modify or

			by the Terms of Use to maintain your Membership on BellaOnline.com.  If you delete that information,

			you may lose access to the Website.</p>





			<p class="subchannel">Cookies and Other Tracking Methods</p>



			<p class="category">We use cookies (see <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com" target="_blank">cookiecentral.com</a>

			for complete information) or

			IP addresses for a number of uses, including allowing you to store your password without having

			to constantly re-enter it, helping us to tailor a Web site or a marketing message to better

			match your needs and interests, and allowing us to better understand how users use our site.

			<p class="subchannel">Other Sites</p>



			<p class="category">If you provide any information on your own or directly to parties who provide

			service to the Website (such as WhoWhere?), any merchants in our Store or any other sites you

			encounter on the Internet (even if these sites are branded with our branding), Bella-Online

			Website privacy policies to not apply to the use or disclosure of the personal information

			you disclose to them. On our website we use Delphi Forums to provide message boards and chat

			policies please see <a href="http://www.delphi.com" target="_blank">delphi.com</a>.</p>

			<p class="category">We cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personally

			identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties.  We may be forced to disclose

			investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can (and you authorize us to do so)

			disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government

			officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. </p>







			<p class="subchannel">Security</p>

			 your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers where

			 appropriate. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.</p>
