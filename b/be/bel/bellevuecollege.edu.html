<h2><span id="information-collected-and-how-its-used">Information Collected and How It’s Used</span></h2>
<h3><span id="information-we-collect-if-you-only-browse-this-site">Information We Collect if You Only Browse this Site</span></h3>
<p>If you do nothing during your visit to our website other than browse, read pages, or download or print information, Bellevue College gathers and stores certain information about your visit. The information gathered does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store the following information when browsing the site:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Internet Protocol (IP) Address and domain name used. The IP Address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. IP addresses are used to direct Internet information between computing systems. This address can be translated to determine the domain name of your service provider (e.g. xcompany.com or yourschool.edu);</li>
<li>The type of browser, operating system and screen resolution used on your computer;</li>
<li>The date and time you visited this site;</li>
<li>The web pages or services you accessed at this site; and</li>
<li>The website you visited prior to coming to this website (referring sites or links).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we may utilize Google Analytics for Demographics and Interest Reporting, which uses both first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) or other first-party identifiers, and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to assemble interest and demographic profiles. We will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information collected through any Google advertising product or feature without affirmative opt-in consent to that merger.&nbsp;You can opt out of data collection through Google Analytics by using <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">one of the available opt-outs that Google provides</a>.</p>
<p>The information automatically collected or temporarily stored by the college is used anonymously to monitor bandwidth use (performance) of servers and website traffic trends and patterns. The college analyzes this information to determine how visitors are using our web-based content and services so we may continually improve the site’s usefulness to the public.</p>
<h3><span id="information-we-collect-if-you-volunteer-information">Information We Collect if You Volunteer Information</span></h3>
<p>If during your visit to our website you participate in a survey, send an e-mail, or perform some other transaction on-line, the following additional information will be collected:</p>
<ul>
<li>The e-mail address and contents of an e-mail if sent to anyone with a Bellevue College e-mail address;</li>
<li>Any information you volunteer in response to a survey;</li>
<li>Any information you volunteer through an online form for any other purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us.</p>
<p>We use your e-mail address to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to you, to address issues you may identify, to further improve our website, or to forward the e-mail to another agency for appropriate action. Survey information is used for improving the college systems or any outside services that the college offers. Information from other online forms is used to enable college processes and services.</p>
<h2><span id="personal-information-and-choice">Personal Information and Choice</span></h2>
<p>“Personal information” is defined as information about a person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information may include an individual’s name, address, and phone number. A domain name or IP address is not considered personal information.</p>
<p>The college does not collect personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us by sending us e-mail, participating in a survey, or completing an online form. You may choose not to contact us by e-mail, participate in a survey or to provide any personal information using an online form. Your choice to not participate in these activities will not impair your ability to browse Bellevue College’s website and read or download any information provided on the site.</p>
<p>If personal information is requested on the website or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law.<br>
If you believe that your personal information is being used for a purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact the Public Records Officer [link] as shown in the Contact Information Section of this statement.</p>
<p>Bellevue College is a general audience site and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children online or by e-mail will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public access.</p>
<h2><span id="public-access-to-information">Public Access to Information</span></h2>
<p>In the State of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public’s right to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws.</p>
<p>All of the information collected at this site becomes public records that may be subject to inspection and copying by members of the public, unless an exemption in law exists. <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.070">RCW 42.56.070</a> [Links to: <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.070">http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.070</a>] states that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying all public records, unless the record falls within the specific exemptions of the Public Records Act or other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records. To the extent required to prevent an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy interests protected by RCW 42.56.210 and 42.56.320, an agency shall delete identifying details in a manner consistent with RCW 42.56.210 and RCW 42.56.320 when it makes available or publishes any public record; however, in each case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and the Public Records Act or other law governing the agency’s disclosure of records, the Public Records Act or other applicable law will control.<br>
