    <h3>Information We Collect if You Only Browse this Site</h3>
    <p>If you do nothing during your visit to  our website other than browse, read pages, or download or print information, Bellevue  College gathers and stores certain information about your visit. The  information gathered does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store  the following information when browsing the site:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Internet Protocol  (IP) Address and domain name used. The IP Address is a numerical identifier  assigned either to your Internet  service provider or directly to your  computer.&nbsp; IP addresses are used to  direct Internet information between computing systems.&nbsp; &nbsp;This  address can be translated to  determine the domain name of your service provider (e.g. xcompany.com or  yourschool.edu);</li>
      <li>The type of browser, operating system and screen  resolution used on your computer; </li>
      <li>The date and time you visited this site; </li>
      <li>The web pages or services you accessed at this  site; and </li>
      <li>The website you visited prior to coming to  this website (referring sites or links).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The information automatically collected or temporarily  stored by the college is used anonymously to monitor bandwidth use  (performance) of servers and website traffic trends and patterns.&nbsp; The college analyzes this information to determine how visitors are using our web-based  content and services so we may continually improve the site's usefulness to the public.</p>
    <h3>Information We Collect if You Volunteer Information</h3>
    <p>If during your visit to  our website you participate in a survey, send an e-mail, or perform some other  transaction on-line, the following additional information will be collected:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The e-mail address and contents of an e-mail if  sent to anyone with a Bellevue College e-mail address;&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Any information you volunteer in response to a survey;</li>
      <li>Any information you volunteer through an online  form for any other purpose.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;    The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and  graphic information formats you send us.</p>
    <p>We use your e-mail address to respond appropriately.&nbsp; This may be to  respond to you, to address issues you may identify, to further improve our website, or to forward the e-mail to  another agency for appropriate action. Survey information is used for improving  the college systems or any outside services that the college offers.  Information from other online forms is used to enable college processes and  services. </p>
    <h2 id="personalinfo">Personal Information and Choice</h2>
    <p>“Personal information” is defined as information about a  person that is readily identifiable to  that specific individual.&nbsp; Personal  information may include an individual's name, address, and phone number.&nbsp; A domain name or IP address is not considered  personal information.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The college does not collect personal information about you  unless you voluntarily provide it to  us by sending us e-mail, participating in a survey, or completing an online form.&nbsp; You may choose not to  contact us by e-mail, participate in a survey or to  provide any personal information using an online form. Your choice to not participate in these activities will not  impair your ability to browse Bellevue  College’s website and read or download any information provided on the  site.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>If personal information is requested on the website or  volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may  protect it.&nbsp; However, this information is  a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to  public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law.</p>
    <p>If you believe that your personal information is being used  for a purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact the Public Records Officer [link]  as shown in the Contact Information Section of this statement.</p>
    <p>Bellevue College is a general audience site and we do not  knowingly collect any personal information from children.&nbsp; Users are cautioned that the collection of  personal information requested from or volunteered by children online or by e-mail  will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public access.</p>
    <h2 id="publicaccess">Public Access to Information</h2>
    <p>In the State of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the  public has a right to access  appropriate records and information possessed by state government.&nbsp; At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to  access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of  individuals.&nbsp; Exceptions are provided by  both state and federal laws.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>All of the information collected at this site becomes public  records that may be subject to  inspection and copying by members of the public, unless an exemption in law  exists. <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.070">RCW 42.56.070</a> [Links to: http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.070]  states that:</p>
    <p>Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available  for public inspection and copying all public records, unless the record falls  within the specific exemptions of the Public Records Act or other statute which  exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records. To the  extent required to prevent an  unreasonable invasion of personal privacy interests protected by <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.210">RCW 42.56.210</a> and <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.320">42.56.320</a>, an agency shall  delete identifying details in a manner consistent with RCW 42.56.210 and RCW  42.56.320 when it makes available or publishes any public record; however, in  each case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in  writing.</p>
    <p>In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and  the Public Records Act or other law governing the agency’s disclosure of  records, the Public Records Act or other applicable law will control.</p>
    <p>The complete Revised Code of Washington (RCW) is available  at: <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/">http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/</a></p>
    <h2 id="nondisclosure">Nondisclosure of Certain Personal  Information</h2>
    <p>The following laws and regulations may prevent Bellevue  College from disclosing the personal information about you except for directory  information. Only directory information can be released without student's  authorization. Students must sign a release in order to have any other  information disclosed or to withhold all information. Education information may  be released to other institutions that have requested the records and in which  the student seeks or intends to enroll. Information may be released to a third  party without student's consent if an emergency situation exists or if  information is requested officially by means of a subpoena, court order or  legal report. Additionally, Congress requires student information to be  released to military recruiters if officially requested. Directory information  may include student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth,  major fields of study, participation in officially recognized activities and  sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance,  degrees and awards received, the most recent previous educational agency or  institution attended by the student, and other similar information.</p>
