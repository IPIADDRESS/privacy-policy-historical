name, your address (and for contract mobile phones 3 years of address
history), e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number and expiry
date and your bank sort code and account number. We also need to know your
date of birth and your residential, employment and marital status.</p><p>We gather this information to allow us to process any orders you may make
which may include undertaking credit checks (both by us and third parties)
and in connection with you obtaining an airtime agreement and mobile phone
insurance. The relevant information is then used by us, our agents and
sub-contractors, airtime providers and insurance companies to provide you
with the products and services you have ordered and to communicate with you
on any matter relating to the provision of the services and products in
general. To help us and airtime providers to make credit decisions about
you, to prevent fraud and to check your identity we and third parties may
search their respective files and the files of credit reference agencies who
will record any credit searches on your file. Details of how you conduct
your account may be disclosed to such agencies. The information will be used
by other credit grantors for making credit decisions about you and the
people with whom you are financially associated, for fraud prevention, money
laundering prevention and occasionally for tracing debtors.</p><p>We may also use aggregate information and statistics for the purposes of
monitoring website usage in order to help us develop the website and our
services and may provide such aggregate information to third parties. These
statistics will not include information that can be used to identify any
individual.</p><p>From time to time we may provide your information to our customer service
agencies for research and analysis purposes so that we can monitor and
improve the services we provide. We or our agents and sub-contractors may
contact you by post, e-mail or telephone, SMS and other messaging services
or fax to ask you for your feedback and comments on our services and
products.
</p><p>We and our group companies may also wish to provide you with information
about other services or products we think may be of interest to you. You may
be contacted by any of the above methods for this purpose. We may also want
to provide you with related information from third parties we think may be
of interest to you.
</p><p>We may also be required to provide your personal information to the
Financial Services Authority and other regulatory and governmental agencies.</p><h2>Our Use of Cookies and Other Information Gathering Technologies

&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h2><p>We monitor the use of our website for customer traffic and purchasing
patterns by the use of "session cookies".  </p><p>Cookies are text files that identify your current online activity from 
other persons and machines requesting webpages from our servers. Our server
will automatically issue you with a cookie when you enter our site. Many
sites use cookies to track traffic flows through their sites.</p><p>
Our cookies only record those areas of the site that have been visited by
your computer, and for how long. You do have the opportunity to set your
browser to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or not
to receive cookies at any time. The last of these, of course, means that
certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user.</p><h2>How We Protect your Information  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h2><p>The Internet is not a secure medium. However we have put in place various
security procedures as set out in this policy.
</p><p>We realise how important it is to securely store any information that you
provide. Beepy on all of its websites maintains the highest levels of
security. Our sites use high-level SSL encryption technology, the most
advanced security software currently available for online transactions. You
can therefore rest assured that we take the privacy and security of your
payment and personal details very seriously. </p><p>You can tell whether a page is secure as a small locked padlock will appear
in the bottom bar of your internet explorer browser window or in the address
bar of other browsers. Only the Checkout stage will be secure to protect
your data.</p><p>We also keep your information confidential. The internal procedures of Beepy
cover the storage, access and disclosure of your information.</p><p>We must advise that despite the measures that we take to ensure that the
security facilities that we provide are of the highest standards as
possible, it is necessary for us to notify you that there is no guarantee
that any e-mail sent by you to us at this site will be received by Beepy, or
that the message will remain confidential whilst in transit. You therefore
accept that by acknowledging this situation that you do so at your own risk.</p><h2>Sale of Business    &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h2><p>If our business is sold or integrated with another business your details may
be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers and their
advisers and will be passed on to the new owners of the business. 
</p><h2>Updating your Details

&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h2><h4>Existing Customers</h4><p>If any of the information that you have provided us changes, for example if
you change your e-mail address, name, address or other details, you can
correct the information by contacting <a href="mailto:care@beepy.co.uk">care@beepy.co.uk</a>.

set out in this policy. If we change our privacy policy we will post the
changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages of the website,
so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it.</p><p>Owing to the global nature of the Internet infrastructure, the information
you provide may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic
Area that do not have similar protections in place regarding your data and
its use as set out in this policy. However, we have taken the steps outlined
above to try to improve the security of your information. By submitting your
information you consent to these transfers. </p><h2> Complaints
