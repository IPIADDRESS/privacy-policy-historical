			<p class="faq_answer">

<p class="faq_answer">
						We will also use Members' personal information for customer service, to provide Members with information that Members may request, to customize

<p class="faq_answer">
						By registering at the Site, Members agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule
						(16 CFR §310 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the "Rule") and applicable state do-not-call regulations. As such, notwithstanding that a

						right to contact that Member via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule and the applicable state do-not-call regulations.

						In addition, by submitting personal information at the Site, Members agree to receive mobile marketing including, but not limited to, text-message

						As such, notwithstanding that a Member's mobile telephone number may be listed on state and/or federal Do-Not-Call registries, we retain the right to
						contact that Member via text-message based marketing in accordance with applicable state and federal law. Further, Members agree that we reserve the
						right to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute Members' mobile telephone and other mobile data with/to any third-party for any and all

						We may maintain separate e-mail lists for different purposes. If e-mail recipient Members wish to end their e-mail subscription from a particular list,
						they need to follow the instructions at the end of each e-mail message to unsubscribe from the particular list. In every e-mail communication that
						BeenVerified™ sends, there is an unsubscribe hyperlink that allows the recipient to unsubscribe from the specific marketing program by simply
						clicking the hyperlink provided and following the instructions that follow. Further, even where a Member unsubscribes from all of our lists, we cannot
						guarantee that such Member will never receive another mailing from us, because we may obtain that Member's e-mail address in the future through a
						different e-mail marketing program that such Member has opted-in to. We can guarantee, however, that if a Member should ever receive another e-mail
						communication from us, that Member will be able to remove his/her e-mail address via the applicable unsubscribe hyperlink. Members may, at any time,
						notify BeenVerified™ that they do not wish to have BeenVerified™ disclose their personal information to third parties for offers and
						promotions by sending an e-mail to help@beenverified.com.
					</p>

<p class="faq_answer">
						To the extent that BeenVerified™ collects your credit card-specific information, if ever, we will use this information to process and complete
						any transaction that you request. By submitting your credit card information to us, you authorize BeenVerified™ to periodically verify that your
						credit card account continues to be a valid and active one by charging, and thereafter immediately crediting, a small sum to the card. Such
						verification may be conducted through a third-party and, in that case, BeenVerified™ would share your specific credit card information with this
						third-party for verification purposes. Apart from said uses, we will not share your credit card information with any third parties without your prior
						informed consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, BeenVerified™ reserves the right to share with third parties the fact that we have credit card
						information on file for specific users, but we will not share your specific credit card information with third-parties without your prior informed
						consent.

						<b>Security</b>
					</p>
			<p class="faq_answer">
						BeenVerified™ takes every precaution to protect our Members' and Non-Members' information. BeenVerified™ regularly reviews, at least once
						per year, its security practices to identify security threats or opportunities for improvement. When Members submit Sensitive Information via the Site,
						we endeavor to keep this information protected both online and off-line. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be
						100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you
						transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
					</p>

<p class="faq_answer">
						When we ask Members to enter Sensitive Information (such as a credit card number, Social Security Number, credit score, etc.), and when such Sensitive
						Information is stored and/or transmitted, that information is encrypted and protected with SSL encryption software. While we use SSL encryption to
						protect Sensitive Information online, we also do everything in our power to protect Sensitive and non-Sensitive Information off-line. All of the
						information that we collect, not just the Sensitive Information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information
						to perform a specific job (for example a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
						All such employees are contractually bound to adhere to our security protocols, which they must verify that they have read and understand. The
						practices for handling information are disseminated to all of our employees. In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you
						and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your personal information. You will
						be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement to
						determine the scope of network damage and to engage in remedial measures.

						<b>E-mail Choice/Opt-out</b>
					</p>

			<p class="faq_answer">
						We provide Members with the option to opt-out from receiving information sent via electronic mailings on behalf of third party advertisers. Members may
						unsubscribe from receiving e-mail at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every e-mailing. We may maintain separate e-mail
						lists for different purposes. If e-mail recipients wish to end their e-mail subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions
						at the end of each e-mail message to unsubscribe from the particular list.
					</p>
			<p class="faq_answer">
						Information sent on behalf of third party advertisers is prepared several days in advance, so Members may continue to receive e-mail from us for up to
						ten (10) days following the unsubscribe procedures detailed above.
