					II. Members Information Collected/Tracked by BeenVerified™ BeenVerified™ gathers two (2) types of information from Members: information that Members submit to us and information that is not directly submitted to us.

The Registration Form may or may not require submission of the following information: (a) e-mail address; (b) full name; (c) company name; (d) date of birth; (e) a Member-specified password; (f) mailing address; (g) credit card information; and (h) any and all information associated with the Searched Subject (such as name, address, social security number) that is required by BeenVerified™ to complete the applicable BeenVerified™ Check, send you email communications, or to respond to your inquiry. If you sign up as an affiliate we will collect your name, email address, company name and address. We will use this information to respond to you regarding becoming a member of our affiliate program. Information not Directly Submitted by Members to BeenVerified™ We gather Members' server, IP address, browser-type, clicks, impressions and other traffic and/or consumer action related information in connection with the general administration of the Site ("Site Data").

The Site Data is comprised of the demographic, usage and/or other characteristics of Members as a group. BeenVerified™ uses third party software for the purpose of tracking, aggregating and storing said Member data. By using the Site you agree to allow BeenVerified™ to transfer and/or sell such aggregate data, which will never personally identify you to third parties. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

					Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
					</p>

						<p class="faq_answer">
					Our third party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to  personally identifiable information.

Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from user lists, analyzing data, credit card processing, and providing marketing analysis.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we will share the personal information of Members (other than Sensitive Information) with our third party data, marketing, and sales partners for the purpose of sending you marketing emails.

					By registering at the Site, Members agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR §310 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the "Rule") and applicable state do-not-call regulations. As such, notwithstanding that a Member's telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, and/or on applicable state do-not-call lists, we retain the right to contact that Member via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule and the applicable state do-not-call regulations. 
					</p>
						<p class="faq_answer">
					In addition, by submitting personal information at the Site, Members agree to receive mobile marketing including, but not limited to, text-message based marketing, from us and our third party advertisers and marketers (where, and to the extent that, such marketing is permitted by applicable law). As such, notwithstanding that a Member's mobile telephone number may be listed on state and/or federal Do-Not-Call registries, we retain the right to contact that Member via text-message based marketing in accordance with applicable state and federal law. Further, Members agree that we may share Members' mobile telephone and other mobile data (such as the Unique Identifier) with our third party data, marketing and sales partner’s non-marketing uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and applicable law. We do not share geo-location data with such third parties unless you explicitly consent allowing us to do so.  If you no longer wish to have your mobile number or other mobile data shared with such third parties, please contact us <a href="mailto:support@beenverified.com">support@beenverified.com</a> or contact that third party directly. 
					</p>
						<p class="faq_answer">
					We may maintain separate e-mail lists for different purposes. If e-mail recipient Members wish to end their e-mail subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each e-mail message to unsubscribe from the particular list. In every e-mail communication that BeenVerified™  sends, there is an unsubscribe hyperlink that allows the recipient to unsubscribe from the specific marketing program by simply clicking the hyperlink provided and following the instructions that follow. Further, even where a Member unsubscribes from all of our lists, we cannot guarantee that such Member will never receive another mailing from us, because we may obtain that Member's e-mail address in the future through a different e-mail marketing program that such Member has opted-in to.  However, if a Member should ever receive another e-mail communication from us, that Member will be able to remove his/her e-mail address via the applicable unsubscribe hyperlink. Members may, at any time, notify BeenVerified™  that they do not wish to have BeenVerified™  disclose their personal information to third parties for offers and promotions by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@beenverified.com">support@beenverified.com</a>.
					  </p>
						<p class="faq_answer">
					To the extent that BeenVerified™  collects your credit card-specific information, we will use this information to process and complete any transaction that you request. By submitting your credit card information to us, you authorize BeenVerified™  to verify that your credit card account is valid and active one by charging, and thereafter immediately crediting, a small sum to the card upon registration. Such verification may be conducted through a third-party and, in that case, BeenVerified™  would share your specific credit card information with this third-party for verification purposes. Apart from said uses, we will not share your credit card information with any third parties without your prior informed consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, BeenVerified™  reserves the right to share with third parties the fact that we have credit card information on file for specific users, but we will not share your specific credit card information with third-parties.

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email or by means of a notice on our home page. Your continued use of the applicable Member Services, Site and/or continued receipt of BeenVerified™  e-mails after posting of the Privacy Policy change on the Site, or receipt of a Privacy Policy change notification e-mail, as applicable, constitutes an affirmative acknowledgment and acceptance by you of the modified Privacy Policy.

					Security 
					</p>
						<p class="faq_answer">
					BeenVerified™  takes  precautions to protect our Members' and Non-Members' information. BeenVerified™  regularly reviews, generally at least once per year, its security practices to identify security threats or opportunities for improvement. When Members submit Sensitive Information via the Site, we endeavor to keep this information protected both online and off-line. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 
					</p>
						<p class="faq_answer">
					When we ask Members to enter Sensitive Information (such as a credit card number, Social Security Number, credit score, etc.), and when such Sensitive Information is stored and/or transmitted, that information is encrypted and protected with SSL encryption software. While we use SSL encryption to protect Sensitive Information online, we also design our systems to protect Sensitive and non-Sensitive Information off-line. All of the information that we collect, not just the Sensitive Information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All such employees are contractually bound to adhere to our security protocols, which they must verify that they have read and understand. The practices for handling information are disseminated to all of our employees. In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your personal information. You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement to determine the scope of network damage and to engage in remedial measures. 
					If you have any questions about Site security, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@beenverified.com">support@beenverified.com</a>.

					E-mail Choice/Opt-out 
					</p>
						<p class="faq_answer">
					We provide Members with the option to opt-out from receiving information sent via electronic mailings on behalf of third party advertisers. Members may unsubscribe from receiving e-mail at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every e-mailing. We may maintain separate e-mail lists for different purposes. If e-mail recipients wish to end their e-mail subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each e-mail message to unsubscribe from the particular list. 
					</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">
					Information sent on behalf of third party advertisers is prepared several days in advance, so Members may continue to receive e-mail from us for up to ten (10) days following the unsubscribe procedures detailed above.

					Children's Privacy 
					</p>
						<p class="faq_answer">
					BeenVerified™  is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and, therefore, we endeavor to protect the privacy of children using the Internet. The Site, as well as its products and services, are not developed for or directed at children. Visitors under eighteen (18) years of age are not eligible to do business with us and we do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from any person that we actually know is under the age of eighteen (18). BeenVerified™  encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate and monitor the interactive activities of their children. If you believe that your child has provided BeenVerified™  with any personally identifiable information, please e-mail <a href="mailto:support@beenverified.com">support@beenverified.com</a> to have this information removed.
