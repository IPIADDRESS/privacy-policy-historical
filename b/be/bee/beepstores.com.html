                <h2>Privacy  Policy</h2>
<p>
  Effective  Date: 05.09.2013</p>
<p>
  Beep Extra Ltd  has created this Privacy Policy to record and explain our commitment to  privacy, and as an agreement with our customers and with other third parties  about our data-handling. This policy lists the types of potentially private  data Beep Extra Ltd collects, explains how we use and protect that data, and  discloses our key procedures surrounding privacy.<br>
  <br>
  This Privacy Policy applies to Beep Extra Ltd services (collectively, the  "Service") and to its website: <a href="http://www.beepxtra.com/">www.beepxtra.com</a> </p>
<p>
  THIS  PRIVACY POLICY IS A BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND Beep Extra Ltd. It forms  part of a larger agreement between Beep Extra Ltd and its customers, website  visitors, and other users, consisting of the Terms of Service provided at <u><a href="http://www.beepxtra.com/en/terms-and-conditions">hhttp://www.beepxtra.com/en/terms-and-conditions</a></u>, as well  as the other documents referenced in the Terms of Service. Your use of the  Service and of Beep Extra Ltd's website is voluntary; if you do not agree with  the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should not provide us with any personal  information, and you should leave the Beep Extra Ltd website. By using our  website or the Service, you signify that you agree with the terms of this  Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting  a new version here (with a new Effective Date at the top), and the new version  will become effective immediately.</p>
<p>
  The  privacy of Beep Extra Ltd's customers and affiliates is important to us.  Therefore:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <em>Beep Extra Ltd  does not sell or rent personally identifiable information.</em> <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Beep Extra Ltd  does not spam, and its policies forbid use of the Service for spam.</em><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><em>Beep Extra Ltd policy requires that all company employees sign a confidentiality  agreement.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>
  The  confidentiality agreement includes the following affirmation:</p>
<p>
  I recognize  that the Company has received and in the future will receive from third parties  their confidential or proprietary information subject to a duty on the  Company's part to maintain the confidentiality of such information and to use  it only for certain limited purposes. I agree to hold all such confidential or  proprietary information in the strictest confidence and not to disclose it to  any person, firm or corporation or to use it except as necessary in carrying  out my work for the Company consistent with the Company's agreement with such  third party.</p>
<h3>
  <strong>Data Beep Extra Ltd Collects</strong></h3>
<p>
  A. Beep Extra Ltd  collects and uses data from our customers, and from visitors to our websites  (including blogs), as follows:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><em>Visitor Number Tracking</em>: Beep Extra Ltd tracks the       number of visitors to Beep Extra Ltd's website, as well as the pages they       visit within the sites and the hyper-links they use (if any) to leave.       This doesn't involve collection of any personally identifiable       information. We use this information to analyze interest in and usage of       the website and the Service.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><em>Data Provided Through       Inquiry Forms</em>:       Website visitors interested in the Service can fill out a sales inquiry       form at the site. Those forms request company name, individual name,       title, address, telephone number(s), and email address(es). Beep Extra Ltd       uses this information to contact the potential customer. We also use the       information to generate statistics regarding interest in the Service. We       might share these statistics with third parties, but they don't include       any personally identifiable information.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><em>Shopping Cart and Portal       Cookies</em>: Beep Extra Ltd's       computer network uses cookies to recognize visitors who use a shopping       cart at Beep Extra Ltd's website. Our network also uses cookies to recognize       customers who use the customer portal at Beep Extra Ltd's website. The       cookies facilitate easy use of the shopping carts and the portal, as well       as visitor number tracking, as explained in the first bullet above.       Finally, we may in some cases use information generated through cookies to       facilitate communications with visitors and customers (including sales       calls). Our cookies have no other purpose.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><em>Customer Account Information</em>: When customers sign up for       the Service, and during their Service relationship, we collect some or all       of the following: company name, individual name, title, address, telephone       number(s), email address(es), credit card number. We also record and       retain most written communications with customers, including trouble       tickets, support requests, and payment history. Beep Extra Ltd uses this       information for customer support. We also use contact information to send       customers Service-related announcements, including newsletters and notices       of new Service features and related products and services provided by Beep Extra Ltd       partners. Customers can opt out of new product/service notices by sending       an email to <a href="mailto:marketing@beepxtra.com">marketing@beepxtra.com</a>, or by following the       unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of any one of the email notices.       (However, current customers may not opt out of necessary Service or       account maintenance notices.) Finally, we generate statistical information       regarding our customer-base and use it to analyze our business. We might       share this statistical information with third parties, but it doesn't       include any personally identifiable information.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><em>Blog Replies</em>: A customer, user, or       visitor may respond to the various blogs provided through our website. If       the author so chooses, the response may include personally identifiable       information, and that information will be posted online along with the       rest of the blog reply. In general, however, we do not recommend that blog       replies include personally identifiable information.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><em>Contestant Information</em>: Beep Extra Ltd occasionally       runs contests for promotional purposes. We may collect certain information       from contestants, including personally identifiable information. We may       list that information in online or other public notices of contest       winners. We may also use contest entries (videos, blogs, etc.) for public       marketing purposes, and we may include contestant names and other       personally identifiable information with those entries. For more on how we       use information provided by contestants, please see the rules for the       contest in question.</li>
</ul>
<p>B. Beep Extra Ltd  also sometimes: (1) tracks the IP addresses of computers communicating (via  e-mail or any other mechanism) with our customers' systems; and (2) inspects  data packets ("deep packet inspection" or "DPI") solely for  the purpose of trending and archiving specific threat types. Data described in  the preceding sentence may include personally identifiable information. Beep Extra Ltd  uses this data solely to maintain the security of the Service.</p>
<h3>
  <strong>Use of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A. Beep Extra Ltd  doesn't share personally identifiable information under any circumstances,  except as provided in paragraph B below and except: (1) to the extent that blog  replies or contest sign-ups include personally identifiable information (per  the contest's rules, in the latter case); (2) as requested by law enforcement  agencies or required by law; (3) to maintain the security of the Service and of  Beep Extra Ltd's own network and data, including by assisting third party  claimants in investigating security breaches; (4) to collect money owed to Beep Extra Ltd,  including through legal proceedings; and (5) to identify, contact, or take  legal action against customers or third parties violating Beep Extra Ltd's  Acceptable Use Policy, interfering with property rights or with the Service, or  breaking the law. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>B. Beep Extra Ltd  sometimes employs independent contractors to help run the Service, and such  contractors may have access to data, similar to the access we give our  employees. Also, Beep Extra Ltd stores sales account data, including customer  passwords and personally identifiable information, with a third party  application service provider.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
  <strong>Data Protection</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A. Beep Extra Ltd  takes precautions to ensure that access to databases containing customer  information is available only from within Beep Extra Ltd's internal network or  through our sales application service provider. Further, we typically encrypt  financial information during transmission, or use secure protocols. No  protocol, encryption, or other precaution can provide complete security for  electronic data, so we don't provide a guarantee of security.<br>
    <br>
    </li>
  <li>B. Beep Extra Ltd  policy requires that all its employees execute a confidentiality agreement  which includes the affirmation quoted above. Most contractors also sign a  confidentiality agreement, with obligations similar to the employees'.  (Customers and other third parties are not beneficiaries of the employee  confidentiality agreement, or of Beep Extra Ltd's agreements with independent  contractors or with the PEO, and so have no rights to enforce those contracts.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>
  <strong>Changing Account Information</strong></h3>
<p>
  Customers  can change their account information. Most customers can do so via Beep Extra Ltd's  online customer portal. All other customers can access and change account  information via the My Profile Page under the Beep Extra Ltd site.</p>
<h3>
  <strong>Reporting Misuse of Data</strong></h3>
<p>
  Customers  and other third parties should contact Beep Extra Ltd about any suspected misuse  of their personally identifiable information or other data. All such inquiries  or complaints should be directed to us via email to <a href="mailto:abuse@beepxtra.com">abuse@beepxtra.com</a>.</p>            </article>
