Ltd. ("Beeketing" or "us"), you consent to our use and processing of your information as set forth herein.
                    This Privacy Policy covers Beeketing's treatment of personal information that Beeketing gathers when you are on the Site or use the Services and that our customers and business partners share with Beeketing. These privacy practices apply to Beeketing's customers and any internet users that visit the websites, applications or other features offered by Beeketing's customers (collectively, "Customer Sites"). This policy does not apply to third parties that Beeketing does not own or control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any order forms or additional agreements to which users agree governing the provision of optional Beeketing features shall take precedence over the terms of this Privacy Policy to the extent of any differences, so please read such order forms or additional agreements carefully.
                </p>
                <h2>Collection of Information from Customer Site End Users</h2>
                <p>
                    This section describes our policies for internet users that visit Customer Sites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Information Collected by Beeketing
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the course of providing user and usage data analytics Services to our customers, Beeketing collects both non-personally identifiable and personally identifiable information about end users of Customer Sites. Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") collected by Beeketing includes data such as your name, address, phone number, or email address, which you have provided to the Customer Site.
                    Beeketing will not collect your password for any Customer Site or credit card information you have supplied to any Customer Site. We do not purchase or receive information about you from third parties (other than our customers).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beeketing also collects non-personally identifiable information about you from Customer Sites you visit, including the following types of data:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Standard Data – common information found in every communication sent over the internet. Using this information, Beeketing can infer information such as browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer); operating system (e.g,. Macintosh or Windows); browser language (e.g., Java or Unix); and internet service provider (e.g., Verizon Fios or AOL)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clickstream Data – Beeketing can infer how you use our Customer Sites and various pages on the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beeketing may use this PII and non-personally identifiable information to provide our Services to our customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                Aggregated Personal Information: In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Beeketing often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Information and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Beeketing may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Beeketing may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes. We partner with third parties that collect information across various channels, including offline and online, for purposes of delivering more relevant advertising to you. We may share personal information with them if you have submitted such information to us, such as your email address, solely in hashed, or non-human readable form. Our partners may link the personal information we share with them to the cookie stored on your browser or device, and they may collect information such as your IP address, browser or operating system type and version, and demographic or inferred-interest information. Our partners use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. To learn more about interest-based advertising in general and to opt out, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices.

                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers transferred to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our Site are visited and by how many people. Like most internet sites, Beeketing uses cookies to enhance our users' and customers' experience on the internet. These cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your name or e-mail address is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most browsers allow you to prevent the browser from accepting new cookies, to be notified when you receive a new cookie, or to disable cookies. To disable cookies set by Beeketing, simply contact us at hey@beeketing and we will provide you with an opt-out.
                </p>
                <h3>Data Retention</h3>
                <p>
                    Cookies set on behalf of Beeketing expire after three years and the expiration date updates every time you encounter our server. Beeketing retains standard web log data 10 years after you visit a Customer Site, and aggregations and reports for up to 20 years after you visit a Customer Site.
                </p>
                <h3>Consumer Choice and Access</h3>
                <p>
                    The process for individual internet users to review and/or request changes to their PII collected by Beeketing is outlined in the Additional Policies section below.
                </p>
                <h2>Collection of Information from Beeketing Customers</h2>
                <p>
                    This section describes our policies for end users of the Beeketing Site and Services, Beeketing customers, and corporate partners.
                </p>
                <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
                <p>
                    We receive and store any information you enter on the Site or through the Services or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use PII provided by you for such purposes as responding to your requests for Services, customizing the content you see, communicating with you about our products, and marketing our Services to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order for you to use all of our features, you must register with Beeketing. We require your e-mail address and password during the registration process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further information may be required if you choose to purchase paid components of the Services, such as credit card and billing information. Beeketing uses third party partners for credit card processing who may require and store your credit card and billing information.
                </p>
                <h3>Automatic Information</h3>
                <p>
                    We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Beeketing automatically receives and records "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Beeketing cookie information, and pages you request. Beeketing uses this traffic data to analyze trends and administer the Site. Our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and its components. This data is only used in the aggregate. This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often users use different parts of the Site and Services. In addition, we may provide statistical collective user information, not information about you personally, to our partners so that they understand how often people use specific components of our Site and Services.
                </p>
                <h3>E-mail Communications</h3>
                <p>
                    If you purchase Beeketing's online tools to collect and analyze user and usage data for your Customer Site through the Site or Services, Beeketing will communicate with you about the services you purchase by e-mail. You consent to receiving such confirmations by e-mail. If you contact us via e-mail through the Site, we may retain a record of your contact information and any information you provide us in your message to respond to you. We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Beeketing.
                </p>
                <p>
