			<h1>Beeswax Privacy Policy</h1>

			<h2>What is Beeswax</h2>
			<p>Beeswax is an advertising technology platform headquartered in New York City. We are providing this privacy policy to inform you about how our technology platform processes information on behalf of online advertisers, website owners, data providers and other businesses that use our technology and services. </p>
			<p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at privacy@beeswax.com. </p>
			<p>Beeswax runs a technology buying platform for digital media. The Beeswax technology allows our customers to buy ad space on websites, mobile apps, video players, and other devices and allows for the use of proprietary and third party data in the purchase of that ad space. When ad space is bought or sold our technology fulfills the transaction by delivering the ad to Internet users who visit that site, apps, or device. Generally, an Internet user's computer or mobile device comes into contact with Beeswax technology when a user views an ad delivered by our technology or clicks or taps on the ad to visit the advertiser's website or app.</p> 
			<h2>Privacy practices for our technology</h2>
			<p>Advertising supports free content and digital user experiences that we all love. Our goal is to make advertising more effective by helping to display ads that may be of interest to you. We believe that relevant ads are more valuable to users than less relevant ads. More relevancy also helps the services that depend on advertising because advertisers pay more for effective ads which in turn leads to higher quality and richer consumer experiences. </p>
			<h2>What information we collect</h2>
			<p>The Beeswax technology collects Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII") to help target online advertising to you based on your interests. This includes, but is not limited to, your IP host address, your browser type (e.g. Chrome or Firefox), the date and time of the ad request, pages viewed, your operating system (e.g. Macintosh, Windows, Android, OSX), the URL or App you are using, and your Internet Service Provider (e.g. Verizon or Comcast). Please note that in some jurisdictions IP Address may be considered PII. We take steps to obscure the information collected from those jurisdictions so that it is no longer personally identifiable. We may also collect Non-PII from clients or other third parties. </p>
			<p>To provide relevant ads to users on mobile devices we may also collect the following mobile specific information: device type, make and model, operating system, mobile advertising identifiers, operating system device identifier (For example, IDFA for iOS and Android ID for Android) and information about the apps you use. We may also use the GPS location of your device if you have opted-in to provide it to one of Beeswax's publisher partners. </p>
			<h2>The technology we use</h2>
			<p>We use the standard "cookies" feature of major browser applications. Cookies are text files that are stored on your computer and we use them to determine how often you've visited a website or seen an ad by assigning an anonymous identifier to your browser. We do not use cookies to access any other data on your computer.</p>
			<p>We also use pixel tags, which are small, invisible 1x1 images on a web page. Pixel tags allow the web page or a third party who serves the pixel tag to set, read and modify cookies. Our pixel tag allows Beeswax cookies to be set, read, and modified when you visit the websites or apps of our partners. </p>
			<h2>Opting out of cookies</h2>
			<p>Please click <a href="optout.php">here</a> if you'd like to opt-out from having Beeswax collect your Non-PII in connection with our technology. </p>
			<p>When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. This cookie tells us not to collect your Non-PII to tailor our online advertising campaigns. Please note that if you block, delete or restrict cookies in any way, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice. </p>
			<h2>Information Sharing</h2>
			<p>Beeswax may share aggregated, non-personal information with customers in connection with reporting and accounting needs.</p> 
			<h2>Changes To Our Policy</h2>
			<p>We may revise this policy at any time. Any changes and/or updates to the policy will be updated directly on this page. We encourage you to visit this page periodically to review our privacy policy so that you will always know what information we gather and how we may use that information.</p>
