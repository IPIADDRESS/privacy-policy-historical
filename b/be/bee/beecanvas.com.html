The data subject may withdraw his / her consent at any time.</p><p>2. BeeCanvas understands "consent" only in cases where the data subject has been fully informed of the planned processing and has expressed his / her consent and without exerting pressure on it. Consent obtained under pressure or on the basis of misleading information will not be a valid basis for the processing of personal data.</p><p>3. Consent cannot be inferred from the absence of a reply to a message to the data subject. There must be active communication between the controller and the subject for consent. The administrator must be able to demonstrate that consent has been received for the processing operations.</p><p>4.

All personal data must be accessible only to those who need it and access can only be granted in accordance with established access control rules. All personal data must be treated with the utmost certainty and must be kept:</p><ul><li>in a self-contained room with controlled access; and / or in a locked cabinet or in the filing cabinet; and / or </li></ul><ul><li>if computerized, password protected in accordance with internal requirements set out in organizational and technical measures to control access to information (eg access control rules); and / or </li></ul><ul><li>stored on portable computer media that are protected in accordance with organizational and technical measures to control access to information. </li></ul><p>3. Establish an organization to ensure that computer screens and terminals cannot be viewed by anyone other than the authorized employees of BeeCanvas. All employees are required to be trained and accept the relevant contractual clauses / declaration of compliance with the organizational and technical measures of access as well as the rules for the locking of workstations before being given access to information of any kind.</p><p>4. Paper-based records should not be left where they can be accessed by unauthorized persons and cannot be removed from the designated office premises without explicit permission. As soon as paper documents are no longer required for ongoing customer support work, they must be destroyed in accordance with the established procedure / rules and the relevant protocol.</p><p>6. The processing of personal data "outside the office" represents a potentially greater risk of loss, theft or violation of personal data. The staff must be specifically authorized to process data outside the controller's premises.</p><p></p><p><strong>Osiris Systems will collect your Information to make better software.</strong></p><p>In order to provide the basic features and other specialized functionalities of the Services pursuant to the Terms of Service by which you are bound by accessing or using the Services, it may be necessary for Osiris Systems to collect certain information from you as outlined below (collectively the “Information”).</p><p>Personal Information: In order to provide our Service to you, we require and collect certain Personal Information from you, such as your name, telephone number, email address, password, and company name.
