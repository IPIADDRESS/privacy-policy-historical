        <h3>General Matters</h3><p>Unfiltered Media Group, LLC takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.</p><ul><li>This Policy applies to all Unfiltered Media Group Web Sites and eNewsletters (“Web Sites”). This Policy does not apply to other companies’ or organizations’ Web Sites to which we link. You should carefully review the privacy policies of those Web Sites in order to determine how they treat your personal information.</li><li>This policy describes what types of information we gather about you, how we use it, under what circumstances we disclose it to third-parties, and your rights to update or correct it.</li><li>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or Web Sites that Unfiltered Media Group, LLC does not own or control or to people that who Unfiltered Media Group, LLC does not employ or manage.</li></ul><h2>INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</h2><h3>Information Gathered From All Visitors</h3><p><strong>Aggregate Data</strong><br>We gather certain generic information with respect to customers’ use of our Web Sites. Information may include number of unique visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the areas on the Web Sites that they prefer. These statistics are very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use this type of data in the aggregate, on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us determine the extent to which our customers use certain parts of our Web Sites, which, in turn, enables us to make it as appealing as possible. We may also share aggregate data of customers’ collective use of our Web Sites with advertisers, sponsors, and other companies with which we do business (“Affiliates” or “Business Partners”). We do this so they, too, can improve functionality and offer services and materials that users want.</p><p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>We use “cookies” on our Web Sites. Cookies are pieces of information or data sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies tell our computer that you’ve visited before and can help to make your visit more personal so you don’t have to re-enter information on a return visit. Cookies also allow us to count the number of unique and return visitors who use our Web Sites.</p><p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you’ve received a cookie or, alternatively, to refuse to accept cookies. It is important to note that you may not be able to use certain features like checking out (and participate in certain offerings) on our Web Sites if you choose not to accept cookies. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our Web Sites.</p><p><strong>Third Party Advertiser Cookies</strong><br>We use third-party advertising companies who use cookies to serve our ads on the Internet. To do so, these companies may use anonymous information about your visits to our Web Sites and other Web Sites. This information can include: date/time of banner ad shown, the banner ad that was shown, their cookie, the IP address. This information can also be used for online preference marketing purposes. Unfiltered Media Group, LLC does not use or have access to this information. If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from setting and/or reading cookies on your computer, currently you may either visit each ad network’s Web Sites individually and opt out or visit the Web Sites of the National Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) to opt-out of all network advertising cookies at http://www.networkadvertising.org/</p><p><strong>IP Addresses</strong><br>We collect and analyse traffic on our Web Sites by keeping track of the IP addresses of our visitors. An IP address is a unique number assigned to your computer when you are using your browser on the Internet. We log this information so that we can monitor things like the number of visitors visiting the Web Sites; however, we do not link your IP address to any personally identifying information.</p><p><strong>Personalizing Your Experience on the Web Sites</strong><br>We try to personalize your experience on our Web Sites by tracking content you have sent and purchases in order to shape our recommendations that might be of interest to you. We also examine customer traffic patterns and Web Sites usage to help us enhance the design and layout of the Web Sites and make it easier to navigate.</p><p>From time to time, we may send you surveys or solicit your feedback. We use surveys to gauge user interest in new products and premiums we may offer. We will ask for your feedback on greetings and other site features. We will use the information we gather to improve our Web Sites and provide a more meaningful experience for our users. We may also use the information to alert you to offers and products in which you may be interested in.</p><p><strong>Subscribing to our Newsletter</strong><br>We send email notifications and information to users who have opted in. Those notifications may be, but not limited to, our exclusive Newsletter, information on new features, new content, other products and services. These communications are sent to you directly by Unfiltered Media Group, LLC. In order to receive the emailed information you must have subscribed via one of our Web Sites or other sources such as our mailing/customer list.</p><p>It is our intention to always allow you to opt out of any of our lists. When you receive any Newsletter or email and you want to unsubscribe, you can simply follow the “unsubscribe” links at the bottom of each edition.</p><p><strong>Offers from Our Business Partners</strong><br>Unfiltered Media Group, LLC may also offer you the opportunity to receive money-saving offers, discounts, and promotions from our Business Partners. These communications may come from Unfiltered Media Group, LLC or directly from the partners themselves. We may also share with them certain demographic, geographic, preference, and other personally identifiable information we have gathered about you. This will help them in directing to you offers that are more likely to be of interest.</p><p>This program is conducted on an opt-in basis. In order to receive the offers, you must affirmatively check to receive information from us. If you leave the box unchecked, you will not receive any offers.
