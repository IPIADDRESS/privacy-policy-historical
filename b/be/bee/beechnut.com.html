              gain access to certain parts of the site or for us to respond to
              your query. We may also use the information provided in statistical

              of male and female users, geographic location, age ranges, or a
              combination of these or other demographics. As detailed below,
              we will not share specific information about you to advertisers
              or third parties without your consent.<br>
              <br>
              We may perform statistical analyses of aggregate (group) user behavior.
              This allows us to measure relative consumer interest in the various areas
              of our web site for product development purposes. Any information we collect
              is used for our own internal purposes to improve the content of the web
              site to enhance users’ experiences when visiting our site, to customize
              the content and/or layout of our pages, and to provide the services required
              by an individual user. We do not use personally identifiable information
              for any reason that is not disclosed either in this Policy or at the time
              the information is requested. Beech Nut processes personal data for specific
              and limited purposes, which we inform you about when we ask you for information.
              For example, we may collect and use personal data to provide you with products
              or services, to market products and services which we think may be of interest
              to you, or to communicate with you for other purposes. Beech Nut keeps
              your data only for as long as is reasonably needed for such purposes and
              in accordance with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or documentation
              retention requirements. Aside from an automatic reply to an e-mail received
              by us, it is our intent not to e-mail to you unless you request a particular
              service, or consent to being contacted by e-mail. There may be instances
              where you will have the opportunity to subscribe to an e-mail list that
              will send information about the site or our advertisers to your e-mail
              address, but after an initial mailing gauging your interest this will be
              continued only with your permission and consent.<br>
              <br>
              We will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required
              to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary
              to 1) confirm to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process serviced
              on Beech Nut or the site, 2) protect and defend the rights or property
              of Beech Nut or its web site, and 3) act under exigent circumstances to
              protect the personal safety of users of Beech Nut’s web site or the
              public.</td>
