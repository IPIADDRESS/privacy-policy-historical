  <strong>PRIVACY STATEMENT </strong><br>

<br>

In order to provide you with the Services, the Company may require that you first provide certain personal information, which we determine is reasonably necessary. Any personal information which we collect from you will only be used for the purposes identified in this Privacy Statement&nbsp; and the Terms of Use, and as may otherwise be indicated at the time the information is collected. Although You are under no obligation to provide such personal data to us, if you choose not to, some of the Company Services may not be available to you.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

The Comany will not disclose your personal information to any third party unless:<br>
1) it is necessary in order to provide you with a particular Service you have requested;<br>
2) it is required of the Company in order to comply with a legal process in any applicable jurisdiction (e.g., court order, subpoena, search warrant, law enforcement request); or<br>
3) The Company determines, in its sole discretion, that disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of the Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates, co-brand partners or other parties, our users, or others. In addition, the Copmany may transmit information to a merchant, such as an invoice number, which may permit the merchant to deduce the identity of a user/reviewer in the event that a merchant disputes a user review on the grounds that a transaction never took place between the user and the merchant and/or an order was never made by the user in each case for the applicable product(s)/service(s).<br>

<br>

The Copmany is not responsible for other parties' privacy policies or their use, storage and processing of data collected on their web sites.<br>

In certain instances, the Company may request that you provide secondary information (e.g., demographic information), which we may use, for example, to learn more about our customers and to develop and improve our services. We may compile your personal information with that collected from other customers to create aggregate data. Aggregate data is information about groups of customers and, once compiled, will not identify you as an individual. We may disclose aggregate data to our business affiliates, advertisers, and other parties.<br>

Our web servers collect from Site visitor's statistical information regarding what pages are visited, the date and time of the visits, how long it took a user to download a page, and the TCP/IP address of the user. These automated server functions do not collect this information in a manner intended to identify your individual use of the Site, nor do we use this information for any such purpose. This information is collected to assist us in maintaining a high quality site, as well as, providing necessary traffic information to our advertisers. We use Web beacons and cookies on the Site. The type of information we collect includes the product codes and prices for merchandise that visitors purchase, and the pages visited. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see.<br>
