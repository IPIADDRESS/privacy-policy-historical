        Friends Privacy Policy</font></strong></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>General Statement</strong><br>
        Best Friends Animal Society has established security policies to protect 
        the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information collected online. 
        The following is an explanation of our policies regarding the collection 
        and use of personal information from our online visitors. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This privacy statement 
        applies to information collected on our website only. There are several 
        places on our site where we link to other websites or to services hosted 
        by other websites. Please be advised that the privacy policies on other 
        sites may not be consistent with our own privacy policy. We encourage 
        you to read the privacy policy of a website before engaging in transactions 
        with that site. The sections of our site that link to other sites include 
        forums/bulletin boards, the Pet Club store, Best Friends Visa credit card 
        application, and the Telecare program. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Information 
        Collection</strong><br>
        In several areas of this site we collect personally identifiable information. 
        “Personally identifiable” refers to information that could 
        be used to contact a person, such as full name, home address, email address, 
        and telephone number. Any personally identifiable information collected 
        online by Best Friends is provided entirely on a voluntary basis by our 
        visitors, in areas involving voluntary transactions such as making a donation 
        online, joining a forum or bulletin board, signing up to become a member 
        of the Best Friends Network, and subscribing to the Best Friends magazine. 
        Personally identifiable information collected online is used by Best Friends 
        solely for internal purposes. For more information on the collection and 
        use of personally identifiable information, please see “Security” 
        and “Cookies” below.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Use of Information</strong><br>
        We do not sell, rent, or exchange personal information collected online 
        on our website with other companies. We may use email addresses collected 
        on our website to circulate news about Best Friends Animal Society and 
        its programs, to promote events, and to acquire new members and subscribers. 
        We may share aggregated demographic information with our funders for the 
        purpose of demonstrating that we are meeting our organizational goals. 
        A visitor who receives email from us may opt out of email at any time 
        by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email, or by sending 
        an email to <a href="mailto:info@bestfriends.org">info@bestfriends.org</a>. 
        </font></p>
      <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Children</strong><br>
      Best Friends operates a general audience website. We have a section for 
      humane education (called “Schoolhouse”) that provides material 
      of interest to students and teachers. If we receive personally identifiable 
      information from children under the age of 13, we may use it to seek consent 
      from a parent or teacher in order to fulfill information requests. (We follow 
      the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/coppa.htm" target="_blank">COPPA 
      guidelines </a>established by the FTC.) Purchases in our online store may 
      be made by valid credit card holders only. Our forums/bulletin boards are 
      intended for adults.</font> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Security</strong><br>
        Best Friends uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect and 
        encrypt online donation and order information while it is being transferred 
        across the Internet. SSL is an industry standard security technology. 
        To further enhance security, stored donation and order information is 
        also encrypted to prevent unauthorized access to the data. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
        Cookies are used on the Best Friends website for the convenience of our 
        site visitors and members. We don't collect personal information via cookies. 
        We do use "per-session" cookies in the Best Friends Pet Club 
        section of the site. Visitors with "per-session" cookies disabled 
        cannot shop at the online store or post to the bulletin boards/forums. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Links</strong><br>
        Best Friends permits other websites to link to our site. However, this 
        does not imply endorsement of products or services on those sites. </font></p>
