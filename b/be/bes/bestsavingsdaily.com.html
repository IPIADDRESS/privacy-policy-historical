<h5>THIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT AN ACTUAL NEWS ARTICLE, BLOG, OR CONSUMER PROTECTION UPDATE.</h5>
<p>*Oxford Dictionaries defines a “rule” as "A principle that operates within a particular sphere of knowledge, describing or prescribing what is possible or allowable." You can learn more about the definition at the <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/rule" target="_blank">Oxford Dictionaries website</a>. The use of the phrase "new rule..." in FreeRateReport.com's advertising refers to providing a new possibility for insurance shopping to help you, our valued visitors, comparison shop to make sure you are still getting the best possible rates on your auto insurance. This rule, or principle, applies to all drivers regardless of the state of residence. Whether you live in a high cost or low cost state, you could save money by shopping around and getting quotes from competing insurance companies. This <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/insurance/2013/11/01/drivers-overpay-368-car-insurance-year/" target="_blank">website</a> reports on survey results showing that comparison shopping can save drivers up to 32% or up to $368 year on their premiums.  <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/finance/insurance/car-insurance-why-do-people-switch.aspx" target="_blank">This Survey</a> shows that the #1 reason people switch insurance is price.</p>
