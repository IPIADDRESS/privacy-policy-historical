          BestNews.com, BestSearching.com and BestSearching.TV Privacy Policy</strong></font><font face="Arial"> <br><br>Best Searching owns and operates a number of different  sites on the Web (each, an "Best Searching Site"). Best Searching is strongly  committed to protecting the privacy of its user community. The intent of this  privacy policy is to detail the information Best Searching may gather about  individuals who visit the Best Searching Sites, how that information is used,  and Best Searching's disclosure practices. Please note that this policy applies  only to the Best Searching Sites, and not to the Web sites of other companies or  organizations to which we provide links or to any software that may be  downloaded from the Best Searching Sites. <br><br></font><font face="Arial"><strong>Anonymous User Information</strong></font><font face="Arial">  <br><br>Best Searching collects some anonymous information each time you visit a  Best Searching Site so we can improve the overall quality of your online  experience. We collect your IP address, referral data, and browser and platform  type. You do not have to register with Best Searching before we can collect this  anonymous information. <br><br>The Best Searching Sites do not require you to  share information that identifies you personally, such as your name or e-mail  address, in order for you to use the Best Searching Sites. The Best Searching  Sites assign an anonymous ID number to your requests and links the following  additional data to that number: the date and time you visited the Best Searching  Site, your search terms, and the links upon which you choose to click. Like most  standard Web site servers, we use log files to collect and store this anonymous  user information. Best Searching analyzes the information to examine trends,  administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad  demographic information for aggregate use. <br><br><strong>Individual User  Information</strong> <br><br>From time-to-time the Best Searching Sites request  information from you that may identify you personally in addition to the  anonymous information described above. The requested information typically  includes contact information (such as name, e-mail address, shipping address,  and zip code), and demographic information (such as age, gender, occupation, and  household income). Best Searching will not use or disclose your individual user  information except as mentioned in this privacy policy. Best Searching collects  individual user information in the following ways from different Best Searching  Sites. <br><br><strong>Surveys or Contests</strong> <br><br>From time to time,  Best Searching may conduct surveys or contests on an Best Searching Site.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you  therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose individual user information  to the Best Searching Site. Contest information will be shared with the contest  or survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information  will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of  the Best Searching Site. We may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or  contests. These companies may use your personal information to help the Best  Searching Site communicate with you about offers from the Best Searching Site  and our marketing partners. Such third parties do not have Best Searching's  permission to use your personally identifiable information for any secondary  purpose. <br><br><strong>Directory Services</strong> <br><br>Best Searching  offers certain personalization services within its directory services (i.e.,  White Pages and Yellow Pages) that enable you to give us your geographic  location so we can remember it for you when you return to use our service. For  example, if we know that you are searching from Boston, Massachusetts for a  particular company, we will pre-populate the city and state fields with Boston  and Massachusetts. While you are not required to use this feature of the  directory services, the information enables us to provide you with a more  efficient experience on the Best Searching Sites. In addition, Best Searching  allows you to update, correct any errors in the listings, or include yourself in  the directory services. In order to make these modifications, you may provide  Best Searching with certain individual user information that Best Searching will  use, along with its affiliates and third party service providers, to modify and  update your information in the directory services database. <br><br>Yellow Pages  listings are supplied by Verizon SuperPages. To add or update your existing free  basic Yellow Pages listing, please go to the following web site: </font><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000cc"><u>https://snap.superpages.com/NASApp/Listing/control/ViewListing</u>.</font>  </font><br><font face="Arial">To delete your listing, please call the customer  service department at 1-800-428-8722, stay on the line without pushing any  prompts, and a representative will assist you. <br><br>You may update or delete  your White Pages listing by searching the White Pages or contacting us to find  your listing. Once you have located it, simply email us to update or remove  link. To verify your request, Best Searching will send an e-mail message to the  address that you provide. Once you confirm the request, your listing will be  updated or deleted. Please allow approximately 24 hours for the update to become  active after we receive your confirmation. <br><br><strong>User Groups</strong>  <br><br>When you register for a user group on any of the Best Searching Sites,  you are asked for your individual user information. The individual user  information may be collected and stored by a third party partner. This partner  will store your individual user information on their servers for a period of  time at which Best Searching will assume such storage responsibilities and your  information will be deleted from their servers. The partner will not have Best  Searching's permission to use your individual user information for secondary  purposes. If you choose to participate in a user group, your individual user  information will be used to qualify you and to contact you for various projects  at Best Searching's discretion. Best Searching may share your individual user  information with a third party with whom Best Searching has entered into an  agreement to support such user group projects. You may opt out at any time by  following the opt out provisions of this privacy policy.  <br><br><strong>Tell-A-Friend</strong> <br><br>If you elect to use our referral  service for informing a friend about any of our sites, we ask you for your  friend's name and e-mail address. Best Searching will automatically send the  friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the Best Searching Site. Best  Searching does not store the information related to your friends and the  one-time e-mail sent pursuant to your input will be our only contact with that  person for such input. <br><br><strong>Correspondence</strong> <br><br>If you  contact Best Searching, we may keep a record of that correspondence and we may  collect your e-mail address. <br><br><strong>Third Party Information  Gathering</strong> <br><br>The Best Searching Sites include content and ads from  third parties that may perform user activity tracking other than that described  herein. For more information about each third party content provider, cookies,  and how to "opt-out", please refer to such third party advertiser's privacy  policy. <br><br>The Best Searching Sites contain links to other sites on the  Web. Please be aware that Best Searching is not responsible for the privacy  practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they  leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site  that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement  applies solely to information collected by this Web site.  <br><br><strong>Cookies</strong> <br><br>Best Searching may set and access Best  Searching or partner cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small data file  that a Web site may send to your browser and which may then be stored on your  system. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For the session  cookie, once you close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent  cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of  time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file  directions. <br><br>We use cookie and web beacon technology to track which pages  on the Best Searching Sites our visitors view and which Web browsers our  visitors use. We may also use cookies to help us provide personalized features  and preferences to you within various Best Searching Sites in a way that may be  linked to individual user information that you elect to share with us. We also  use "action tags" to assist in delivering the cookie. These action tags allow us  to compile statistics and other data about our customers on an aggregate basis,  by embedding a random identifying number on each user's browser. Then we track  where that number shows up on our site. <br><br><strong>Sharing</strong>  <br><br>Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to  disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith  belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial  proceeding, a criminal investigation, a court order, or legal process served on  our Web site. We may also share your personal information if we believe it is  necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal  activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the  physical safety of any person, violations of Best Searching's or such Best  Searching Site's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. <br><br>Best  Searching Sites may use third party service providers to serve ads and e-mails  on our behalf. These companies may use technologies to measure the effectiveness  of ads and e-mails and use information about your visits to the Best Searching  Site so that we can provide a better search experience to you. For this purpose,  we may also provide this third party service provider anonymous information  about your site navigation. <br><br><strong>Mergers; Business  Transitions</strong> <br><br>In the event Best Searching goes through a business  transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a  portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances,  become part of the assets transferred. <br><br><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong>  <br><br>We desire to keep you in control of the personal information you provide  to us. Accordingly, you can review, correct, change or remove the personal  registration information you provide to Best Searching and that Best Searching  controls. In order to elect not to receive future communications from us, please  email us at <u>privacy@bestsearching.com</u>. <br><br>If you have questions  about public record information available through the Public Records service,  please go to the following web site for additional information:  <u>http://www.bestsearching/contactus.com</u>.<br><br><strong>Notification of  Changes</strong> <br><br>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post  those changes to this privacy statement in places we deem appropriate so our  users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under  what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. <br><br>If, however, we are going to  use Individually Identifiable Information in a manner different from that stated  at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our Web  site for 30 days. <br><br><strong>Special Notification with respect to  Children's Privacy (Users under the age of 13)</strong> <br><br>In response to  concerns about protecting children's privacy online, Congress enacted the  Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which sets forth  rules and procedures governing the ways in which Web sites may collect, use and  disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In  accordance with Best Searching policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT:  <br><br>1. Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable information  online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; or  <br><br>2. Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years  of age with third parties. <br><br>It is possible that by fraud or deception we  may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13. If we  are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately  delete the information from our servers <br><br>Questions regarding children's  privacy should be directed to: <br><br>
