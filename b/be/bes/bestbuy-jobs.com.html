<a name="008"> COOKIES, CLICKSTREAM TECHNOLOGY AND THIRD PARTY AD PROVIDERS</a><br><br> 

<i><b>Cookies</b></i> 
<br><br>
A cookie is a small data file that a Web site or an e-mail may save to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive. Our Web sites and e-mails use cookies to create a more personalized shopping experience for visitors to our site. Cookies simulate a continuous connection — they let us "remember" information about your preferences and session, and allow you to move within areas of our Web sites without reintroducing yourself. 
<br><br>
Best Buy uses a third party to place cookies on your computer to collect non-personally identifiable information. Although our cookies may contain a unique user ID, they do not collect or store any personally identifiable information. However, you do have the option of saving your RewardZone membership ID in the cookie so it is easy to remember next time; this option will be found under My Account.  
<br><br>
You may choose to set your Web browser to not accept cookies. However, without enabling your cookies, you will not be able to view, create an account, or make purchases on the Best Buy Web site. 
<br><br>
<i><b>Clickstream Technology</b></i>
<br><br>
Our Web server automatically collects clickstream information such as the address (or URL) of the Web site that you came from before visiting our site, which pages you visit on our site, which browser you used to view our site and any search terms you may have entered on our site, among other things.
<br><br>
Our Web site may also use other technologies to track which pages our visitors view. This anonymous clickstream data provides our customers with a better shopping experience and helps Best Buy understand how visitors use our Web site. 
<br><br>
<i><b>Third Party Ad Providers</b></i>
<br><br>
The Best Buy Web site uses third party service providers to serve ads across the Internet and to analyze Web site traffic on our behalf. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site and your interaction with our ads. These companies may use technologies similar to those outlined above to measure the effectiveness of ads and e-mails. They may also use information about your visits to our Web site so that we can provide advertisements about goods and services.  
<br><br>
No personally identifiable information is collected in this process. We may share anonymous information with this service provider in an aggregate form, for purposes of analysis and improvement of our site.  
<br><br>
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by our third-party advertiser, visit <script>if (!(isCheckout)){document.write('<a href="http://www.atlasdmt.com/privacy/">');}</script><a href="http://www.atlasdmt.com/privacy/">http://www.atlasdmt.com/privacy/<script>if (!(isCheckout)){document.write('</a>');}</script></a>.
