<strong><font size="4"><a name="Collection"></a> Collection of Information</font></strong><br>
<br>
<strong> In General</strong><br>
We may collect personal information that can identify you, such as your name and e-mail address, and other information that does not identify you. BeSocial.com is the sole owner of the information collected on its Website. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this policy.<br>
<br>
<strong> Information You Provide</strong><br>
We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our Website when you create an account, place an order, send us an e-mail or call us, enter a sweepstakes, and/or participate in a contest or survey. This information may include your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information), and information you provide about other people such as the name and address of a gift recipient. We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender and age, and other demographic information as well as public information such as user ratings and reviews, saved restaurant and event listings, and other information you view on the Website.<br>
<br>
<strong> Information Collected Automatically</strong><br>
We automatically collect information from your browser when you visit our Website, which helps us track users' movements around the Site and understand trends. This information includes your IP address, your browser type and language, the date and time of your visit, the content of any undeleted “cookies” that your browser previously accepted from us (see “Cookies” below), and the referring website address.<br>
<br>
<strong> Cookies</strong><br>
When you visit our Website, we may assign your computer one or more “cookies” to facilitate access to our Site and to personalize your online experience. Cookies may also be used to help save you time by remembering the information that you have already provided to us. We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not voluntarily provided by you. The use of cookies is an industry standard and most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies. If you choose to delete or decline cookies, some of the interactive features and services of our Website may not function properly.<br>
<br>
<strong> Web Beacons</strong><br>
We may use standard Internet tools, such as “web beacons” and other similar technologies, to track your use of our Site. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may include web beacons in promotional or other e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer our Site visitors, to monitor how visitors are navigating and/or interacting with our Site, to track transactions processed through our Site, and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our Site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.<br>
<br>
