            <h3>
                Yontoo Layers Information Collection and Transfer</h3>
            To provide services to the User, Best Video Downloader requires Yontoo Layers software
            to be installed. Yontoo is a browser plugin platform that enables application developers
            to build browser applications such as Best Video Downloader.<br>
            <br>
            When you install Yontoo Layers a set of non-personally identifiable values are stored
            on your computer and transferred back and stored on Yontoo’s servers. This set of
            data consists of a randomly generated value that identifies the Yontoo Plug-in associated
            with each of your Yontoo supported browsers, and a randomly generated value representing
            your computer. These non-personally identifiable values enable Yontoo to provide
            you with the services and Layer Apps that you have selected to enable.<br>
            <br>
            Once you have installed Yontoo Layers, each time you load or refresh a page in one
            of the Yontoo supported browsers, a request will be made to a Yontoo owned server
            to determine whether or not you have enabled any Services for the domain you are
            currently browsing. To determine this, the request made by Yontoo Layers will collect
            and pass back the following non-personally identifiable information: The unique
            identifier representing the Yontoo Layers plug-in installed in your browser and
            the URL representing the domain and page you are currently browsing. This data is
            used for the sole purpose of determining whether or not you have enabled any Layer
            Apps for the given domain and page. This Web usage information is never stored on
            Yontoo’s servers.<br>
            <br>
            If you utilize one of the Layer Apps that runs on the Facebook domain, Yontoo may
            also collect your Facebook username and user ID. This information will be stored
            in a cookie on your computer, and passed back as part of the aforementioned request.
            The sole purpose of this additional information is to provide you with a more personalized
            experience while utilizing Facebook related Layer Apps. This information will be
            stored on Yontoo’s servers and is correlated with the above-mentioned Yontoo plug-in
            identifier.<br>
            <br>
            No information from children under age 13. If you are under age 13, please do not
            attempt to register for Yontoo Layers or provide any personal information about
            yourself to Yontoo. If Yontoo learns that they have collected personal information
            from a child under age 13, they will delete that information as quickly as possible.
            If you believe that Yontoo might have any information from a child under age 13,
            please contact Yontoo through its support page (http://www.yontoo.com/Support.aspx).<br>
            <br>
            Parental participation: Yontoo strongly recommends that minors ask their parents
            for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the
            Internet and we encourage parents to teach their children about safe internet use
            practices.
            <br>
            <br>
            This information collection, transfer and storage as described in this section,
            is required for Yontoo Layers functionality. If you do not wish for any of this
            information to be collected or potentially shared as described in the following
            section (Yontoo Layers Information Sharing), you should not use the Yontoo Software
            or Services.<br>
            
            <h3>
                Yontoo Layers Information Sharing</h3>
            
            
            Yontoo may collect and analyze your usage patterns such as which sites you visit,
            that are not personally identifiable. These non-personally identifiable data are
            used to improve Yontoo’s services, and may be shared with third parties.<br>
            <br>
            Yontoo Layers may engage with third party analytics providers, such as Google Analytics,
            to provide Yontoo with data to improve its software and services. Any information,
            such as URL visited, that Yontoo provides to one of these third parties is not personally
            identifiable.<br>
            <br>
            Yontoo reserves the right to track and use aggregate information about users of
            Yontoo Layers, such as operating system, browser type and locality, for a variety
            of purposes. Such aggregate information does not identify individual consumers.
            We may share such aggregate and related demographic information with third parties.<br>
            
            <h3>
                Yontoo Layers Privacy Policy</h3>
            
            
            Yontoo respects the privacy of its users and non-users. Yontoo goes to great lengths
            to ensure that the information collected by Yontoo Layers is secure and only accessible
            by intended users. Yontoo may modify this policy from time to time, and the changes
            will be posted on the Yontoo website (http://www.yontoo.com/PrivacyPolicy.aspx).
