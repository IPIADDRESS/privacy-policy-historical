<p><strong><span>The Information We Collect:</span></strong><span> </span></p>  
<p><span>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the BestServicePlace website.

<p><span>We may use financial information or payment method to process payment for any purchases made on our website, to pre-qualify you for credit card and other offers that you might find of interest, to protect against or identify possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business.</span></p>  
<p><span>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. </span></p>

We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.

<p><strong><span>Third-Party Websites</span></strong></p>  
<p><span>There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</span></p>  
<p><span>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</span></p>  
<p><a name="4" title="4"></a><strong><span>How We Protect Your Personal Information</span></strong></p>  
<p><span>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.</span></p>  
<p><span>We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</span></p>  
<p><strong><span>Blogs, Bulletin Boards, Reviews And Chat Rooms</span></strong></p>  
<p><span>We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others, as well as post reviews of businesses, products, establishments, contractors, and the like, or upload content (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.). Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.</span></p>  
<p><a name="5" title="5"></a><strong><span>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy: </span></strong></p>  
<p><span>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13. </span></p>  
<p><a name="6" title="6"></a><strong><span>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</span></strong><span> </span></p>  
<p><span>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by going to the homepage and clicking on the My Place link. <span> </span>We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. </span></p>  
<p><strong><span>No Rights of Third Parties</span></strong></p>  
<p><span>This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.</span></p>  
<p><strong><span>Changes To This Privacy Policy</span></strong></p>  
<p><span>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an email address), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our website. We recommend that you check our website from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.</span></p>
