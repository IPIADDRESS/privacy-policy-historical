<p>COMMITMENT  TO YOUR PRIVACY<br>  Your  privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. We want to make your  experience online satisfying and safe.<br>
  Because we  gather certain types of information about our users, we 
feel you should fully understand  our policy and the terms and 
conditions surrounding the capture and use of that  information. This 
privacy statement discloses what information we gather and  how we use 
it.</p>
<!-- start: shared_blocks.82769173#below-paragraph-1 -->


<!-- end: shared_blocks.82769173#below-paragraph-1 -->
<p>INFORMATION  WE GATHER AND TRACK<br>  We gather  two types of information about users:</p><ul><li>Information
 that users provide through       optional, voluntary submissions. These
 are voluntary submissions to       receive our electronic newsletters, 
to participate in our message boards       or forums, to email a friend,
 and from participation in polls and surveys<br><br>  </li><li>Information
 we gather through       aggregated tracking information derived mainly 
by tallying page views       throughout our sites. This information 
allows us to better tailor our       content to readers' needs and to 
help our advertisers and sponsors better       understand the 
demographics of our audience. Because this site derives its       
revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing such       
aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to 
      users. Under no circumstances do we divulge any information about 
an       individual user to a third party. </li></ul><p>We Gather  User Information In The Following Processes:<br>  <br>  Optional  Voluntary Information<br>  <br>  We offer  the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of  personal information by users:<br>  <br>  1.  Electronic newsletters policy (Dispatches)<br>  <br>We
 may  offer a free electronic newsletter to users. We may gather the 
email addresses  of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove 
themselves from this  mailing list by following the link provided in 
every newsletter that points  users to the subscription management. </p><p><br>  2. Message  boards/forums policy<br>  <br>
  We may  offer forums in the future. Users of the site's Forums must 
register for these  services in order to post messages, although they 
needn't register to visit the  site. </p><p><br>  3.  "E-mail this to a friend" policy<br>  <br>
  We may  offer our site users the option to choose to electronically 
forward a link,  page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail 
this to a  friend". The user must provide their email address, as well 
as that of the  recipient. This information is used only in the case of 
transmission errors  and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent 
the email. The information  is not used for any other purpose.</p><p><br>  4. Polling<br>  <br>
  We may  offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share 
their opinions with  other users and see what our audience thinks about 
important issues. Opinions  or other responses to polls are aggregated 
and are not identifiable to any  particular user. We may use a system to
 "tag" users after they have  voted, so they can vote only once on a 
particular question. This tag is not  correlated with information about 
individual users.</p><p><br>  5. Surveys<br>  <br>  We may  occasionally
 conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience.  We 
sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys 
with  our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this
 information  about specific individuals with any third party.</p><p><br>  Children<br>  <br>
  Consistent  with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act 
of 1998 (COPPA), we  will never knowingly request personally 
identifiable information from anyone  under the age of 13 without 
requesting parental consent.</p><p><br>  Usage  tracking<br>  <br>  We 
may  track user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, 
we do not  correlate this information with data about individual users. 
We may break down  overall usage statistics according to a user's domain
 name, browser type, and  MIME type by reading this information from the
 browser string (information  contained in every user's browser).<br>  
We  sometimes track and catalog the search terms that users enter in our
 Search  function, but this tracking is never associated with individual
 users. We use  tracking information to determine which areas of our 
sites users like and don't  like based on traffic to those areas. We do 
not track what individual users  read, but rather how well each page 
performs overall. This helps us continue to  build a better service for 
you.</p><p><br>  Cookies<br>  <br>  We may  place a text file called a 
"cookie" in the browser files of your  computer. The cookie itself does 
not contain Personal Information although it  will enable us to relate 
your use of this site to information that you have  specifically and 
knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie  can 
contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off
  your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We use 
cookies to  track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our 
advertising system  delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad 
impressions and click rates.<br>  You can  refuse cookies by turning 
them off in your browser. If you've set your browser  to warn you before
 accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with  each 
cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site.  
However, you may need cookies to participate actively in any message 
boards,  forums, polling or surveys offered.</p>
<h2><em>Privacy  Policy Use</em></h2>
<p>USE OF  INFORMATION<br>  <br>We use any  information voluntarily 
given by our users to enhance their experience in our  network of sites,
 whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on  the sites 
or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our  
users.</p><p><br>  As stated  above, we may use information that users 
voluntarily provide in order to send  out electronic newsletters and to 
enable users to participate in polls,  surveys, message boards, and 
forums. We may send out newsletters to subscribers  on a regular 
schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out  
special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly 
interested in  something we are doing. We never share newsletter mailing
 lists with any third  parties, including advertisers, sponsors or 
partners.</p><p><br>  When we  use tracking information to determine 
which areas of our sites users like and  don't like based on traffic to 
those areas. We do not track what individual  users read, but rather how
 well each page performs overall. This helps us  continue to build a 
better service for you. We may track search terms entered  in Search 
function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we  
don't track which terms a particular user enters.</p><p><br>  We create 
 aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for 
advertisers,  sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to 
advertise more  effectively, and allows our users to receive 
advertisements that are pertinent  to their needs. We don't track the 
usage patterns of individual users.</p><p><br>  Some  advertisements may
 be affiliate links. In this case, a cookie is set identifying  the 
affiliate network and this website’s account with that network. Then if 
the  user clicks or makes a purchase after clicking on a link from this 
website, the  affiliate network is able to credit us with a commission.</p><p><br>
  We will  not disclose any information about any individual user except
 to comply with  applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the
 personal safety of our  users or the public.</p><p><br>  SHARING OF  THE INFORMATION<br>  <br>
  We use the  above-described information to tailor our content to suit 
your needs and help  our advertisers better understand our audience's 
demographics. This is  essential to keeping our service free. We will 
not share information about  individual users with any third party, 
except to comply with applicable law or  valid legal process or to 
protect the personal safety of our users or the  public.</p><p><br>  OPT-OUT  POLICY<br>  <br>  We give  users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:</p><ul><li><strong>Opting not to give feedback or       to register to receive any electronic newsletters we may offer.</strong><br>  </li><li><strong>Opting
 not to participate in       certain interactive areas we may offer, 
which completely alleviates the       need to gather any personally 
identifiable information from our users </strong></li></ul><p>YOUR  CONSENT<br>  <br>By
 using  this site, you consent to the collection and use of this 
information by us. If  we decide to change our privacy policy, we will 
post those changes on this page  so that you are always aware of what 
information we collect, how we use it, and  under what circumstances we 
disclose it.</p>
