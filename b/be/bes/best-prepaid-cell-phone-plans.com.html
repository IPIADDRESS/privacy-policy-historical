</p><p></p><h1>Privacy Policy</h1><p>COMMITMENT  TO YOUR PRIVACY<br>  Your  privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. We want to make your  experience online satisfying and safe.<br>  Because we  gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand  our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that  information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and  how we use it.</p><p><br>  INFORMATION  WE GATHER AND TRACK<br>  We gather  two types of information about users:</p><ul type="disc">  <li>Information that users provide through       optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to       receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards       or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys<br><br <="" li="">  </li><li>Information we gather through       aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views       throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our       content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better       understand the demographics of our audience. Because this site derives its       revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing such       aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to       users. Under no circumstances do we divulge any information about an       individual user to a third party. </li></ul><p>We Gather  User Information In The Following Processes:<br>  <br>  Optional  Voluntary Information<br>  <br>  We offer  the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of  personal information by users:<br>  <br>  1.  Electronic newsletters policy (Dispatches)<br>  <br>We may  offer a free electronic newsletter to users. We may gather the email addresses  of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this  mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points  users to the subscription management. </p><p><br>  2. Message  boards/forums policy<br>  <br>  We may  offer forums in the future. Users of the site's Forums must register for these  services in order to post messages, although they needn't register to visit the  site. </p><p><br>  3.  "E-mail this to a friend" policy<br>  <br>  We may  offer our site users the option to choose to electronically forward a link,  page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a  friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the  recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors  and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information  is not used for any other purpose.</p><p><br>  4. Polling<br>  <br>  We may  offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with  other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions  or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any  particular user. We may use a system to "tag" users after they have  voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not  correlated with information about individual users.</p><p><br>  5. Surveys<br>  <br>  We may  occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience.  We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with  our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information  about specific individuals with any third party.</p><p><br>  Children<br>  <br>  Consistent  with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we  will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone  under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.</p><p><br>  Usage  tracking<br>  <br>  We may  track user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not  correlate this information with data about individual users. We may break down  overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and  MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information  contained in every user's browser).<br>  We  sometimes track and catalog the search terms that users enter in our Search  function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use  tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't  like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users  read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to  build a better service for you.</p><p><br>  Cookies<br>  <br>  We may  place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your  computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it  will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have  specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie  can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off  your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We use cookies to  track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising system  delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.<br>  You can  refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser  to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with  each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site.  However, you may need cookies to participate actively in any message boards,  forums, polling or surveys offered.</p><h2><em>Privacy  Policy Use</em></h2><p>USE OF  INFORMATION<br>  <br>We use any  information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our  network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on  the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our  users.</p><p><br>  As stated  above, we may use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send  out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls,  surveys, message boards, and forums. We may send out newsletters to subscribers  on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out  special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in  something we are doing. We never share newsletter mailing lists with any third  parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.</p><p><br>  When we  use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and  don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual  users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us  continue to build a better service for you. We may track search terms entered  in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we  don't track which terms a particular user enters.</p><p><br>  We create  aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers,  sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more  effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent  to their needs. We don't track the usage patterns of individual users.</p><p><br>  Some  advertisements may be affiliate links. In this case, a cookie is set identifying  the affiliate network and this website’s account with that network. Then if the  user clicks or makes a purchase after clicking on a link from this website, the  affiliate network is able to credit us with a commission.</p><p><br>  We will  not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with  applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our  users or the public.</p><p><br>  SHARING OF  THE INFORMATION<br>  <br>  We use the  above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help  our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. This is  essential to keeping our service free. We will not share information about  individual users with any third party, except to comply with applicable law or  valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the  public.</p><p><br>  OPT-OUT  POLICY<br>  <br>  We give  users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:</p><ul type="disc">  <li><strong>Opting not to give feedback or       to register to receive any electronic newsletters we may offer.</strong><br>  </li>  <li><strong>Opting not to participate in       certain interactive areas we may offer, which completely alleviates the       need to gather any personally identifiable information from our users </strong></li></ul><p>YOUR  CONSENT<br>  <br>By using  this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by us. If  we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page  so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and  under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
