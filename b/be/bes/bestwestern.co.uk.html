<h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

    <li>racial or ethnic origins, should you have specific requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as collecting data directly from you, we will collect Personal Information from a variety of sources including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>through the Site;</li>
    <li>through reservation and call centres;</li>
    <li>through social media and brand channels (e.g. Facebook, Twitter);</li>

The collection and use of Personal Data, whether separately or combined, is done in accordance with and for the purposes described in this Policy.</p>
<p>Our website may also use a website recording service which may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, page scrolling and any text keyed into website forms.

    <li>Responsibility When Information Is Transferred. If a service provider that receives Personal Information from us about an EU data subject or Swiss data subject takes an action that is contrary to the principles of the EU-US Privacy Shield or Swiss-US Privacy Shield, we shall be liable for those actions unless we prove that we are not responsible for causing them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Best Western may also collect “Non-Personal Information,” meaning aggregated and/or anonymized information, demographic information, and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity. Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use and share such information with BW Group Companies, Licensed Hotels, Affiliates, and other third parties for any purpose, including without limitation to facilitate and improve your ongoing access to and use of our Site, to best tailor our services to suit personal interests, to analyze visiting patterns, enhance and improve customer service, and for our other business purposes. As you navigate the Site, we and our service providers may collect certain Non-Personal Information such as your computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version using automatic data collection technologies, such as "cookies" and so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," and other similar technologies.</p>

These third parties collect and share with us, as we may request, Site usage information about visits to our Site, measure and research the effectiveness of our advertisements, track page usage and paths followed during visits through our Site, help us target and track use of our Internet banner advertisements on our Site and on other sites, and track use of other links from our marketing partners' sites to our Site.

We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, validation of a legitimate user session via Google® captcha and administering the Site. Please note that we treat IP addresses, server log files, and related information as Non-Personal Information, except when we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.</p>
<h2>DO NOT TRACK</h2>
<p>Your web browser may let you choose your preference as to whether you want to allow websites to collect information over time about your online activities across different websites or online services. At this time, the Site does not respond to such “Do Not Track” or similar preferences you may have configured in your web browser, and the Site may continue to collect information in the manner described in this Policy. However, as stated in the “Non-Personal Information” section above, we do allow you to exercise some choice in the information collected by adjusting your browser’s cookie settings.</p>
<h2>THIRD-PARTY SITES</h2>
<p>The Site may contain links to third-party websites. These linked sites (which may include the websites of Licensed Hotels, Affiliates, and various BWR partners or other third parties) are not under Best Western's control, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such linked site (or any link contained in any linked site). We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by Best Western or the BW Group Companies. If you decide to access any of the third-party websites linked to this Site, you do so entirely at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of use and privacy policies for such websites. If you provide any Personal Data through any such third-party website, your transaction will occur on such third-party website (not this Site) and your Personal Data will be treated in accordance with the privacy policy of that third party. <strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING LICENSED HOTELS AND AFFILIATES</strong>.</p>
<h2>SECURITY &amp; INTEGRITY</h2>
<p>Because the security of your Personal Data is important to us, we have implemented security measures that provide reasonable precautions against the unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of Personal Data. The Personal Data we collect from you online is stored by us and/or our service providers and protected through a combination of physical and electronic access controls, firewall technology, and other reasonable security measures. Nevertheless, such security measures cannot prevent all loss, access, misuse, or alteration of Personal Data, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such incidents. Where required by law, we will notify you of any such loss, access, misuse, or alteration of Personal Data that may affect you, so that you can take the appropriate actions to protect your rights.</p>
<p>Please do not send us your payment information or Sensitive Personal Data through e-mail or any undesignated area (e.g., submission of your credit card number in a "comment" field). If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (e.g., if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the alleged problem by contacting our Customer Care Department as set forth below in this Policy. Please note that, if you choose to notify us via physical mail, this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the alleged problem.</p>
<h2>YOUR CHOICES</h2>
<p>You may always choose what Personal Data (if any) you wish to provide to us. However, if you choose not to provide certain details, some of your experiences with us may be affected (for example, we cannot take a reservation without a name, and if we cannot disclose your Personal Data to Licensed Hotels or Affiliates, we may be unable to provide you with all or certain reservation services, other services, or membership-program-related benefits. Similarly, if we cannot disclose your Personal Data to other third parties, such as BWR partners (e.g., airlines, card issuers and other third parties), we may not be able to provide all of the available membership program services to you (e.g., earning of frequent customer points with such companies), or the provision of such services may be delayed).</p>
<p>Data privacy under the General Data Protection Regulation 2018 may require us to obtain your consent before we send you information that you have not specifically requested. In certain circumstances, your consent may be implied (e.g., where communications are required in order to fulfil your requests and/or where you have volunteered information for use by us). In other cases, we may be required to seek your consent expressly (e.g., where the information collected is regarded to be Sensitive Information under local regulations).</p>
<p>If you do not wish for us to use your contact information to promote our own or third parties' products or services you can <a href="https://www.bestwestern.co.uk/my-best-western/my-profile">Opt-out here</a>, or you can contact us as set forth in the “Contacting Us” section of this Policy below. If you have received a promotional e-mail from us and no longer wish to receive such e-mails going forward, you may opt-out by using the unsubscribe function in the e-mail you have received from us. Please note that when you unsubscribe from receiving promotional e-mails from us, your contact details will be “suppressed” rather than deleted. This will ensure that your request is recorded and retained unless you provide a later consent that overrides it.</p>
<p>If you have a BWR account, we ask you to indicate your communication preferences at the time you become a member of the BWR program. Once you have indicated your preferences, you can change them by logging into your account.</p>
<p>Please note that if you opt-out as described above, we will not be able to remove your Personal Data from the databases of Licensed Hotels, Affiliates, or other third parties with which we have already shared your Personal Data.</p>
<p>We are entitled to assume you do not object to our doing any of the things mentioned in this statement unless you tell us otherwise in writing or in any other approved manner. However please allow up to one month for us to process all data regarding your privacy choices. Opting out does not apply to service messages such as booking confirmation emails and statements.</p>
<p>If you do not opt-out, in all future marketing communications we will give you the opportunity to decline to receive further mailings. Except where expressly permitted by the General Data Protection Regulation 2018, we will only deal with the personal details you give us as set out above unless you agree otherwise. We have appropriate security measures in place to protect this information.</p>
<h2>SUBJECT ACCESS RIGHTS</h2>
<p>Best Western may allow you to review certain Personal Data through the Site or through other online means. Information about the availability of reviewing your Personal Data is generally available at the Site or on the printed materials where such type of Personal Data was first submitted.</p>
<p>Pursuant to applicable law, you have </p>
<ul>
    <li>The right to request access, deletion or changes to the Personal Information we maintain about you and, where appropriate, request that we update such Personal Information you believe is incomplete, inaccurate or out of date.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>The right to inquire whether we maintain Personal Information that relates to you. Although Best Western will attempt in good faith to respond to your request, we may not be able to provide, delete, or change your Personal Information in all circumstances. For example, Best Western may not be able to change, provide, or delete Personal Information about you if it would impose an undue burden or expense, or require Best Western to also change information relating to another person.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>In addition, in some circumstances pursuant to applicable law, you may have the right to request that we cease using Personal Information about you on the grounds that such Personal Information was acquired by unjust means or used in violation of law. </li>
</ul>
<p>Best Western will honour such requests as required and within the time specified by applicable law and will endeavour to provide these services for free.&nbsp; However, where permitted by law, may charge an appropriate fee to cover the costs of responding to your request, if that request is seen to be unreasonable.</p>
<p>You are generally entitled to ask us what details of yours are being held or processed, for what purpose and to whom they may be or have been disclosed. We promise to respond to your request within 30 days of receipt. In certain limited circumstances we are entitled to refuse your request. If you believe that any of your personal details which we are processing are inaccurate or incorrect please contact us immediately.</p>
<p>When making a subject access request, please be sure to include your full name, address and telephone number, your membership number if applicable and details of your recent stay at a Best Western Hotel so we can ascertain your identity and whether we have any Personal Data regarding you, or in case we need to contact you to obtain any additional information, we may require to make that determination. You can submit your request using our Subject Access Request form <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/company/personal-information-request-form">here</a></span> if you so wish. We are not responsible for updating, removing or suppressing information from the databases of Licensed Hotels, Affiliates, and other third parties with whom we have already shared your Personal Data, or for limiting their use of your Personal Data.</p>
<p>Should you require any additional support regarding these rights, you can contact our Data Protection Officer using the details in the ‘Contacting Us’ section of this Policy.</p>
<h2>RETENTION PERIOD</h2>
<p>Best Western only collects Personal Data that it believes is necessary to perform the services that you seek from Best Western and to exercise its rights and comply with its obligations as otherwise outlined in this Policy. We will keep your Personal Data only as long as we need it for the purposes for which we collect it or as otherwise permitted by law.</p>
<p>The nature of the data means it is difficult to define an absolute retention time for the data held, as it is not possible to define when a customer has become inactive.&nbsp; As long as you have an account with us, we will consider you to be an active customer.&nbsp; BWI will monitor customer data and delete that known to be no longer required, but should you wish to determine whether we hold your personal data, and wish to have any personal data erased, you may invoke your rights as described in the section above.</p>
<h2>NOTE REGARDING THE USE OF THE SITE BY MINORS</h2>
<p>The Site is not directed to minors (as defined by applicable law), and we request that such individuals do not provide Personal Data through the Site. If we learn we have collected or received Personal Information from a minor under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a minor under the age of 13, please contact us as set forth in the “Contacting Us” section of this Policy.</p>
<h2>JURISDICTIONAL / DATA TRANSFER ISSUES</h2>
<p>The Site is operated from the United Kingdom in accordance with laws of England &amp; Wales, and visitors to our Site should be aware that the laws of England &amp; Wales may differ from those of your country of residence. BWGB does not represent or warrant that the Site or any part thereof is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Site do so on their own initiative and at their own risk and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules, and regulations. We may limit the Site's availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time and in our sole discretion.</p>
<p>As an Affiliate of BWI, data submitted to and processed by BWGB is subject to transfer and storage within the United States of America. BWI complies with the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield and the U.S.-Swiss Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. BWI has submitted its self-certification that it adheres to the Privacy Shield principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view BWI's certification once it is approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce, please visit http://www.privacyshield.gov. Please note that a violation of BWI’s commitment to Privacy Shield may be investigated by the Federal Trade Commission and/or the United States Department of Commerce. </p>
<p>If you feel that BWI has mishandled your Personal Information in violation of the Privacy Shield Privacy Principles, please contact BWGB using the details in the ‘Contact Us’ section of this Policy with a description of your complaint. After receiving such description, a representative from BWI's Customer Care Department will contact you to set up a time and manner to discuss your complaint. BWI is dedicated to addressing all legitimate complaints about its adherence to this Policy and the Privacy Shield Privacy Principles and will make a good faith effort to engage in communications to address such complaints. For unresolved complaints under the Privacy Shield Privacy Principles, BWI has agreed to participate in the JAMS EU Privacy Shield Program, an independent dispute resolution program. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by BWI, please visit the JAMS Program Website at https://jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim for more information and/or to file a complaint. If your complaint is not resolved by BWI, or through the JAMS process, under limited circumstances a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.</p>
<p>By submitting any Personal Data to us, you consent to the transfer of such Personal Data to and the processing of such Personal Data in countries other than your country of residence, including countries outside the UK/EEA that may provide a different level of data security than in your country of residence. In addition, if we need to transfer any Personal Data to Licensed Hotels, Affiliates, or other third parties pursuant to this Policy, please be advised that such entities may or may not be located in countries that are considered "adequate" pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation 2018 or other laws.</p>
<h2>CALIFORNIA USERS: YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
<p>California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose Personal Information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information sharing. We have such a policy in place. You may opt-out of information sharing or find out about any rights you may have under California Civil Code section 1798.83 by emailing BWI at <a href="mailto:CustomerCare@bestwestern.com">CustomerCare@bestwestern.com</a> or by contacting us as set forth below under “Contacting Us.” Please note that in order to fulfil certain rewards, we must share your information with our BWI Subsidiaries, Affiliates or third-party service providers. In addition, when you make a reservation or stay at a Licensed Hotel or through an Affiliate, you are providing your information directly to that Licensed Hotel or Affiliate and the restrictions contained in this Section will not apply to BWI with respect to such information. Please follow the instructions provided to you by any third-party service providers to unsubscribe from their messages. If you have opted-out as described above, and thereafter you elect to initiate a transaction that requires us to share your information with such third party again, then your previous opt-out preferences will not apply.</p>

<p>If you would like to update your information or modify your communication preferences, please contact us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:marketing@bestwestern.co.uk">marketing@bestwestern.co.uk</a>, by phone on 01904 695482 or write to us at the following address:</p>

<p>Best Western reserves the right to change, modify, or amend this Policy at any time. The date this Policy was last revised is at the top of this page. If we make a material change to this Policy, we will indicate on the Site that our privacy practices have changed and will provide a link to the new policy. If we make material changes to how we use your Personal Information, we will notify you by e-mail to the e-mail address specified in your account (if applicable) and/or through a notice on the Site’s home page, and we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of such new or different use.
