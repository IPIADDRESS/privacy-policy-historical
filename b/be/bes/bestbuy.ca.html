<p><b>Our Privacy Commitment</b></p>

<p>At Best Buy we know how important it is to protect your personal information. Whether you are shopping with us online or in person we want to make every customer experience safe and secure. In keeping with that goal, we have developed this Privacy Policy to outline our guidelines for the collection and use of personal information by Best Buy.</p>

<p><b>Who is Best Buy?</b></p>

<b>Burnaby-based Best Buy Canada Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY).  This policy applies to Best Buy Canada Ltd, and all of its divisions.</b>

<p><b>What Information does Best Buy Collect and How is it Used?</b></p>

<p>At Best Buy, we collect two types of information: personal information and non-personal information.</p>

<p>With your consent we may use your personal information for a number of different purposes, for example to:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>fulfill requests for products, services or information;</li>
			<li>provide customer services;</li>
			<li>administer contests or promotions;</li>
			<li>offer new products and services;</li>
			<li>measure and improve the effectiveness of our Web Sites or our marketing endeavors; and</li>
			<li>tailor our online or in-store offerings to your preferences.</li>
		</ul>

<p>We may also collect and summarize customer information in a format that no longer identifies the individual for statistical purposes.</p>

<p>Personal information typically includes your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.  You can always choose not to provide us with any of your personal information. However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or information that you requested. For example, we can only offer you a credit card if you have provided us with certain financial information.</p>	

<p>Non-personal information does not identify you as an individual. For example, we may ask you for your postal code to assist us with planning our flyer distribution.</p>	
		
<p><b>Your Implied Consent</b></p>
<p>Your Implied Consent.  In some cases, your consent is implied if we ask you to provide personal information with a stated purpose.  For example, we can only deliver the product you have purchased if you provide us with your address and phone number.</p>

<p><b>Your Express Consent</b></p>
<p>In other cases, we will ask you to give your express consent to use your personal information to advise you of products or services that may be of interest.  You always have the opportunity to "opt out" of having your information used for this purpose. For example, when you subscribe to the Future Flash newsletter, we will also ask for your express consent to send you promotional information.</p>

<p><b>Withdrawing Your Consent</b></p>
<p>If you have "opted in" or subscribed to one of our newsletters or mailing lists, we will always provide you the opportunity to "opt out" or unsubscribe.  For example, each e-mail we send you will tell you how to decline further e-mail.</p>

<p><b><i>Information Best Buy Collects from You</i></b></p>

<p>Listed here are some examples of the ways that we collect information about you and how we use it.</p>

<p><b>In-Store Purchases</b></p>
<p>When you purchase a Best Buy product or service, you may need to provide us with contact and payment information (such as credit card information) so that we can process your request. Examples where we need contact information include delivery services, product servicing, in-home installations, extended warranty coverage, and rebate requests. If we collect this information, we will also ask for your consent to use this information to send you promotional information on products and services.</p>

<p><b>Applying for the Best Buy Credit Card</b></p>
<p>When you apply for a Best Buy credit card, certain contact and financial information is collected and reviewed by our credit card provider, currently Trans Canada Retail Services Company, to approve, establish and maintain credit card accounts. Each credit card provider has its own privacy policy which governs its relationship with you.  We encourage you to read their privacy statement provided on your credit card application.</p>
 
<p><b>Sign-Up for Newsletters or Updates</b></p>
<p>Best Buy also offers a variety of newsletters. To enroll, we will collect your contact information (such as name and e-mail address).  This information will only be used to send you the newsletter.</p>

<p><b>Rebates</b></p>
<p>Many of the products you purchase through Best Buy are offered with  rebates.  To claim your rebate, you will usually be asked to provide your name, address, e-mail address and proof of purchase.  You may also be asked by either Best Buy or the vendor to provide your consent to be added to promotional mailings and newsletters. Your consent is not a condition of receiving the rebate.</p>

<p><b>Participate in a Contest, Promotion, or Survey</b></p>
<p>From time to time, we may run contests, promotions, or surveys.  If you participate, you may be asked for contact information as well as additional optional survey information (for example, product preferences).  Information from contest entries will be used to contact you if you win.  We may also summarize survey information in a manner that no longer identifies the contest entrants for analysis, but will not share personal information from entries. All contests are subject to rules that will be available with each particular contest.</p>

<p><b><i>Information Best Buy Collects Automatically </i></b></p>

<p>Like many other Web sites, we automatically collect certain non-personal information regarding Web site users that does not identify you.  Examples include the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer, the IP address of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access the Web Site, the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to the Web Site, the operating system you are using, the sections of the Web Site you visit, the Web Site pages read and images viewed, and the content you download from the Web Site.</p>

<p>This non-personal information is used for Web Site and system administration purposes and to improve the Web Site.</p>
	
<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
<p>The Web Site uses "cookies", a technology that installs a small amount of information on a Web Site user's computer to permit the Web Site to recognize future visits using that computer.  Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the Web Site.  For example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous user of the Web Site (so you do not have to enter your billing information every time), to offer personalized Web page content and information for your use, to track your activity at the Web Site, to respond to your needs, and to otherwise facilitate your Web Site experience.  You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of the Web Site and your ability to access certain features of the Web Site or engage in transactions through the Web Site.</p>

<p><b>Tracking Information</b></p>
<p>We may use non-personal information to compile tracking information reports regarding Web Site user demographics, Web Site traffic patterns, and Web Site purchases, and then provide those reports to advertisers and others.  None of the tracking information in the reports can be connected to the identities or other personal information of individual users.  We may also link tracking information with personal information voluntarily provided by Web Site users.  Once such a link is made, all of the linked information is treated as personal information and will be used and disclosed only in accordance with this Policy.</p>

<p><b><i>Links to Other Web Sites</i></b></p>

<p>Our Web Site may contain links to other Web sites or Internet resources. When you click on one of those links you are contacting another Web site or Internet resource. Best Buy has no responsibility or liability for or control over those other Web sites or Internet resources or their collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.</p>

<p>We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those other sites to learn how they collect and use information about you.</p>

<p><b>Does Best Buy Share the Information it Collects?</b></p>

<p>Best Buy does not sell your personal information. However we may share your information with third parties acting on our behalf or as permitted or required by law.</p>

<p><b><i>Disclosure to Service Providers</i></b></p>

<p>Best Buy may share your personal information with certain service providers in order to provide products and services to you, to verify and validate information and to address customer service matters. Examples of service providers include credit card issuers, product service depots, warranty providers and delivery services.  To reduce the risk of fraud or misuse of personal information, Best Buy may also verify your personal information, including but not limited to your address and credit card information, with third party service providers.</p>

<p>We will use reasonable efforts to ensure that your personal information is used in a manner that is consistent with this Policy.  If you do not wish us to provide your personal information to those service providers, we may be unable to process your transaction.</p>

<p><b><i>Legal Disclosure</i></b></p>

<p>Best Buy may disclose your information as permitted or required to by law; for example:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>to a government institution or other person or entity that has asserted its lawful authority to obtain the   information; </li>
			<li>where we have reasonable grounds to believe the information could be useful in the investigation of unlawful activity;</li>
			<li>to comply with a subpoena or warrant or an order made by a court, person or entity with jurisdiction to compel the production of information;</li>
			<li>to comply with court rules regarding the production of records and information; and</li>
			<li>to our legal counsel.</li>
		</ul>
		
<p><b>How does Best Buy Protect My Information?</b></p>

<p>The security of your personal information is a high priority for Best Buy.  We maintain appropriate safeguards and current security standards to protect your personal information, whether recorded on paper or captured electronically, against unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse.</p>

<p>Although we cannot take responsibility for any theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction of data by a third party, we take reasonable precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.</p>

<p><b>How Can I Verify My Information?</b></p>

<p>You can ask to review any of the information that we have retained, how we have used it, and to whom we have disclosed it at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacymanager@bestbuycanada.ca">privacymanager@bestbuycanada.ca</a>.  Subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law, and provided we can authenticate your identity, you will be given reasonable access to your personal information, and will be entitled to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and to have it amended as appropriate.</p>

<p>You can also ask us to change your preferences regarding how we use or disclose your information, or let us know that you do not wish to receive any further communication from us.</p>

<p><b>When is My Information Removed?</b></p>

<p>We keep your information only as long as we need it for the products and services you're using and for a reasonable time thereafter or to meet any legal requirements.  We have retention standards that meet these requirements. We destroy your information when it is no longer needed, or we remove your personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>You can also request that we remove your information from our records. Subject to our requirements for continued retention of your information, for example, for billing, audit, or warranty purposes, we will make every reasonable effort to honour your request.</p>

<p><b>How Can I Contact Best Buy?</b></p>

<p>Best Buy is responsible for all personal information under its control.  Our Privacy Manager is accountable for Best Buy's compliance with the principles described here.  If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about the privacy policies stated here, you can:</p>

<p><b>Will this Privacy Policy Change?</b></p>

We may add, change, or remove portions of this Policy when we feel it is appropriate to do so.

3. <em>Cookies</em> - The Web Site uses "cookies", a technology that installs a small amount of information on a Web Site user's computer to permit the Web Site to recognize future visits using that computer.  Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the Web Site.  For example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous user of the Web Site (so you do not have to enter your personal information every time), to offer personalized Web page content and information for your use, to track your activity at the Web Site, to respond to your needs, and to otherwise facilitate your Web Site experience.  Advertisements displayed on the Web Site may also contain cookies or other technologies.  Those advertisements may be provided by third party advertising companies, and Best Buy does not have any control over, or any responsibility or liability for, the use and disclosure of information collected through advertisement cookies.  You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of the Web Site and your ability to access certain features of the Web Site or engage in transactions through the Web Site.<br><br>

4. <em>Tracking Information</em> - Best Buy may use non-personal information to create aggregate tracking information reports regarding Web Site user demographics, Web Site traffic patterns, and Web Site purchases, and then provide those reports to advertisers and others.  None of the tracking information in the reports can be connected to the identities or other personal information of individual users.  Best Buy also may link tracking information with personal information voluntarily provided by Web Site users.  Once such a link is made, all of the linked information is treated as personal information and will be used and disclosed only in accordance with this Policy.<br><br>

<li><em>Law Enforcement and Legal Disclosure</em> - Best Buy may disclose your personal information to a government institution or other person or entity that has asserted its lawful authority to obtain the information or where Best Buy has reasonable grounds to believe the information could be useful in the investigation of unlawful activity, or to comply with a subpoena or warrant or an order made by a court, person or entity with jurisdiction to compel the production of information, or to comply with court rules regarding the production of records and information, or to Best Buy's legal counsel.<br><br>
</ol>

9. <em>Securing Your Information</em> - To help protect the confidentiality of your personal information, Best Buy employs security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.
