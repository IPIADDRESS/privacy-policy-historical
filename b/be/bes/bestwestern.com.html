<p><a name="Protect" id="Protect"></a><b>How We Protect Personal Information</b></p>
<p>No method of transmission over the Internet or of electronic storage is fully secure. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of any breach to your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.</p>
<p>Some of our websites permit you to create an account. When you do you will be prompted to create a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else that has obtained your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by you. You should notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account.</p>
<p><a name="Retain" id="Retain"></a><b>How Long We Retain Information</b></p>
<p>We retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. For example, we retain BWR information for as long as an individual remains a BWR member because BWR points do not expire and the information is needed in order to allow the individual to redeem their rewards. We retain information in our reservation system, in full or in summary form, for three years following a guest’s departure in order to process your reservation, provide post-reservation customer support, and provide invoicing and recordkeeping. We typically retain information in our customer care complaint system for three years after receipt, unless the information is needed for an ongoing purpose such as to address an open issue.&nbsp;</p>

BWI has submitted its self-certification that it adheres to the Privacy Shield principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. If there is any conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principals shall apply. Once your information is received in the United States, if BWI transmits it to a processor outside of the EEA, BWI will take steps to ensure that the processor complies with the substantive principles of the GDPR and/or Privacy Shield. If you would like more information concerning the protections applied for a particular onward transfer you can contact us using the information below.

After receiving such written description, a representative from BWI's Customer Care Department will contact you to set up a time and manner to discuss your complaint.
