        This Privacy Policy ("<strong>Policy</strong>") describes the policies
        and practices of BadPopcorn, Inc. d/b/a Beyond The Whiteboard, a
        California corporation ("<strong>we</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>")
        as to the collection, use and disclosure of information that we collect
        from you when you visit, access, use or download our (1) website(s)
        located at
        <a href="https://beyondthewhiteboard.com">https://beyondthewhiteboard.com</a>,
        <a href="https://btwb.com">https://btwb.com</a> and
        <a href="https://crossfitbtwb.com">https://crossfitbtwb.com</a>
        (such websites collectively the "<strong>Website</strong>") and/or (2)
        mobile software applications on the Android and iOS platforms, made
        available to the public under the names <strong><em>Beyond The
        Whiteboard</em></strong> and <strong><em>CrossFit btwb</em></strong>. Together, this
        Policy refers to these mobile apps and our Website as the
        "<strong>Service</strong>"). By visiting, accessing, using, downloading
        or creating an account with the Service, you agree to be bound by our <a href="https://beyondthewhiteboard.com/terms">Mobile Application and
        Website User Agreement</a>. We will not use or share your Collected
        Information (as defined below) with anyone except as described in this
        Policy.
      </p>

      <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">
        The Purpose of the Policy
      </h3>
      <p>
        We take your privacy seriously. We provide this Policy so that you
        understand how we treat the information that you provide us as you
        use the Service ("<strong>Collected Information</strong>").
      </p>
      <p>
        This Policy applies only to information collected via the Service. It
        may not apply to information that we may collect offline (for example,
        via phone calls). We reserve the right to change this Policy at any
        time. Any material changes, modifications, additions or deletions will
        be effective immediately as soon as we give you notice of them, which we
        may do by means including but not limited to issuing an email to the
        email address listed by registered users and/or posting the revised
        Policy on this page. It is your responsibility to review this Policy
        periodically and to be aware of any modifications. Your continued use of
        the Service after any modification means that you acknowledge the change
        and consent to the practices that we disclose in the Policy.
      </p>

      <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">
        How We Collect Information
      </h3>
      <p>We collect information in these ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong><u>User-Provided Information.</u></strong>
          We ask users to manually provide us with their name, email address and
          other contact information, social media links, free-form information
          about themselves, birthdate and gender information, and credit-card
          payment information when they create an account. They also have the
          option to upload a photo of themselves to appear in the Service. At
          other times during your use of the Service, we may also give you the
          opportunity to provide us with other information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><u>Automatically Collected Information.</u></strong>
          When you use the Service, we may automatically collect or generate
          information including but not limited to the Internet Protocol ("IP")
          address of your computer; web pages that you access within the
          Service; geographic information; a unique user ID; the type of
          browser, device or operating system you use; the version of our
          software that you are using; referring services or websites; search
          information; and usage and browsing information.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We refer to all of the information described in this section as
        "<strong>Collected Information</strong>."
      </p>

      <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">
        How We Use Collected Information
      </h3>
      <p>
        We use Collected Information to deliver services to you, and for
        communicating with you about the Service. We will never use your
        personally identifiable information for our own purposes, except as
        expressly described in this Policy or in our
        <a href="https://beyondthewhiteboard.com/terms">Mobile Application and Website User Agreement</a>.
        If we use your email address to communicate with you (with the exception
        of transactional emails regarding your use of the Service), we will
        provide you with the option to unsubscribe or opt out of future emails.
      </p>

      <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">
        How We Disclose Collected Information to Others
      </h3>
      <p>
        We will not sell, rent, license or disclose Collected Information to
        anyone, except:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          to Partners (as defined in our
          <a href="https://beyondthewhiteboard.com/terms">Mobile Application and Website User Agreement</a>);
        </li>
        <li>
          where necessary for us to work with other third-party companies that
          we use to provide the Service ("<strong>Third-Party
          Services</strong>," detailed below);
        </li>
        <li>
          in response to a court order or where required by law;
        </li>
        <li>
          to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or illegal conduct, or
          suspected violations of our
          <a href="https://beyondthewhiteboard.com/terms">Mobile Application and Website User Agreement</a>; or
        </li>
        <li>
          to disclose to another company in the course of a business
          acquisition, merger or sale of assets.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Pursuant to our agreement with CrossFit, Inc., a Delaware corporation
        ("<strong>CrossFit</strong>"), we may also share some of your Collected
        Information with CrossFit without separate prior notice to you. If we do
        so, we will only share your Collected Information in anonymized form
        (i.e. in a way that does not allow CrossFit or any other person or
        organization to determine your personal identity) and we will not share
        any of your financial payment information. CrossFit may (by itself or
        together with us) publish reports about the behavior of our users based
        on the information that we may share with CrossFit. Any such reports
        would not be able to identify any particular one of our members
        personally (by name or otherwise) because of our policy against sharing
        non-anonymized information with CrossFit or any other third party.
      </p>
