        This Privacy Policy describes the Personal Information we obtain from you, what
        we do with your Personal Information, the safeguard measures we, or our Affiliate
        has in place to protect it, and to what extent you can control our use of such Personal
        Information. By using the Web Site, the user agrees, without limitation or qualification,
        to be bound by this Privacy Statement.</p>

        When you purchase e-books, audios and videos on our Web Site, you must submit payment
        information directly to Clickbank, including your credit or debit card number, as
