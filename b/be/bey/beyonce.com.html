<p>Beyonce.com Privacy Policy</p>

<p>THIS IS THE BEYONCE.COM OFFICIAL PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH IS PART OF OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND FORMS A PART OF YOUR LEGAL AGREEMENT WITH US. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY, SINCE IT DESCRIBES THE TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION, THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE DISCLOSE OR SHARE INFORMATION AND HOW YOU CAN ACCESS, UPDATE OR DELETE CERTAIN INFORMATION WE HAVE COLLECTED ABOUT YOU.</p> 

<p>What Information Do We Collect?</p>  

<p>We and any third party we engage for the purpose of administering, operating, hosting, configuring, designing, maintaining and providing internal support for our Website and Content (collectively, the “operational service providers”) collect certain non-personally identifiable information from you when you visit our Website (see Do you use cookies? below).  We only collect Personal Information from you when you submit it to us or provide it to us, such as when you email us.  We use the term “Personal Information” to refer to any information you provide in connection with your use of our Website by which you can be personally identified. Personal Information may include such things as your name, street address, telephone number, date of birth, e-mail address and any other information which might reasonably be used to identify you.</p>

<p>Unless you voluntarily provide or send us Personal Information, we will always ask you to submit or provide it to us before collecting your Personal Information.  If you provide or submit your Personal Information to us we will always give you the right to review, update and/or delete your Personal Information, subject to our obligations to comply with legal, regulatory, internal audit and record-keeping requirements.</p>

<p>How Do We Use Your Information?</p> 

<p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used to:</p> 
	<p>•	Personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs);</p> 
	<p>•	Improve our Website (we continually strive to improve our Website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you);</p> 
	<p>•	Improve customer service (your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs);</p>
	<p>•	Administer a contest, promotion, survey or other Website features;</p> 
	<p>•	Send periodic communications (such as to respond to inquiries, requests or to provide you with news or other updates).</p>  

<p>Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future email communications, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.</p>

<p>How Do We Protect Your Information?</p> 

<p>We maintain commercially reasonable standards of security and confidentiality.  We also try to limit information access to individuals who need to have such access to perform their responsibilities associated with our Website and the Content on our Website.  However, the Internet and communications cannot be guaranteed to be secure and it is possible that others may unlawfully intercept or access information, transmissions or communications to, from or within our Website.</p>

<p>Do We Use Cookies?</p> 

<p>When you access our Website, we and our operational service providers and others who host our Website often use technology that can recognize, collect and/or transmit information that is associated with you, but which do not personally identify you. Although the term “cookie” specifically refers to a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes, we will use the term “cookie” to refer generically to any technology that can recognize, collect and/or transmit information about your visits to our Website. This type of information includes such data as the Internet or web domain that referred you, the type of operating system and browser you are using, the date and time of your visit, data relating to activities on our Website (e.g., so-called ‘clickstream’ data) and other technological attributes about your visit to our Website. This information is used to analyze trends, administer our Website, track user movements on our Websites, and gather aggregate demographic information about visitors so we can continually improve our Website.</p> 

<p>Cookies also allow our Website to recognize your computer or access device each time you visit and cookies can keep count of how often you return. Cookies can also track how you use our Website and your preferences for features and functions, and cookies can store information such as your user name and password so that you don’t have to re-enter them each time you return to visit.  Cookies don’t personally identify you or any particular user or individual.</p> 

<p>You can disable or turn the cookie feature off by changing the settings on your Internet browser and you can also change the settings to stop your browser from automatically accepting cookies. Although changing these settings may not affect your ability to browse, it may affect your ability to use certain features and functions of our Website and it may also require you to re-enter certain information each time you visit or attempt to use our Website. You should consult the operating instructions that apply to your browser to determine how to best configure your browser settings for your needs.</p>

<p>Do We Disclose Any Information to Third Parties?</p>

<p>We do not sell, rent, lease, provide or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to unaffiliated entities. We will always let you know if we intend to provide any of your Personal Information to an unaffiliated third party and we will ask you to consent (“opt-in”) whenever we intend to do so.</p> 

<p>We always have the right to disclose your Personal Information to our operational service providers. We always request that our operational service providers protect your privacy and not disclose your Personal Information to third party marketers that are not associated with our Website, nor are they permitted to use your Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes.</p>  

<p>We also reserve the right to make your Personal Information available:</p>
	<p>•	When we are compelled by a governmental agency, law, regulation, a court or other legal process;</p> 
	<p>•	If we believe you are, have or may violate any law, regulation, our Terms and Conditions;</p>
	<p>•	If we believe you are or may be a threat to safety, property, interests or rights of us or others;</p>
	<p>•	In order to investigate, respond to or resolve problems or inquiries or defend our interests;</p>
	<p>•	In a merger, acquisition, change of control, joint venture or other business combination.</p> 

<p>We reserve the right to disclose your non-personally identifiable visitor information to third parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>

Third parties often also employ cookies to measure advertising effectiveness. You should be aware that even if you encounter an advertisement, link or reference to a Third Party Website on our Website and even if we have a relationship with them, we do not control them, their websites or their policies and practices regarding use of their websites, transaction policies or any rules they have regarding the use of cookies or collection, use or disclosure of your information (including Personal Information). These are within their control and not ours and the terms and conditions, as well as the privacy policies that apply to these third parties and their websites are their responsibility. We have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of Third Party Websites.</p>
