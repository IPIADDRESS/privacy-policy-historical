POLICY</b></small></p>

Business Building Shortcuts, LLC strives to offer its visitors the many
advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and
personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information
(your
name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the
terms of
this privacy policy. We will treat your information with care, and
never&nbsp;barter or rent your email
address to
any unauthorized third party.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      <b>How we gather information from users</b><br>

      <br>

How we collect and store information depends on the page you are
visiting, the
activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided.
For
example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for
access
to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as
newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information
when you
participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms,
and
other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, Business
Building
Shortcuts, LLC also collects information automatically and through the
use of
electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example,
we may
log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology
to
recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things,
the
cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having
to
re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the
number of
times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site.
As we
adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through
other
means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with
information, for
example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you
do you
may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to
re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to
customize the
siteâ€™s features according to your preferences.<br>

      <br>

      <b>What we do with the information we collect</b><br>

      <br>

Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit
and
deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your
privacy
and do not share your information with anyone.<br>

      <br>

Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify
you) may
be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about
your usage
patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help
enhance our
site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what
features
are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared
with
our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not
include
any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to
identify
you individually.<br>

      <br>

We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on Business
Building
Shortcuts, LLC to communicate with you about your registration and
customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy;
services
and products offered by Business Building Shortcuts, LLC and other
topics we
think you might find of interest. <br>

      <br>

Personally Identifiable Information collected by Business Building
Shortcuts,
LLC may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to
site
administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,
administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications
with you.
Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation
of our
site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information.
We will
use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time
to time
as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or
partner with
other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information
may be
among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in
response
to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably
required to
do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe
to us,
and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate
or
necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to
disclosure
in such cases.<br>

      <br>

      <b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b><br>

      <br>

Business Building Shortcuts, LLC expects its partners, advertisers and
affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that
third
