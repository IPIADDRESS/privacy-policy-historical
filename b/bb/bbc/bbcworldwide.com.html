<h2><strong>Privacy at BBC Worldwide</strong></h2>

<p><em>Last updated: 15 June 2015</em></p>

<p>BBC Worldwide Limited (BBCW) is the main commercial arm and a
wholly owned subsidiary of the British Broadcasting Corporation
(BBC). It is a UK based company operating in countries around the
world through its subsidiaries. The information in these pages
relate to the privacy practices of the companies in the BBC
Worldwide group, (herein referred to as "BBCW", "we", "our" or
"us").</p>

<p>BBCW respects your right to privacy and we take our related
legal obligations seriously. We aim to be transparent at all times
about our treatment of your information. You can read the full
policy below for details about how your information will be used,
when it may be disclosed to others and your rights in relation to
the information we hold. If you find reading a policy a bit
daunting or if you just want a quick snapshot of our approach then
we suggest you start with <a href="#Promise"><em>Our
Promise</em></a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Who we are</strong></h3>

<p>BBCW exists to support the BBC's public service mission and to
maximise profits on its behalf. We do this through investing in,
commercialising and showcasing BBC content around the world, in a

TV channels, online shops, websites, games, mobile apps and live
events. For more information please refer to our corporate website

<h3><strong>Our Promise</strong> <strong></strong></h3>

<ol>
<li>We will comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws
and regulatory frameworks.</li>

<li>We will only use your personal information to supply, improve
and manage our services. Any additional or unusual uses of your
information will be explained at the point of collection.</li>

<li>We will only send you marketing emails if you have permitted us
to (and you will be given the opportunity to unsubscribe in each of
our emails).</li>

<li>We will enable you to opt-out of usage tracking where possible;
we track your use of our services to help us to tailor our content
and advertising and to improve our services. We will not use
information that identifies you personally but if you prefer, you
may opt-out <a href="/cookies.aspx"><strong>here</strong></a>.</li>

<li>We will not share personally identifiable information with
unrelated third parties for their own use without your consent. We
may share your information within our group of companies so that we

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>1. <strong>SCOPE OF THIS POLICY AND YOUR CONSENT<a id="scope" name="scope"></a></strong></h3>

<p>This policy governs our processing of your information in
relation to the products and services we supply to you. In addition
to this policy, we operate policies relating to our use of <a href="/cookies.aspx"><strong>Cookies
(Tracking Technologies)</strong></a> and the provision of our
services via <a href="/privacy/mobile-apps.aspx"><strong>
Mobile Applications</strong></a> ("Mobile Apps"). The practices set
out in those policies are governed by this overarching policy.</p>

<p>Please be aware that we also license our brands and content to
other companies who may produce their own websites, events and
digital content. We take reasonable steps to ensure that these
companies clearly identify themselves and handle your information
appropriately. However, when you use any service which is operated
by a third party, the use of your information will be subject to
their privacy policy and not ours. If you have any concerns, please
contact us at: <a href="mailto:dataprotection@bbc.com">dataprotection@bbc.com</a>.</p>

<p>Your use of our services constitutes your consent to the
processing of your information described herein.</p>

<h3>2. <strong>INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT<a id="types" name="types"></a></strong></h3>

<p>The type of information we collect will depend on the
circumstances and the service you are using. For example, to sign
up to a newsletter we may only need your name and email address but
if you want to attend one of our events we may need to know your
contact details, payment information and any access or dietary
requirements. Generally speaking, we will collect information
relating to you and/or your use of our services in the following
ways:</p>

<h4><em>Personal information provided by you</em>:</h4>

<p>This is usually information that identifies you as an individual
or that enables us to contact you and can include your name, home
and/or delivery address, telephone number, e-mail address, data of
birth, demographical information, interests, preferences, payment
information and photos or video footage. It can also include
information that we have not requested but which you have
volunteered, such as information provided during interactions with
our customer service agents or via comments or other submissions
you have made to our online services, such as online forums.</p>

<p>In some circumstances you might provide us with information
about other individuals, for example when using a 'send to a
friend' feature or submitting a photo that includes their image.
You must ensure you (1) have their permission to provide their
information to us; and (2) you have made them aware of the terms of
this privacy policy.</p>

<h4><em>Information collected automatically during your use of our
services:</em></h4>

<p>When you use our services we automatically record information
about your usage of those services, your interaction with our
adverts and our emails as well as information about the device you
are using and your internet connection. We do this in two ways:</p>

<p>Log data: When you use our services, certain information gets
recorded in our log files such as your device's Internet Protocol
(IP) Address, its unique ID, its operating system and location, and
your browser type, the pages you viewed, cookie information and
referral links (the link that sent you to a particular page).</p>

<p>Tracking technologies (cookies): In conjunction with our log
data we may use tracking technologies such as tags on our web pages
and small data files which we store on your device (known as
"cookies"). These technologies enable us to recognise your device
and to track your interaction with our services, emails and
adverts. We do not use these technologies to identify you and we do
not intentionally collect or record personally identifiable
information through these technologies. See our <a href="/cookies.aspx"><strong>Cookies
Policy</strong></a> for more information.</p>

<h4><em>Information collected via social media and other third
parties:</em></h4>

<p>When you choose to participate in or receive a service from us
via social media, for example by entering a competition or playing
a game on our social pages, we may collect information from you
directly or the social network may share with us personal
information about you. This can consist of information such as your
name, profile picture, gender, e-mail address and date of birth.
Please keep in mind that any information provided to us via a third
party may also be subject to that third party's privacy policy.</p>

<h4><em>Information collected via specialist data
companies:</em></h4>

<p>We sometimes use specialist data companies to provide us with
information they hold about you to enable us to better tailor our
advertising. For example, we might use anonymous information about
your browsing on other sites to enable us to infer your interests
and to put you into appropriate "market segments". This information
is not used to identify you as a person and we do not attempt to
combine it with personally identifying information that we may
hold. See our <a href="/cookies.aspx"><strong>Cookies
Policy</strong></a> for more information.</p>

<h3><strong>3.</strong> <strong>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION<a id="use" name="use"></a></strong></h3>

<p>We will use your information: (i) to deliver, improve and
personalise our services to you in accordance with your
preferences: and (ii) for our own legitimate business purposes and
needs. Specifically, we may use your information to:</p>

<ul>
<li>fulfil your product orders or to provide the service or
information you have requested;</li>

<li>administer your account(s);</li>

<li>send you service related communications;</li>

services;</li>

brands and services and special promotions from our trusted
partners in accordance with your email preferences; and</li>

<li>manage our email suppression list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where BBCW proposes using your personal information for any
other uses we will ensure that we notify you first. You will also
be given the opportunity to withhold or withdraw your consent for
your use other than as listed above.</p>

<h3><strong>4.</strong> <strong>SHARING &amp; DISCLOSING YOUR
INFORMATION<a id="sharing" name="sharing"></a></strong></h3>

<h4><em>Information shared among BBCW Group Companies</em></h4>

<p>To improve your experience of our services and brands,
information about your use of our services may be shared between
BBCW group companies for the purposes of research, analysis,
marketing and ad-serving. In addition, a BBCW company may provide
data processing services on behalf of other companies within the
group. For example, most of our newsletter subscription services
are managed by the parent company, BBC Worldwide Limited, which is
headquartered in the UK.</p>

<h4><em>Information shared with our suppliers</em></h4>

<p>We use a number of third parties to perform business functions
on our behalf, such as sending our newsletters, hosting our online
services, providing our customer services and fulfilling product
orders and processing payments. We only disclose the information
necessary to enable these third parties to perform their services.
Our suppliers are contracted to comply with our instructions and we
require that they do not use your personal information for their
own business purposes.</p>

<h4><em>Information shared via third party social buttons, widgets
and other embedded content</em></h4>

<p>Some of our online services carry embedded content controlled by
third parties for services such as social sharing, recommended
stories, commenting/reviewing, and displaying video or images. When
you interact with these services they may collect information from
and about you and your interaction with their content. This
activity will be subject to the privacy policy of and your settings
for your chosen network. Please be aware that they may track your
activity, through the use of cookies or similar technology, without
you needing to interact with them. If this concerns you, ensure you
log out of their services before using ours.</p>

<h4><em>Information shared with other parties</em></h4>

<p>Generally, we will only disclose your data to other parties with
your consent, for example if you choose to share content via social
media functionality. We may also disclose your personal information
to law enforcement agencies, government/regulatory bodies, internet
service providers and content protection organizations as required
or allowed by law. For example, if you post inappropriate or
objectionable content on our services or where we reasonably
believe you may be in breach of the law, we may report your content
and behaviour to relevant parties.</p>

<h4><em>Sale or transfer of all or part of our business or
assets</em></h4>

<p>We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in
the event we sell or transfer all or a part of our business or
assets so that the buyer can continue to offer you the online
services. We will make reasonable efforts to provide you with
advance notification of the transfer of your information in such
circumstances.</p>

<h3><strong>5.</strong> <strong>WHERE WE WILL STORE AND USE YOUR
INFORMATION<a id="Where" name="Where"></a></strong></h3>

<p>As described in the previous section, we may share your
information with other companies in the BBCW group or with
contracted third party service providers. These companies may be
located in, or use IT equipment located in, countries different to
that in which your information is collected. Where this is the
case, we will take steps to ensure that your information receives
an equivalent level of protection.</p>

<p>BBC Worldwide is a global company which is headquartered in the
United Kingdom (UK). Your information may be processed in the UK
and other locations globally including in the United States where

law enforcement in the US.</p>

INFORMATION<a id="Retention" name="Retention"></a></strong></h3>

long as is necessary for the relevant service or as long as is set

store any personal information from children under the age of 13.

<p>We maintain appropriate organisational and technological
safeguards to help protect against loss, misuse or unauthorised
access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the information we
hold about you. We also seek to ensure our service providers do the
same. Unfortunately, no system can be guaranteed as completely
secure and there is an inherent risk in transmitting information
over the internet. It may be possible for an unrelated party to
intercept or access such transmissions unlawfully.</p>

<p>If you believe that your personal information under our control
has been compromised, including access to any accounts you hold
with our services, please contact us immediately using the details

related messages.</p>
