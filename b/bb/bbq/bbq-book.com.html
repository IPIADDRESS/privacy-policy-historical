                    <p>Advertisements that appear on this Site are delivered to users by our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may download cookies to your computer. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time
                        they send you an advertisement. In this way, they may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. This information allows
                        an advertising network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Network 6000 does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. </p>
