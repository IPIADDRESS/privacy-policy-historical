This Policy provides information regarding your choices to either Opt-out or Opt-in when your Personal Information is used for various promotional and marketing purposes by the Station, Site, its corporate affiliates, and/or our generous advertisers, sponsors, or promotional partners (collectively, “Advertisers”). For example, for the Station, Site or our corporate affiliates use of your Personal Information for marketing and promotional purposes, we provide you with the right to Opt-out.

              <p align="left"><font color="#333333" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unless stated otherwise, we do not request contact information for a mobile phone, text messaging or any wireless device that includes a domain name address (such as “.net” or “.com”) as part of the contact information. Federal law prohibits the sending of commercial email messages directly to a wireless device that uses a domain name, unless you have first given your affirmative consent. We may inadvertently collect a wireless device number that includes a domain name when you send us an inquiry or register for a contest or membership club. However, we will not knowingly use that contact information for sending commercial email. We reserve the right to respond to user inquiries or requests sent via a wireless device that uses a domain name as such messages are not deemed to be commercial email and therefore, are not regulated by Federal law. However, when “computer to phone” commercial emails are prohibited by law, we may reject your wireless device contact information when such information is submitted for certain Site features or services. We will attempt to notify you if we will need new contact information.</font></p>

Therefore, we may also use your Personal Information for the marketing of events, products or services of our generous Advertisers. There are two ways users may receive such information from Advertisers, either indirectly via newsletters, email or direct mail from the Site, or directly from the Advertiser. We may use one or both methods depending on the activity and the Advertiser. <br>

              <p align="left"><font color="#333333" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When we plan to share your Personal Information with Advertisers, you will receive such notice on the Site, in the rules of participation (“Rules of Participation”) for the activity or event, or via an email notice. However, please be informed that our Advertisers may not have the same privacy policies that we do. Therefore, we will ask you for your consent first to receive marketing information directly from our Advertisers. You will need to check the “Opt-in” click boxes that may be located on the registration area for the particular activity or event, in an email, or notify the Site’s Privacy Administrator. However, if you do not wish to receive marketing or promotional materials from the Site and/or Station, you will need to tell us so by clicking the “Opt-Out” click boxes that may be included on the registration area for the particular event, or alternatively, notify the Site’s Privacy Administrator. Please note that this notification process is different than the one for Advertisers.<br>

              <p align="left"><font color="#333333" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also provide you with an option to “Opt-out” of receiving advertising and promotional email from us in compliance with federal law by installing an Opt-out mechanism with all such email messages. You must use the designated method in the email message to notify us of your Opt-out request, as we cannot guarantee that other methods of notification will be effective or timely. Please be aware that we may continue to contact you via email for administrative or informational purposes, including follow-up messages regarding contests you have entered or other transactions you have undertaken. By law, such messages are not considered to be commercial email.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font color="#333333" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The use of cookies is an industry standard and they are currently used on most websites, including this Site. Cookies are a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a website to the hard drive of a user’s computer so that the website administrator or a third party operational service provider may identify the computer and passively track the user’s activities on the website. Image tags work in conjunction with cookies and are small image files that may be located on select pages of our Site, or with-in web-based email newsletters that we may send. (Image tags are also called web beacons, web bugs, clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs.) Tracking is important because we can better understand what parts of our website are used the most, when to launch new services and how to enhance current offerings. We may share the information we receive from cookies and image tags with third-parties and our Advertisers in aggregate form, which means that such information does not contain specific Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information about any one visitor.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#333333" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In short, cookies and image tags collect a user’s Internet protocols and server information. Such data files allow our Site to remember your web browser when you visit our Site and are necessary tools for quick and efficient access to membership clubs, awards programs and contests. A cookie will not allow the Site to learn any Personal Information (such as your real name and email address) or Sensitive Personal Information that you have not otherwise disclosed. Cookies and image tags allow the Site to remember important information that will make the Site easier for you to use and helpful in our administration of various activities. We do not use cookies or image tags to collect other Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information unless you give us permission to do so.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#333333" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie or image tag is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all such devices. This is done through your browser. If you turn cookies off, you may not have access to many features at our Site that make your Internet experience more efficient and enjoyable – like the features mentioned above – and some of our other services will not function properly.</font></p>

Except for the limited circumstances listed below, we will automatically reject and delete the registration or entry of any person we believe in good faith to be underage.

Sensitive Personal Information will be encrypted or collected though a secured Internet connection generally via SSL or S-HTTP protocols. Such Sensitive Personal Information will also be stored in a commercially reasonable secure manner. We may use your Personal Information, (but not your credit card or debit card number) to contact you about future products, services and discounts from the Station or to provide such information indirectly from our Advertisers, unless you tell us otherwise (“Opt-out”).

                    This Privacy Policy does not cover third party advertising or third party content that may be present on the Site. This Site may provide banner and general advertising, in addition to other content provided by our Advertisers or operational service providers.

  This Site often provides links to third party websites that could be of interest to our users, including the websites of our Advertisers. As stated in our Terms of Use Agreement, the Station does not own or control these websites and therefore, is not responsible for the content, business practices, nor operations of such websites. Third party websites linked on this Site may have different privacy policies and business practices than we do. The presence of a link to a third party website does not constitute or imply our endorsement, recommendation, or sponsorship of the third party content, goods, or services available through, or contained on, the Site.

If Personal Information collected off-line will be used by the Station, its parent company(s), or corporate affiliates for promotional and marketing purposes, you will have the opportunity to Opt-out of such use. If such information will be shared with Advertisers, you will have the same rights as provided for the disclosure of Personal Information collected online.
