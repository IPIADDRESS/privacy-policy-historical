            This document was last updated May 12, 2007.<br>    
            <br>
            At Dr. 5Z5 Open Feed Directory, we are committed to protecting your privacy and to developing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience. You can travel through most of our site without giving us any information about yourself. But sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request, and this statement of privacy explains data collection and use in those situations. Please read the complete 5Z5.COM privacy statement.&nbsp;<br>    
            <br>
            <br>
            Collecting your Personal Information<br>     
            We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are asked to register before entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, joining a limited-access premium site, or when purchasing and registering Dr. 5Z5 Open Feed Directory products. Personal information collected by 5Z5.COM often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested.&nbsp;<br>    
            <br>
            For example: If you choose to make a purchase in the Shop area of the Web site, we will request personal information such as: name, address, telephone number, credit card number and shipping information.&nbsp;<br>    
            <br>
            When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we keep this registration information on file with any information you've already given us on previous visits to our Web site. This is considered your personal profile.&nbsp;<br>    
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            Use of your Personal Information<br>     
            We use your personal information for four primary purposes:&nbsp;<br>    
            To make the site easier for you to use by not making you enter your personal information more than once.&nbsp;<br>    
            To help you quickly find software, services or information on  
5Z5.COM.&nbsp;<br>
            To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you.&nbsp;<br>    
            To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from    
            Dr. 5Z5 Open Feed Directory.&nbsp;<br>
            We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.&nbsp;<br>

            <br>

            Subscribe or cancel subscriptions to newsletters about our services and products.&nbsp;<br>    
            <br>
            <br>
