		<p><strong>5280 Magazine Online Subscription Privacy Policy</strong><br>
		Welcome to 5280 Magazine's website. This privacy policy describes how we treat the information you choose to provide through this site. 
		Please take a few moments to read this privacy policy carefully. Should you have any questions about our privacy practices, please send an email to webmaster@5280.com.</p>

		<p><strong>What personal information will we collect?</strong><br>
		We will collect information that identifies you ("personal information") only when you voluntarily provide it to us. For example, when you decide to 
		subscribe online for our magazine, or to complete an online survey, we may ask you to provide some personal information, such as your first and last name, 
		mailing address and/or email address. When we collect such information, we will make every effort to link to this privacy policy.</p>

		<p><strong>How will we use this information?</strong><br>
		We will use this personal information to fulfill your online requests. For example, if you subscribe online for our magazine, we will use your personal 
		information to process your request and to send you your magazine. We also may use this information to notify you of special offers, new products 
		and other services about which you might be interested if you opted in on the order form. If at any time you decide that you do not wish to 
		receive these types of communications, simply follow the unsubscribe features contained in any email from us or change your preferences on the 
		Your Subscription page of our website. We may use this information in aggregate form in various ways; for example, to help us evaluate and modify 
		existing services, and to help us develop additional services that are likely to be of interest to our users. 5280 Magazine may do research on our users' 
		demographics, interests and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files and from 
		surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. 5280 Magazine may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners. 
		Under confidentiality agreements, 5280 Magazine may match aggregated user information with third party data. Also, 5280 Magazine may disclose aggregated 
		user statistics in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.</p>

		<p><strong>With whom will we share this information?</strong><br>
		We will share your personal information with companies that assist in fulfilling subscriptions or provide contractual services for us. For example, 
		we allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance or forums software, but only for the 
		purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide you with those services. Any third party that has access to our database for this purpose is bound 
		by the terms set forth in this policy. If you opted in on the order form, we also may share your personal information that we collect online with our 
		current or future affiliated companies and with select third parties that may email you information or special offerings about products or services 
		that we believe may be of interest to you. It is your choice to allow us to disclose your personal information to third parties for this purpose, and 
		your choice will not affect the cost of your service. This free choice also applies to personal information that we collect from you offline and you 
		can choose not to have information shared by us with third parties for marketing by calling, writing, or e-mailing us. In any event, please note that 
		we will not share your credit card information for these marketing purposes. Finally, we may be required to disclose personal information by law or 
		legal process, to protect and defend the rights or property of 5280 Magazine or to protect the personal safety of our website users and customers. 
		We reserve the right to contact appropriate authorities when activities that are illegal or violate our policies are taking place on our website.</p>

		<p><strong>How we protect this information?</strong><br>
		We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access through the use of encryption and network firewalls. 
		We also safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access by limiting the number of employees permitted to access such information, 
		and by having in place processes for disciplinary action where appropriate. However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is 
		impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted 
		while being transmitted to us over the internet.</p>

		<p><strong>Internet Protocol Addresses</strong><br>
		An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. If you request pages from 
		this site, our server will enter your IP address into a log. We may use this information to measure site traffic for purposes of system administration 
		and for our sponsors. This information generally is not linked to any personal information, however, in some cases, it may be possible to contact a 
		user through his or her IP address. Although it is not our policy to attempt such contact, and not to release this information to third parties, we 
		reserve the right to use this information to identify and, when appropriate, prosecute anyone who threatens our service, site, customers and/or others. 
		We also may release logged information to comply with any legal process.</p>

		<p><strong>What about kids?</strong><br>
		We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected 
		any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible.</p>

		<p><strong>External Links</strong><br>
		Our website may provide links to various websites that we do not control. When you click on one of these links, you will be transferred 
		from our site and connected to the website of the organization or company that you selected. Even if an affiliation exists between this 
		site and another site, we exercise no control over linked sites. Each of these linked sites maintains its own independent privacy and 
		data collection policies and procedures. If you visit a website that is linked to this site, you should consult that site's privacy 
		policy before providing those sites with any of your personal information.</p>

		<p><strong>Terms, Changes and Questions</strong><br>
		By providing personal information through this website, you signify your agreement to the terms of our privacy policy. If you do not agree 
		with these terms, please do not disclose any personal information through this site.</p>

		<p>You will be responsible for all charges incurred while your account is being used, if any, including payment for any goods or services.</p>

		<p>This service is available "as is." We do not warrant that this service will be uninterrupted or error-free. We are not responsible for the 
		availability or content of other services that may be linked to this service. We do not make any warranties, express or implied, including 
		without limitation, those of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, with respect to this service. We reserve the right to 
		correct any errors or omissions in this service. Although we intend to take reasonable steps to prevent the introduction of viruses, worms, 
		"Trojan horses" or other destructive materials to this service, we do not guarantee or warrant that this service or materials that may be 
		downloaded from this service do not contain such destructive features. We are not liable for any damages or harm attributable to such features.</p>

		<p>Technology on the Internet is developing at a rapid pace, and we need to maintain our flexibility in the online arena. If we need to change our 
		policy in the future, we will post these changes as soon as they go into effect.</p>

		<p>If you have any questions or comments about this policy or our use of personal information, you may send an email to webmaster@5280.com. We
