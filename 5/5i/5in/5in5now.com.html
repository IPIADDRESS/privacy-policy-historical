				<p>5in5Now.com collects PII and/or other data from individuals when you voluntarily enter one of our websites and take an action. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features or be eligible to receive special offers. The information that you are asked to provide may include, but is not limited to, your name, postal address, email address, street address, zip code, telephone number(s), birth date, gender, salary range, education, marital status, occupation, employment status, personal and online interests as well as other information that may be requested from time to time. We may also collect information, including, but limited to, your web browser and your Internet Protocol (IP) address.</p>
				<p><strong>Information From Third Parties:</strong></p>
				<p>We may also have access to your PII and/or other data when you provide it to a third party, and we subsequently purchase, license or otherwise acquire it from such third parties. In such cases, this Privacy Policy will be applicable.</p>
				<p><strong>Other Information Provided To Us:</strong></p>
				<p>Other times that we may obtain PII and/or other data from you include (1) when you make a claim for an offer or seek to redeem an offer by us or a third party, (2) when you request assistance through our customer service department, or (3) when you voluntarily subscribe to a service or newsletter provided by us or a third party.

In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. 5in5Now.com reserves the right to retain Web Beacon data indefinitely.</p>
