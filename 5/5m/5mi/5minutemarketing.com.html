                Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name
                and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's
                "Internet Protocol" IP address. When a visitor
                requests a page from any Web site within the 5minutemarketing.com
                Network, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's
                domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address
                reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from
                which you have accessed our site. We use this information to
                examine our traffic in aggregate, but do not collect and
                evaluate this information for individuals.</font>

                and simple, clear instructions of how to remove your name from

                tracked by the request date in a Customer Relationship

                mailings after the removal request date. Remove requests can be
                communicated to our company via phone to the phone number of our
