</ul>
<p>
  Where Olderiswiser Media Limited needs to use your personal information we will obtain your consent first. Otherwise, by providing us with the information either verbally, written or using our website, you consent to the collection, use and processing of this information by Olderiswiser Media Limited. We will use every reasonable effort to safeguard your personal information. You also have the option to withhold your information by written notification to us.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h2>
  4. When will Olderiswiser Media Limited contact me?</h2>
<p>
  Olderiswiser Media Limited may contact you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>

<h2>
  5. Will I be contacted for marketing information?</h2>
<p>
  You have the option to decline to receive marketing information from us by “opting out” with written notification to us.</p>
<h2>
  6. Will Olderiswiser Media Limited share my personal information with third parties?</h2>
<p>
  We will keep your information confidential except where disclosure is required or permitted by law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies) or as described in paragraph 7 below. Generally, we will only use your information within Olderiswiser Media Limited. However, sometimes Olderiswiser Media Limited uses third parties to process your information. Olderiswiser Media Limited will require these third parties to comply strictly with its instructions.</p>
<h2>
  7. Offensive or inappropriate content on the websites of Olderiswiser Media Limited</h2>

<p>
  Where Olderiswiser Media Limited reasonably believes that you are or may be in breach of any of the laws of England or Wales (e.g. because content you have posted may be defamatory), Olderiswiser Media Limited may use your personal information to inform relevant third parties such as your employer, school e-mail/Internet provider or law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.</p>
<h2>
  8. What if I am a user aged 16 or under?</h2>
<p>
  If you are aged 16 or under, please get your parent/guardian's permission beforehand whenever you provide personal information to Olderiswiser Media Limited's website. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal information.</p>
<h2>
  9. How long will Olderiswiser Media Limited keep my personal information?</h2>
<p>
  We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant service, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with Olderiswiser Media Limited. In the case that you wish to cancel your registration as a 50connect.co.uk member, once an account is deleted a red flag goes on the database and, while people cannot use the personal information, it stays on the system for a period of one year for administration purposes before being deleted automatically.</p>
<p>
  Where you contribute to 50connect.co.uk, Olderiswiser Media Limited will generally only keep your content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted. For example, Olderiswiser Media Limited will only keep copies of entries to a photographic competition for the duration of the competition. However other areas (e.g. the Forum) are likely to have a longer, or even permanent, duration.</p>
<h2>

<p>
  Under the Data Protection Act you have the right to request a copy of the personal information Olderiswiser Media Limited holds about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected.&nbsp; We will use reasonable efforts to supply, correct or delete personal information about you on our files. You are required to provide 2 pieces of photographic identification and an administration charge may be incurred for the process.</p>
<p>

<h2>
  11. Changes to Olderiswiser Media Limited's Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time so you may wish to check it each time you submit personal information to any 50connect.co.uk website. The date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page.</p>
<h2>
  12. Cookies Policy - Information Olderiswiser Media Limited collects from you</h2>
<h3>
  a. What is a cookie?</h3>
<p>
  A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.</p>
<p>
  Cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the websites to your interests. Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of 50connect.co.uk features. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.</p>
<p>
  During the course of any visit to 50connect.co.uk, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.</p>
<br>
<h3>
  b. How does Olderiswiser Media Limited use cookies?</h3>
<p>
  Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. For example: if on a previous visit you went to our education pages, we might find this out from your cookie and highlight educational information on your second and subsequent visits.</p>
<p>
  Olderiswiser Media Limited also use a number of independent measurement and research companies. They gather information regarding the visitors to Olderiswiser Media Limited sites on our behalf using cookies, log file data and code which is embedded on our website. Olderiswiser Media Limited uses this type of information to help improve the services it provides to its users. Olderiswiser Media Limited requires that third parties to comply strictly with its instruction (see paragraph 6 above). Certain other areas of 50connect.co.uk may use cookies for a specific reason - for example, to help an online game work effectively on your device. If this is the case, the local terms for that area of the website will make this clear and you should refer to those local terms for additional information.</p>
