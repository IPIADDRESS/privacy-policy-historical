<div class="page">
<p>WWW.LA is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. The following outlines our privacy and data protection policy for this website.

Third party partners of www.la and other websites you may access via www.la have different privacy policies and are not subject to this privacy policy. CentralNic recommends that you read the privacy statement of each such website to find out how they protect your personal information. If you have any requests concerning your personal information or any queries with regard to these practices please contact our Webmaster by e-mail at <a href="mailto:support@www.la">support@www.la.</a></p>

<h3>Collection and Use of User Details</h3>
<p>When you register at www.la, we may collect personal details about you. Personal information such as your name, address, email address and job title is collected via www.la's registration forms.</p>
<p>When you visit the CentralNic site, we also collect web site usage information and information about your computer and internet connection, including your computer's IP address, the type and version of browser and operating system you use, your internet domain and, if you arrived at www.la via a link from another website, the URL of the linking page.</p>
<p>We may use this information to:
</p><ul style="line-height: 1.5; list-style: disc; margin-left: 45px;">
<li>fulfil orders</li>
<li>personalise the content you will see based on your personal characteristics or preferences</li>
<li>notify you of relevant new products and features on www.la (if you opt in to receiving such information)</li>
<li>notify you of promotions from www.la (if you opt in to receiving such information)</li>
<li>ensure, as far as is practical, that our site is compatible with the browsers and operating systems used by the majority of our visitors.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<br>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small file which is placed on the user's hard drive during a www.la visit. This file allows the user to move quickly and easily around our site. It is used to identify returning users and to identify subscribers and registrants (a registrant - and subscriber - will have the cookie linked to their e-mail address as a way of identifying them). This means that if you are a registrant or subscriber, you will not have to login each time you visit. We also use a cookie to track a user's sessions. We use this information to find out what site features are most popular so that we can develop www.la in the light of our analysis of people's usage. We also use cookies and the information we collect to show you relevant content.</p>
<p>You can delete cookies from your hard drive at any time. Bear in mind, though, that if you delete these cookies, any settings such as your stored username and password will have to be reset when you log in again.</p>
<p>Unlike many sites, you will be able to use www.la even if you set your browser not to accept any cookies. However, certain features and content may not be available to you and you will have to log in every time you visit.</p>
<p>Further information on the use of cookies can be found at <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com">www.cookiecentral.com</a></p>

<h3>Security Policy</h3>
