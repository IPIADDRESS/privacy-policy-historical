<h2>10. CONSENT TO USE OF ANTI-CHEATING SOFTWARE</h2>
<p> Our software package - used to access and use the Services - contains certain  features designed to detect use of automated programs that enable artificial  (non-human) intelligence to play on Our site. Use of such 'bot' software  programs violates Our <a href="/en/general-information/legal-matters/general-terms-and-conditions">Terms and  Conditions of Use</a>, where We deem it detrimental to other players. By installing Our  software and using the Services, You consent to Our software performing the  functions described in this section. Our software may perform any or all of the  following functions in order to detect the use of illicit automated programs  and ensure that We maintain a 'cheat free' environment for all users: (1) scan  Your list of active software applications while You are using the Services; (2)  scan Your list of active processes while You are using the Services; and (3)  scan the files in Your Services and site-related program folders to ensure that  only 'non-hacked' versions of Our software are being used. If any of the  foregoing processes reveals a suspect application or process, Our software may  scan the files associated with the suspect application or process and compile a  composite mesh (i.e., a profile that characterizes the files associated with  the application or process) to be matched against profiles for known illicit  automated programs. Our software will not perform any random search of large  portions of Your hard drive, equipment or files, and it will not transmit any  information to Us or to any third party other than the information necessary to  identify use of illicit automated programs as described above. Our software  will not alter any files or information on Your computer or other equipment and  will not interfere with the operation of any of Your applications. You may  terminate use of Our software at any time by uninstalling Our software package.</p>

<h2>14. THIRD-PARTY PRACTICES</h2>
<p> We cannot ensure the protection of any information or images that You provide  to a third-party online site that links to or from the Services or any  information collected by any third party administering Our <span class="glossary" title="If you have your own website and would like to advertise bwin on it, then you can acquire information on how it works here.">affiliate program</span>  (if applicable) or any other program, since these third-party online sites are  owned and operated independently of Us.

<h2>15. LEGAL DISCLAIMER</h2>
<p> The Services operate 'AS-IS' and 'AS-AVAILABLE,' without liability of any kind.  We are not responsible for events beyond Our direct control.

<h2>16. MERGERS AND OTHER EVENTS REQUIRING TRANSFER</h2>
<p> If We should ever file for bankruptcy, or become insolvent, or be acquired by a  third party, merge with a third party, sell all or part of Our assets, or  transfer substantially all or part of Our relevant assets to a third party, We  are entitled to share the Personal Information and all other information You  have provided through the Services to potential and subsequent business and  merger partners. By agreeing to the standard Terms and Conditions of Use, you  hereby give your consent to such transfer of this information.</p>
