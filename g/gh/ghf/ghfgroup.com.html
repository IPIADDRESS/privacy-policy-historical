    <p>This privacy policy applies to the processing activities of GHF (as defined below). As part of our day-to-day business we need to collect personal information from our customers and potential customers to ensure that we can meet their needs and provide them with information about our services. Your privacy is important to us and it is our policy to respect the confidentiality of information and the privacy of individuals.</p>

<p>This policy outlines how we manage your personal information supplied to us by you or a third party in connection with our provision of services to you or which we collect from your use of our services and/or website(s). It also details your rights in respect of our processing of your personal information. Our privacy policy will be reviewed from time to time to take account of new obligations and technology, changes to our operations and practices and to make sure it remains appropriate to the changing environment.</p>

<p>Any personal information we hold will be governed by our most current privacy notice.</p>

<h3>WHO ARE WE?</h3>

<p>The three entities within the GHF Group are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>G. H. Financials Ltd </strong>of 4th Floor, 29 Ludgate Hill, London, EC4M 7JR (registration number 02775278) and who is registered with the Information Commissioner under No. Z5369625)</li>
	<li><strong>G. H. Financials, LLC</strong>, 311 South Wacker Drive, Suite 1550 ,Chicago, IL 60606 USA</li>
	<li><strong>G. H. Financials (Hong Kong) Limited</strong>, Suite 2007, 20th Floor, The Center, 99 Queen's Road Central, Hong Kong,</li>
</ul>

<p>(together “GHF”).</p>

<p>GHF provides global clearing services in exchange traded futures and options markets and is the data controller of your personal information in relation to those services.</p>

<p>Please note that if you are a GHF employee, a contractor to GHF or a third party service provider, your personal information will be used in connection with your employment contract, your contractual relationship or in accordance with our separate policies which are available by contacting us. Any reference to ‘us’, ‘our’, ‘we’ or ‘GHF’ in this privacy notice is a reference to each group company within the GHF Group as the context requires unless otherwise stated. Similarly, any reference to ‘you’, ‘your’, ‘yours’ or ‘yourself’ in this privacy notice is a reference to any of our customers and potential customers as the context requires unless otherwise stated.</p>

<h3>WHAT KIND OF PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>

<p>If you are an actual or potential customer, we may collect the following types of information about you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>name, address and contact details</li>
	<li>date of birth and gender</li>
	<li>in certain cases, information about your income and wealth including details about your assets and liabilities, account balances, trading statements, tax and financial statements</li>
	<li>profession and employment details</li>
	<li>location data</li>
	<li>any other similar information.</li>
</ul>

<p>We obtain this information in a number of ways through your use of our services or other dealings with us including through any of the GHF websites, the customer on-boarding process, marketing sign up forms, subscribing to news updates and from information provided in the course of ongoing customer service correspondence. We may also obtain personal information about you through your use of our websites or through the use of cookies on our websites and, in particular by recording which pages you look at on our websites.</p>

<p>We may ask for other personal information voluntarily from time to time (for example, through market research or surveys). If you choose not to provide the information we need to fulfil your request for a specific product or service, we may not be able to provide you with the requested product or service. We may record any communications, electronic, by telephone, in person or otherwise, that we have with you in relation to the services we provide to you and our relationship with you. These recordings will be our sole property and will constitute evidence of the communications between us. Such telephone conversations may be recorded without the use of a warning tone or any other further notice. Further, if you visit any of our offices or premises, we may have CCTV which will record your image.</p>

<h3>WHO MAY WE DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION TO?</h3>

<p>As part of using your personal information for the purposes set out above, we may disclose your information to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>other companies within the GHF Group who provide financial and other back office services</li>
	<li>service providers and specialist advisers who have been contracted to provide us with administrative, IT, financial, regulatory, compliance, insurance, research or other services</li>
	<li>credit providers, courts, tribunals and applicable regulatory authorities as agreed or authorised by law or our agreement with you</li>
	<li>anyone authorised by you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, we require that organisations outside the GHF Group who handle or obtain personal information acknowledge the confidentiality of this information, undertake to respect any individual’s right to privacy and comply with the all relevant data protection laws and this privacy notice.</p>

<h3>HOW DO WE OBTAIN YOUR CONSENT?</h3>

<p>Where our use of your personal information requires your consent, such consent will be provided in accordance with the applicable term and conditions of use on our website(s) or any other contract we may have entered into with you or as set out in our communication with you from time to time. If we rely on your consent as our legal basis for processing your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time by contacting us using the contact details set out in this privacy notice.</p>

<h3>MANAGEMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

<p>We always take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that your information is secure. In particular, we train our employees who handle personal information to respect the confidentiality of customer information and the privacy of individuals. We regard breaches of your privacy very seriously and will impose appropriate penalties, including dismissal where necessary. Our Compliance team ensures that our management of personal information is in accordance with this privacy notice and the applicable legislation.</p>

<h3>HOW DO WE STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION AND FOR HOW LONG?</h3>

<p>Safeguarding the privacy of your information is important to us, whether you interact with us personally, by phone, by mail, over the internet or any other electronic medium. We hold personal information in a combination of secure computer storage facilities and paper-based files and other records, and take steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. When we consider that personal information is no longer needed, we will remove any details that will identify you or we will securely destroy the records. However, we may need to maintain records for a significant period of time. For example, we are subject to certain anti-money laundering laws which require us to retain:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a copy of the documents we used to comply with our customer due diligence obligations; and</li>

<h4>Erasure</h4>

<p>You can ask us to delete or remove your personal information in certain circumstances such as where we no longer need it or you withdraw your consent (where applicable) provided that we have no legal obligation to retain that data.

<h4>Processing restrictions</h4>

<p>You can ask us to ‘block’ or suppress the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances such as where you contest the accuracy of that personal information or object to us processing it. It will not stop us from storing your personal information though. We will tell you before we lift any restriction.
