  or other web sites owned or operated by grindplay (the "grindplay
  Sites") (collectively or individually "Users") value their
  privacy. This Privacy Notice details important information regarding the use
  and disclosure of User information collected on the Grindplay Sites. Grindplay
  provides this Privacy Notice to help you make an informed decision about
  whether to use or continue using the Grindplay Sites.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the <a href="http://www.grindplay.com/terms.php">Grindplay
  Terms of Use</a>. Your use of the Grindplay Sites and any personal information
  you provide on the Grindplay Sites remains subject to the terms of this
  Privacy Notice and our <a href="http://www.grindplay.com/terms.php">Terms of
  Use</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Please note that any video, image, or other content posted at the direction
  of Users onto the Grindplay Sites becomes published content and is not
  considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Notice.</font></p>
  <h2><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">The Information Grindplay Collects</font></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>User Provided Information:</strong>  <font size="2"> You provide certain
      personally identifiable information (such as your name and email address)
      to Grindplay when choosing to participate in various activities on the
      Grindplay Sites such as uploading videos, posting messages in our forums
      or in the video comments section, taking advantage of promotions,
      responding to surveys, or subscribing to newsletters or other mailing
      lists.</font><br>
      &nbsp;</font></li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Cookies Information:</strong>  <font size="2"> When you visit the Grindplay
      Sites, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a
      string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely
      identifies your browser. Grindplay uses both session cookies and
      persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your
      browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent
      visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your
      web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and
      disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to
      refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However,
      some features of the Grindplay Sites may not function properly if the
      ability to accept cookies is disabled.</font><br>
      &nbsp;</font></li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Log File Information:</strong>  <font size="2"> When you use the Grindplay Sites,
      our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser
      sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include
      information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP")
      address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs,
      platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed
      and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular
      pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may
      uniquely identify your browser.</font><br>
      &nbsp;</font></li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Clear GIFs Information:</strong>  <font size="2"> When you use the Grindplay
      Sites, we may employ "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are
      used to track the online usage patterns of our Users anonymously (i.e., in
      a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use clear
      GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are
      opened by recipients.</font></font></li>
  </ul>
  <h2><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">The Way Grindplay Uses Information</font></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the
      Grindplay Sites, then we use your personal information to operate,
      maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the
      Grindplay Sites.<br>
      &nbsp;</font></li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose
      online (on discussion boards, in messages, within your public profile
      page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by
      others. Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other
      Users when you upload videos or send messages through the Grindplay Sites
      and other Users can contact you through messages. Any videos that you
      submit to the Grindplay Sites may be redistributed through the internet
      and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.<br>
      &nbsp;</font></li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable
      information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent
      or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have
      the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address
      without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such
      as notifying you of major Grindplay Site changes or for customer service
      purposes).<br>
      &nbsp;</font></li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">We use both your personally identifiable information and certain
      non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage
      data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to
      improve the quality and design of the Grindplay Sites and to create new
      features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking,
      and analyzing User preferences and trends.<br>
      &nbsp;</font></li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember
      information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or
      the next time you visit the Grindplay Sites; (b) provide custom,
      personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our
      marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of
      visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions,
      status in promotions, and contests.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <h2><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">When Grindplay Discloses Information</font></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">We provide personally identifiable information and
      non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated
      companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing
      such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to
      process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use
      reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other
      appropriate confidentiality and security measures.<br>
      &nbsp;</font></li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name
      or email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial
      or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific
      program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or
      opt-out.<br>
      &nbsp;</font></li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous
      User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number
      of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in
      understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services,
      advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Grindplay Sites.<br>
      &nbsp;</font></li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">We may release personally identifiable information and/or
      non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in
      the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state
      and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order,
      subpoena, or search warrant.<br>
      &nbsp;</font></li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Grindplay also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable
      information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Grindplay
      believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our <a href="http://www.grindplay.com/terms.php">Terms
      of Use</a>, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend
      itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government
      enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web
      site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Grindplay,
      our Users or others.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <h2><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Your Choices About Privacy</font></h2>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information
  through the Grindplay Sites, in which case Grindplay may not be able to
  provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your personal
  profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your <a href="http://www.grindplay.com/my_profile.php">account
  profile page</a>. Please note that media files uploaded by Users to the
  Grindplay Sites cannot be removed and remain subject to our <a href="http://www.grindplay.com/terms.php">Terms
  of Use</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as
  requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you
  profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the
  secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.</font></p>
  <h2><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</font></h2>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Grindplay allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad
  networks, to serve advertisements within the Grindplay Sites. These
  third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your
  browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Grindplay Sites. They
  automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use
  other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure
  the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising
  content you see.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Grindplay does not provide any personally identifiable information to these
  third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part
  of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in
  or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Grindplay to show
  an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or
  audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels
  of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server
  may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to
  reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the
  Grindplay Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any
  personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to
  you.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad
  servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their
  practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices.
  Grindplay's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the
  activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Currently, Grindplay has relationships with the following third-party ad
  servers or ad networks:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Google, Inc.<br>
      </font>
      </strong></li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"><b>Etology, Inc.<br>
      </b>http://www.etology.co</font></li>
  </ul>
  <font color="#FFFFFF">
  <br>
  &nbsp;</font>
  <h2><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Our Commitment To Data Security</font></h2>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Grindplay uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical
  safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal
  information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any
  information you transmit to Grindplay and you do so at your own risk. Once we
  receive your transmission of information, Grindplay makes commercially
  reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note
  that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed,
  disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical,
  or managerial safeguards.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">If Grindplay learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to
  notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
  Grindplay may post a notice on the Grindplay Sites if a security breach
  occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive
  notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a
  security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice)
  you should notify us using this <a href="http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/request.py?hl=en-US">contact
  form</a>.</font></p>
  <h2><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy</font></h2>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that
  reason, Grindplay does not knowingly collect or maintain personally
  identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the
  Grindplay Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website
  is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please
  do not use or access the Grindplay Sites at any time or in any manner. If
  Grindplay learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13
  years of age has been collected on the Grindplay Sites without verified
  parental consent, then Grindplay will take the appropriate steps to delete
  this information.</font></p>
  <h2><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Special Note to International Users</font></h2>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The Grindplay Sites are hosted in the United States and are intended for
  and directed to Users in the United States. If you are a User accessing the
  Grindplay Sites from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws
  or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that
  differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued
  use of the Grindplay Sites, which are governed by U.S. law, this Privacy
  Notice, and our <a href="http://www.grindplay.com/terms.php">Terms of Use</a>,
  you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you
  consent to that transfer.</font></p>
  <h2><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</font></h2>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">In the event that Grindplay is acquired by or merged with a third party
  entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or
  assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of such
  merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event
  of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for
  the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles
  affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your
  personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</font></p>
  <h2><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice</font></h2>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">This Privacy Notice may be revised periodically and this will be reflected
  by the "effective date" below. Please revisit this page to stay
  aware of any changes. In general, we only use your personal information in the
  manner described in the Privacy Notice in effect when we received the personal
  information you provided. Your continued use of the Grindplay Sites
  constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Notice and any future revisions.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">For revisions to this Privacy Notice that may be materially less
  restrictive on our use or disclosure of the personal information you have
  already provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before
  implementing such revisions with respect to such information.</font></p>
