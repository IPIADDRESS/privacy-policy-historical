		<h2>Ogden Publications, Inc. Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Ogden Publications, Inc. (collectively referred to in this Privacy Statement as 
			"we," "us," or "Ogden Publications, Inc.") recognize the importance of 
			protecting the privacy of all information provided by users of our websites, 
			subscribers to our magazines, registrants for our events, recipients of our 
			e-mail newsletters and all of our customers. We created this policy with a 
			fundamental respect for our usersâ€™ right to privacy and to guide our 
			relationships with our users. This privacy statement discloses the privacy 
			practices for all products and services owned by Ogden Publications, Inc. A 
			current list of our publications, websites, and products can be found at <a href="http://www.ogdenpubs.com/">
				http://www.ogdenpubs.com/</a>.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</strong></h4>
		<p>Ogden Publications, Inc. collects information from our website users, magazine 
			subscribers and customers. In this section of our privacy policy, we will 
			describe the type of information we collect and how we use it to provide better 
			services to our customers.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong>Registration and Ordering</strong></h4>
		<p>When using some of our websites and signing up for certain selected services 
			(such as ordering products), users must first register. During registration, 
			users are required to give their contact information (such as name, e-mail 
			address, mailing address and Zip code). We also may wish to collect demographic 
			information (such as hobbies, purchasing habits, and areas of interest). For 
			internal purposes, we use this information to communicate with users and 
			provide requested services, and, for our website visitors, to provide a more 
			personalized experience on our sites. We use aggregate demographic information 
			about our audience to improve our service, for marketing purposes and/or 
			industry reporting purposes.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Many of our products and services are free to subscribers who meet certain 
			demographic criteria. Examples include product discounts and promotion codes. 
			Independent auditors may need to certify the eligibility of these subscribers. 
			In order to do that, we may collect unique identifiers (such as motherâ€™s maiden 
			name) that we disclose to the auditors strictly for industry reporting and 
			audit verification purposes.</p>
		<br>
		<p>For our services that require payment (such as certain events, products and 
			subscriptions), we also collect credit card information (such as account name, 
			number, expiration date, and verification code), which is used for billing 
			purposes only, and is not otherwise shared.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong>E-mail Newsletters</strong></h4>
		<p>If users wish to subscribe to our e-mail newsletters, we ask for contact 
			information (such as name, e-mail address and, occasionally, demographic 
			information). We use this information in the same manner as we use contact 
			information in the registration and ordering process described above. 
			Recipients of our newsletters can unsubscribe using the instructions listed at 
			the end of the e-mail newsletter.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong>Surveys and Contests</strong></h4>
		<p>From time to time we invite users to provide information via surveys or 
			contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary 
			and the user therefore has a choice whether to disclose requested contact 
			information (such as name and mailing address) and demographic information 
			(such as Zip code or hobby). In addition to other uses set forth in this 
			policy, contact information collected in connection with surveys and contests 
			is used to notify the winners and award prizes, and to monitor or improve the 
			use and satisfaction of the site.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong>Interactive Features</strong></h4>
		<p>At some of our sites, we offer interactive and community features such as 
			discussion boards. Note that all personal information sent or posted via such 
			features becomes public information for which we are not responsible.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong>E-mail This Article</strong></h4>
		<p>If users elect to use our referral service for informing a friend about our 
			articles, sites and services, we may ask them for the friend's name and e-mail 
			address. Ogden Publications, Inc. will store and use this information to send 
			the friend an invitation. This information may also be used to provide 
			information about our company and related products and services. The friend may 
			contact us as specified in the subsequent message to request that no further 
			communications be sent.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong>Communications with Us</strong></h4>
		<p>We have features where users can submit information to us (such as our 
			comment/feedback forms). Letters to the editor and similar submissions may be 
			made public. Requests for service, support or information may be forwarded as 
			needed to best respond to a specific request. We may retain e-mails and other 
			information sent to us for our internal administrative purposes, and to help us 
			to serve customers better.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong>Communications from Us: Service Updates, Special Offers</strong></h4>
		<p>In order to best serve our customers, we may send updates that contain important 
			information about our sites and services. For example, we may send new members 
			a welcome message, confirmations on purchases or verification of password and 
			username for our password-protected sites. We may also communicate with a user 
			to provide requested services and for account-related issues via e-mail, phone 
			or regular mail.</p>
		<br>
		<p>We offer our users the option to receive information about our company and 
			related products, services and special deals. Users can choose not to receive 
			these communications, as set forth in our Permission section below.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong>Automatic Data Collection</strong></h4>
		<p>Our websites have features that automatically collect information from users, to 
			deliver content specific to users' interests and to honor their preferences. 
			This information assists us in creating sites that will serve the needs of our 
			users.</p>
		<br>
		<p>We use "cookies," a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing 
			information about the user. Cookies benefit the user by requiring login only 
			once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookies, they 
			may be limited in the use of some areas of our site. For example, the user may 
			not be able to participate in sweepstakes, contests or drawings. Additionally, 
			we may note some of the pages the user visits on our site through the use of 
			pixel tags (also called clear gifs). The use of cookies and pixels enable us to 
			track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our 
			sites.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Some of our business affiliates use cookies on our sites in ads or promotions. 
			However, we have no access to or control over these business affiliates' 
			cookies; we urge users to read their privacy policies for information.</p>
		<br>
		<p>For our internal purposes, we gather date, time, browser type, navigation 
			history and IP address of all visitors to our site. This information does not 
			contain anything that can identify users personally. We use this information 
			for our internal security audit log, trend analysis and system administration, 
			and to gather broad demographic information about our user base for aggregate 
			use.</p>
		<br>
		<p>We may combine demographic information supplied by a subscriber at registration 
			with site usage data to provide general profiles, in an aggregate 
			non-personally identifiable form, about our users and their preferences in the 
			content of the site and advertising. We may share this composite information 
			with our advertisers and business affiliates to help them better understand our 
			services.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4><strong>WITH WHOM YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED</strong></h4>
		<p>When we have co-branded, customized, private label, powered by or sponsored 
			products and services, or when we join with other parties to provide specific 
			services, we may share (provide and receive) personal information with them. We 
			do not share credit card information with such third parties.</p>
		<br>
		<p>On occasion, we may provide targeted lists of names and offline and online 
			contact information for marketing purposes to third parties, subject to our 
			Permission policies. We give users the option of not having their name or 
			contact information disclosed to third parties, as set forth in the Permission 
			section.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Other than as set forth above, we do not share personally identifiable 
			information with other companies, apart from those acting as our agents in 
			providing our product(s)/service(s), and which agree to use it only for that 
			purpose and to keep the information secure and confidential. Also, our parent, 
			subsidiary and affiliate companies, entities into which our company may be 
			merged, or entities to which any of our assets, products, sites or operations 
			may be transferred, will be able to use personal information. We will also 
			disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in 
			response to a court order or a subpoena or other legal obligation, in response 
			to a law enforcement agency's request, or in special cases when we have reason 
			to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact 
			or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or 
			interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or 
			property. Users should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. 
			Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances to 
			permit personal information to be shared or transferred to third parties 
			without permission.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>We may share aggregate information, which is not personally identifiable, with 
			others. This information may include usage and demographic data, but it will 
			not include personal information.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong>CORRECTING/UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h4>
		<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as Zip code), or 
			if a user no longer desires our product(s)/service(s), we provide a way to 
			correct or update that user's personal data. The user should contact Ogdenâ€™s
			<a id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_lnkCustomerCare" href="https://www.grit.com/shopping/help/contact-by-email.aspx">Customer Care Department</a>&nbsp;for 
			the applicable product or service.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong>PERMISSION</strong></h4>
		<p>Our users are given the opportunity to choose whether to receive information not 
			directly related to the registered services from our affiliates and us. Users 
			also have the opportunity to choose whether to have personal information shared 
			with third parties for marketing purposes. Instructions for how to exercise 
			this choice are contained in e-mails sent by us, on our websites and in each of 
			our publications. Please note that we will endeavor to implement requests 
			within a reasonable time, although for a time users may continue to receive 
			mailings, etc., transmitted based on information released prior to the 
			implementation of the request. Users will continue to receive information 
			directly related to their registered services, so they always are kept 
			informed.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong>SECURITY</strong></h4>
		<p>We use reasonable precautions to protect our users' personal information and to 
			store it securely. Sensitive information that is transmitted to us online (such 
			as a credit card number) is 128-bit encrypted and is transmitted to us 
			securely. In addition, access to all of our users' information, not just the 
			sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted. Only employees who need 
			the information (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service 
			representative) to perform a specific job are granted access to personally 
			identifiable information. Finally, the servers on which we store personally 
			identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong>PURCHASING RESTRICTIONS</strong></h4>
		<p>Ogden Publications, Inc. does not sell products for purchase by children. If you 
			are under 18, you may use our website only with the involvement of a parent or 
			guardian.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong><span id="safeShop">SAFE SHOPPING GUARANTEE</span></strong></h4>
		<p>Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, a credit card issuer cannot make you liable 
			for charges in excess of $50.00 that result from the unauthorized use of your 
			credit card. There are similar federal laws that relate to debit cards. 
			Exceptions do apply, and you will have to comply with rules of your credit card 
			or debit card issuer, so please contact your card issuer for further details.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>If through no fault of your own, a credit card or debit card issuer assesses you 
			a fee because of the unauthorized use of your credit card or debit card on our 
			site, Ogden Publications, Inc. will reimburse you for such amount up to $50.00. 
			Please contact our
			<a id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_lnkCustomerCare2" href="https://www.grit.com/shopping/help/contact-by-email.aspx">Customer Care Department</a>&nbsp;for 
			details.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong>LINKS</strong></h4>
		<p>Our websites contain links to other sites. Ogden Publications, Inc. is not 
			responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites. We 
			encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the 
			privacy statements of each website to which we may link that may collect 
			personally identifiable information.</p>
		<br>
