Persistent Cookies we place can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas or features of the Grindr Service may not work properly.<br>

<b>4. Use of Your Data</b><br>
<b>4.1 General Use of Your Data.</b> We use your Personal Data in the following ways and as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy: (a) to identify you as a user on the Grindr Service; (b) to improve the Grindr Service; (c) to provide the services you request, including the Grindr Service; (d) to respond to your inquiries related to support, employment opportunities or other requests; (e) to send you Promotional Emails (defined below) if you voluntarily provided us your email address to be included on our mailing lists; (f) to fulfill a product or service purchase; and (g) to conduct a Partner Promotion that you voluntarily entered into as described below.<br>

<b>5. Disclosure Of Your Personal Data.</b> We disclose Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below (and elsewhere in this Privacy Policy).<br>
<b>5.1 IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PROFILE INFORMATION. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU USE THE GRINDR APP, AS A DEFAULT, YOUR PROFILE INFORMATION (DEFINED ABOVE) IS PUBLIC AND OTHER USERS OF THE GRINDR APP CAN SEE YOUR PROFILE INFORMATION.

Your Profile Information will be used for these searches. The Grindr App user interface may include a feature to make certain items of Profile Information non-public, in which case we will respect your selection. However, even if you choose to make non-public certain items of your Profile Information if and as permitted by the user interface, sophisticated users who use the Grindr App in an unauthorized manner may nevertheless be able to obtain this information. The Grindr App may include a feature that allows you to designate certain users as “Favorites” or “Blocked”. Generally, this designation is only viewable by you; however, sophisticated users who use the Grindr App in an unauthorized manner may be able to determine which users you have designated as Favorites or Blocked. <b>YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO THE DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PROFILE INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.</b><br>
<b>5.2 IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT DISTANCE INFORMATION. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU USE THE GRINDR APP, AS A DEFAULT, YOUR DISTANCE INFORMATION IS PUBLIC AND OTHER USERS OF THE GRINDR APP CAN SEE YOUR DISTANCE INFORMATION WITHIN YOUR PROFILE.</b> Grindr App users can use the search feature in the Grindr App to search for other users by distance. Your Distance Information will be used for these searches. Your Distance Information is public, but the Grindr App may include a feature to hide or change the accuracy of your Distance Information, in which case we will respect your selection. However, even if you choose to hide the display of your Distance Information, sophisticated users who use the Grindr App in an unauthorized manner may nevertheless be able to determine your location. <b>YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO THE DISCLOSURE OF YOUR DISTANCE INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.</b><br>
<b>5.3 Third Parties.</b> We share your Device ID and demographic information with our advertising display and analytic partners. These third parties may also collect information directly from you as described in Section 3.2(d). Their privacy policy applies to their collection, use and disclosure of your information that we provide them and that they collect directly. Without limiting the foregoing, one of our many partners is Google Analytics. Google Analytics collects information anonymously and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors. Google Analytics uses its own cookie to track visitor interactions. Website owners can view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with their website so they can improve their website and how people find it. Google’s privacy policy applies to their collection, use and disclosure of your information. Please review the following links to better understand their practices: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank" class="highlight">http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html" target="_blank" class="highlight">http://www.google.com/privacy.html</a>, and <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html" target="_blank" class="highlight">http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html</a>.<br>
<b>5.4 Third Party Service Providers.</b> We may share your Personal Data with third party service providers to: provide you with the Grindr Services; to conduct quality assurance testing; to provide technical support; and/or to provide other services to Grindr.&nbsp; Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, these third party service providers are required by contract not to use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by Grindr.<br>

<b>5.6 Affiliates and Acquisitions.</b> We may share some or all of your Personal Data with our parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “Affiliates”) in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires our company, business, or our assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
<b>5.7 Other Disclosures.</b> Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as described below), Grindr may disclose Personal Data in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process, or to comply with relevant laws; to establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, violation of our policies, or as otherwise required by law.<br>
<b>6. Partner Promotions.</b> We may offer contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions with our third party partners from time to time (“<b>Partner Promotion</b>”). If additional or different privacy practices govern a Partner Promotion, then we will present you the additional or different terms prior to your entering the Partner Promotion, and such terms will apply to how we collect, use and disclose the information you provide through the Partner Promotion.<br>
<b>7. Third Party Websites.</b> When you click on a link to any other website or location, you will leave the Grindr Site and go to another site and another entity may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you.

<b>8.1 Our Promotional Emails.</b> We may periodically send you free newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials related to Grindr and/or the Grindr Service (“<b>Promotional Emails</b>”) if you voluntarily provided us your email address to be included on our mailing lists. When you receive Promotional Emails from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further Promotional Emails from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive. Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you service related communication, including notices of any updates to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy.<br>
<b>8.2 Apple.</b> If you are using the Grindr App on an Apple iOS4 device, Apple Inc.’s iAd network states that users may opt out of behavioral targeting by visiting <a href="http://oo.apple.com" target="_blank" class="highlight">http://oo.apple.com</a> from your iOS4 device.<br>
<b>8.3 Changes to your Personal Data.</b> You may change certain fields of your Profile Information by editing your profile in the Grindr App. You may request deletion of your Personal Data by us, but please note that we may be legally required to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives. We may keep your Device ID, hashed Device ID, and your usage history (which includes a history of text or photos that have been censored, bans, as well as a history of profile photos uploaded) for administrative purposes.<br>
<b>9. Security Of Your Personal Data.</b> Grindr is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
