In some cases, we will associate this information with your user ID number for our internal use.</p>
		<p>You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. To learn more about and manage flash cookies you can visit adobe.com and make changes at the privacy settings panel. If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of playing our Service, as FileTrek cookies are necessary to track and enhance your Service.</p>

		<p><strong>The Application and Metadata</strong></p>
		<p>We provide you with software to facilitate the monitoring, collection, recording and transmission of your data and to the Service (the “Application”).

For a complete list of the all Metadata currently being captures and stored by us, please see the Metadata Captured portion of our site. We use the Metadata collected solely in connection with our operation of the Service.</p>
		<p>Once the Application has been installed on your computer or device, it shall continue to monitor, record, collect and transmit Metadata until you uninstall the Application or otherwise render it inoperable. This can be accomplished by either logging out of the Application or uninstalling it on your computer or device.</p>

		<h2>VIII. Privacy Policies of Linked Sites and Advertisers</h2>

		<h2>IX. Security of Your Information</h2>
		<p>FileTrek implements reasonable security measures to protect the security of your information both online and offline, and we are committed to the protection of customer information.</p>
		<p>For user accounts registered directly with FileTrek profile information is protected by the password each member uses to access their online account. It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and that you immediately notify Us of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to your FileTrek account, our Website allows you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password. When you sign into your account or enter payment information (such as a credit card number when purchasing virtual currency), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology ("SSL").</p>
		<p>While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our Website and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use. If you have questions about the security of our Website, please contact us at privacy@filetrek.com.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure. Although we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we have procedures and security features in place to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
