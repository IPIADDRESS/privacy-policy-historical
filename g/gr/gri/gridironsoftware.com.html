services that you request, and this privacy statement explains data
collection and use in those situations. This privacy statement only
applies to www.gridironsoftware.com; it does not apply to other online

collected by the GridIron Website often is limited to e-mail address,
language, country or location, but may include other information when

<p>For example: If you choose a service or transaction
that requires payment, we will request personal information necessary
