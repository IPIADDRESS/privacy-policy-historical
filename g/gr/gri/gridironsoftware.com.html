	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
	
	<p align="center">GRIDIRON SOFTWARE WEBSITE PRIVACY STATEMENT<br>
	<i>This document was last updated 2009</i></p>
	
	<p>GridIron is committed to protecting your privacy.
	You can visit most pages on our site without giving us any information
	about yourself. But sometimes we do need information to provide
	services that you request, and this privacy statement explains data
	collection and use in those situations. This privacy statement only
	applies to www.gridironsoftware.com; it does not apply to other online
	or offline GridIron sites, products or services. Please read the
	complete GridIron Website privacy statement. </p>
	
	<h3>COLLECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
	
	<p>We will ask you when we need information that
	personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to
	contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are
	registering before ordering e-mail documentation, joining a
	limited-access site, signing up for an event or training, or when
	purchasing and/or registering GridIron products. Personal information
	collected by the GridIron Website often is limited to e-mail address,
	language, country or location, but may include other information when
	needed to provide a service you requested. </p>
	
	<p>For example: If you choose a service or transaction
	that requires payment, we will request personal information necessary
	for billing and/or shipping, such as: name, address, email address,
	telephone number, and credit card number. </p>
	
	<p>When you buy and install a new product, we may ask
	you to register your purchase electronically. We keep this registration
	information on file with any information you've already given us on
	previous visits to our Web site. </p>
	
	<h3>USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
	
	
	<p>We use your personal information for the following purposes:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>To deliver services that you request or purchase</li>
	<li>To help us create and publish content most relevant to you</li>
	<li>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from GridIron, if you request</li>
	<li>To allow you to access to limited-entry areas of our site as appropriate</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide
	limited services on our behalf. We will only provide those companies
	the information they need to deliver the service, and they are
	prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
	
	<p>GridIron may disclose your personal information if
	required to do so by law or to protect and defend the rights or
	property of GridIron. GridIron will not disclose your personal
	information to any third party except as specified above.</p>
