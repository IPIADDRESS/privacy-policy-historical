<p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Last Updated May 25, 2018)</strong></p>
<p>Grin, Inc. (https://www.grin.co and https://app.grin.co), as well as any present or future affiliated or related application, website or company (collectively "Grin" or "we"), recognizes the importance of your privacy. This privacy policy tells you what personal information we collect and how we use it. Grin may change this privacy policy from time to time, in its sole discretion, as discussed in section 7 below<g class="gr_ gr_220 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style replaceWithoutSep" id="220" data-gr-id="220">.By</g> using or visiting any Grin website, application, product, software, tool, data feed, and/or service (collectively the "Service"), you understand and agree to the terms of this policy.</p>
<p><strong>1. What Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>
<p>a. <em>Personally-Identifiable Information</em>: We may collect personally identifiable information when you specifically and knowingly provide it to us, for example when you request support, or register and provide personal information such as your e-mail address, name, phone number, year of birth, or other information. Where applicable, <g class="gr_ gr_191 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="191" data-gr-id="191">personally</g> identifiable information includes "personal data" as defined in applicable law.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services, applications, online resources to which this Site may link or otherwise reference (collectively "Third Party Services" or "TPS") that you may access through the Services<g class="gr_ gr_208 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style replaceWithoutSep" id="208" data-gr-id="208">.For</g> example, the Services utilize the YouTube API Services as a TPS, and you are agreeing to be bound by the YouTube Terms of Service (https://www.youtube.com/t/terms), Privacy Policy (http://www.google.com/policies/privacy), and API Services Terms of Service (https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service) when engaging YouTube content and services through the Service. We take no responsibility for the content or privacy practices of any TPS<g class="gr_ gr_217 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style replaceWithoutSep" id="217" data-gr-id="217">.We</g> encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any TPS you access.</p>
<p>You may have the option to register using a TPS or connect your account to a TPS such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or YouTube. By authorizing us to access your TPS account, you understand that we may obtain certain information from your TPS account, you authorize us to obtain certain information from your TPS account, which may include your name, email address, birthday, work history, education history, current city, shared media, and the names, profile pictures, relationship status, and current cities of your TPS contacts. We only obtain information from your TPS account that you specifically authorize and grant us permission to obtain.</p>
<p>Grin does not consider personally identifiable information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual. We collect and use your personally-identifiable information to: provide the Services; operate and improve our Service; provide customer service; perform research and analysis aimed at improving our products, Service and technology; and display content that is customized to your interests and preferences.</p>
<p>You may always choose not to provide personally identifiable information, but if you so choose, certain parts of the Service may not be available to you.If you have registered an account with us, you will have agreed to provide your personally identifiable information in order to access the Services. This consent provides us with the legal basis we require under applicable law to process your data. You maintain the right to withdraw such consent at any time. If you do not agree to our use of your personal data in line with this Policy, please do not use our Services.</p>
<p>b.<em>Sensitive Personal Data</em>:Subject to the following paragraph, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal data (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Services or otherwise to us.</p>
<p>If you send or disclose any sensitive personal data to us when you submit content to the Services, you consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data in accordance with this Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data, you must not submit such content to us.</p>
<p>c. <em>Non-Personally-Identifiable Information</em>:We may collect and aggregate non-personally identifiable information which is information which does not permit you to be identified or identifiable either by itself or in combination with other information available to a third party.This information may include information, such as a website that referred you to us, your IP address, browser type and language, hardware types, geographic location, and access times and durations. We also may collect navigational information, including information about the Service content or pages you view, the links you click, and other actions taken in connection with the Service.</p>
<p>d. <em>Cookies, Pixels and Local Storage</em>: We may collect information using "cookies", which are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience when using the Services.</p>
<p>We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) <g class="gr_ gr_175 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="175" data-gr-id="175">first party</g> cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits any site or application that is party of the Services; and (2) <g class="gr_ gr_177 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="177" data-gr-id="177">third party</g> cookies, which are served by service providers on sites or applications and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.</p>
<p><u>Cookies we use</u></p>
<p>The Services use the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:</p>

<p><em>Essential Cookies </em></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through the Services and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of the sites or applications and help the content of the pages you request load quickly<g class="gr_ gr_182 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style replaceWithoutSep" id="182" data-gr-id="182">.Without</g> these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><em>Functionality Cookies</em></p>
</td>

<p>These cookies allow the Services to remember choices you make when you use a site or application, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details and remembering the changes you make to other parts of your <g class="gr_ gr_186 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="186" data-gr-id="186">account,</g> or preferences<g class="gr_ gr_190 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style replaceWithoutSep" id="190" data-gr-id="190">.The</g> purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you use the Services.</p>
</td>

<p><em>Analytics and Performance Cookies</em></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to the Services and how users use the Services. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. The information is aggregated and anonymous. It includes the number of visitors to, the websites that referred them, the pages visited, what time of day they visited<g class="gr_ gr_183 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style replaceWithoutSep" id="183" data-gr-id="183">,whether</g> they have visited before, and other similar information<g class="gr_ gr_187 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style replaceWithoutSep" id="187" data-gr-id="187">.We</g> use this information to help operate the Services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Services.</p>
<p>We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. It is only used to improve how the Services work. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here:<a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies">https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies</a></p>

<p><u>Disabling cookies</u></p>
<p>You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the "settings," "help" "tools" or "edit" facility).Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings.If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you use the Services</p>
<p>Pixel Tags</p>
<p>We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on the Services to track the actions of users on our sites and applications. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services, so that we can manage our content more effectively. The information we collect using pixel tags is not linked to our users personal data.</p>
<p>Do Not Track Signals</p>
<p>Some Internet browsers may be configured to send "Do Not Track" signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do respond to do not track signals. To find out more about "Do Not Track," please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com">http://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. What Do We Do With The Information That We Collect?</strong></p>
<p>Except as disclosed in this privacy policy, Grin does not share your personal information with any outside parties.</p>
<p>a. Grin will use the personally identifiable information directly provided by you solely for the purpose for which you have provided it, which may include:</p>
<ul>

We use standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption that encodes information for such transmissions. All Service information is maintained on secure servers. Access to stored data is protected by multi-layered security controls including firewalls, role-based access controls and passwords.
