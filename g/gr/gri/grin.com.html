Temporary cookies, or "session cookies" or "transient cookies", are cookies that are deleted after a user leaves an online service and closes his browser. In such a cookie, e.g. the contents of a shopping cart are stored in an online store or a login jam. The term "permanent" or "persistent" refers to cookies that remain stored even after the browser has been closed. Thus, e.g. the login status will be saved if users visit it after several days. Likewise, in such a cookie the interests of the users can be stored, which are used for range measurement or marketing purposes. A "third-party cookie" refers to cookies that are offered by providers other than the person who manages the online offer (otherwise, if it is only their cookies, this is called "first-party cookies").</p>

<br>

<p>We can use temporary and permanent cookies and clarify this in the context of this privacy policy.</p>

<br>

First and foremost, they should allow you to use our website more efficiently and activate certain functions on the website.</p>

<p>This information is used to improve the technical performance of services based on their specifications or audience and their reading habits, based on their locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times. Statistical surveys also include determining if the newsletters will be opened, when they will be opened and which links will be clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our goal nor, if used, that of the shipping service provider to observe individual users. The evaluations rather serve us to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.</p>

<h3>Google Re / marketing services</h3>

<p>On the basis of our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. GDPR) we use the marketing and remarketing services ("Google Marketing Services "), LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, ("Google").</p>

<br>

<p>Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active</a>).</p>

<br>

<p>Google Marketing Services allows us to better target advertisements for and on our website so that we only present ads to users that potentially match their interests. If a user e.g. is being shown ads for products he's been interested in on other websites, this is called remarketing. For these purposes, when Google and our other websites accessing Google Marketing Services are directly accessed by Google, a code will be executed by Google and so-called (re) marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also called "Web Beacons ") are being incorporated into the website. With their help, the user is provided with an individual cookie, ie. a small file is saved (instead of cookies, comparable technologies can also be used). The cookies can be set by different domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com, googlesyndication.com or googleadservices.com. In this file is noted which web pages the user visited, in what content he is interested and what offers he has clicked, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring web pages, visiting time and other information on the use of the online offer. The IP address of the users is also recorded, whereby in the context of Google Analytics we announce that the IP address is shortened within member states of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area and is only in exceptional cases being transmitted to one Google server in the US and shortened there. The IP address will not be merged with data of the user within other offers from Google. The above information may also be linked by Google with such information from other sources. If the user then visits other websites, ads tailored to him can be displayed according to his interests.</p>

<br>

<p>The data of the users are pseudonymously processed in the context of the Google marketing services. Ie. Google stores and processes e.g. not the name or e-mail address of the users, but processes the relevant data cookie-related within pseudonymous user profiles. Ie. from the perspective of Google, the ads are not managed and displayed to a specifically identified person, but to the cookie owner, regardless of who that cookie owner is. This does not apply if a user has explicitly allowed Google to process the data without this pseudonymization. The information collected about users through Google Marketing Services is transmitted to Google and stored on Google's servers in the United States.</p>

<br>

<p>Among the Google marketing services we use is amongst others the online advertising program "Google AdWords". In the case of Google AdWords, each advertiser receives a different "conversion cookie". Cookies cannot be tracked through AdWords advertisers' websites. The information collected through the cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Advertisers will see the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, they do not receive information that personally identifies users.</p>

<br>

<p>We can incorporate third-party ads based on the Google AdSense marketing service. AdSense uses cookies that enable Google and its affiliate sites to serve ads based on users' visits to this site or other sites on the Internet.</p>

<br>

<p>In addition, we may use the "Google Tag Manager" to integrate and manage the Google Analytics and Marketing Services on our website.</p>

<br>

<h3>Facebook-Pixels, Custom Audiences and Facebook Conversion</h3>

<p>Within our online offer the so-called "Facebook pixel". of the social network Facebook, by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025 , USA, or, if you are located in the EU, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbor, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook"). is used due to our legitimate interests in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer and for these purposes</p>

<br>

<p>Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&amp;status=Active" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&amp;status=Active</a>).</p>

<br>

<p>With the help of the Facebook pixel, it is on the one hand possible for Facebook to determine the visitors to our online offer as a target group for the display of advertisements (so-called "Facebook ads"). Accordingly, we use the Facebook Pixel to display the Facebook Ads we operate only to those Facebook users who have shown an interest in our online offer or who show certain features (eg interests in certain topics or products which are determined) Web pages determined on the basis of visited websites), which we transmit to Facebook (so-called "Custom Audiences"). With the help of the Facebook pixel, we also want to make sure that our Facebook ads are in line with the potential interest of users and are not annoying. With the help of the Facebook pixel we can also understand the effectiveness of the Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes, in which we see whether users were redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad (so-called "conversion").</p>

<br>

<p>The processing of the data by Facebook is part of Facebook's data usage policy. Accordingly, general notes on how to display Facebook Ads, in Facebook's Data Usage Policy: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>. For specific information and details about the Facebook Pixel and how it works, visit the help section of Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/651294705016616" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/business/help/651294705016616</a>.</p>

<br>

<p>You may object to the capture by the Facebook Pixel and use of your data to display Facebook Ads. To set which types of ads you see within Facebook, you can go to the page set up by Facebook and follow the instructions for the usage-based advertising settings: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads</a>. The settings are platform independent, ie. they are adopted for all devices, such as desktop computers or mobile devices.</p>

<h3>Integration of services and contents of third parties</h3>

<p>Based on our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. GDPR), we make use of content or services offered by third-party providers in order to provide their content and services, such as Include videos or fonts (collectively referred to as "content").</p>

<br>

<p>This always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content perceive the IP address of the users, since they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of this content. We endeavor to use only content whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content. Third parties may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also referred to as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may include, but is not limited to, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring web pages, visit time, and other information regarding the use of our online offer.</p>

<br><br>

<h3>Youtube</h3>

<p>We embed the videos on the YouTube platform of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>, Opt-Out: <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated</a>.</p>

<br>

<p>We use the so-called "extended privacy mode" of the provider Youtube to embed videos. At the same time, a cookie is only saved on your computer when the video is played. According to Youtube, however, no personal cookie information is stored for playing embedded videos with enhanced privacy. For more information about YouTube's official privacy policy, please visit: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/privacy_at_youtube" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/t/privacy_at_youtube</a></p>

<br>

<p>If you want to be sure that no data is being saved on Youtube, do not click on the embedded videos.</p>

<br><br>

<h3>Google Fonts</h3>

<p>We incorporate the fonts ("Google Fonts") provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>, Opt-Out: <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated</a>.</p>

<br><br>

<h3>Google Maps</h3>

<p>We include maps from the Google Maps service provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. The processed data may include, in particular, users' IP addresses and location data, but these are not collected without their consent (usually as part of the settings of their mobile devices).

<br><br>

<h3>Use of Facebook social plugins</h3>

<p>Based on our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) f. GDPR) we use social plugins ("plugins") of the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbor, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook"). The plugins can represent interaction elements or content (eg videos, graphics or text contributions) and can be recognized by one of the Facebook logos (white "f" on blue tile, the terms "Like", "Like" or a "thumbs up" sign ) or are marked with the addition "Facebook Social Plugin". The list and appearance of Facebook Social Plugins can be viewed here: <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/</a>.</p>

<br>

<p>Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&amp;status=Active" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&amp;status=Active</a>.</p>

<br>

<p>When a user invokes a feature of this online offering that includes such a plugin, their device establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted by Facebook directly to the device of the user and incorporated by him into the online offer. In the process, user profiles can be created from the processed data. We therefore have no influence on the amount of data that Facebook collects with the help of this plugin and therefore informs the users according to our knowledge.</p>

<br>

<p>By integrating the plugins, Facebook receives the information that a user has accessed the corresponding page of the online offer. If the user is logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to his Facebook account. If users interact with the plugins, for example press the Like button or leave a comment, the information is transmitted from your device directly to Facebook and stored there. If a user is not a member of Facebook, there is still the possibility that Facebook will find out and save their IP address. According to Facebook, only an anonymous IP address is stored in Germany.</p>

<br>

<p>The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as the related rights and setting options for protecting the privacy of users, can be found in Facebook's privacy policy: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a> .</p>

<br>

<p>If a user is a Facebook member and does not want Facebook to collect data about him via this online offer and link it to his member data stored on Facebook, he must log out of Facebook and delete his cookies before using our online offer. Other settings and inconsistencies regarding the use of data for advertising purposes are possible within the Facebook profile settings: 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads</a> 
or via the US-American site

or the EU page
<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a>. 
The settings are platform independent, ie. they are adopted for all devices, such as desktop computers or mobile devices.</p>

<br><br>

<h3>Twitter</h3>

<p>Within our online offer, features and content of the Twitter service offered by Twitter Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA, may be incorporated. For this, e.g. content such as images, videos, or text and buttons that users use to promote their content, subscribe to content creators, or subscribe to our posts. If the users are members of the platform Twitter, Twitter can call the above-mentioned assign contents and functions to the profiles of the users there.
