<p><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong><br>
<span id="calOppa"></span></p>
<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>

</div>
<div class="innerText"><strong>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</strong></div>
<div class="innerText">Users can visit our site anonymously</div>
<div class="innerText">Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</div>
<div class="innerText">Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’, and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</div>
<div class="innerText">Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:</div>

<p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong><br>
<span id="coppAct"></span></p>
<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.</p>
<div class="innerText">We do not specifically market to children under 13.</div>
<p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong><br>
<span id="ftcFip"></span></p>
<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
<div class="innerText"><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></div>
<div class="innerText">We will notify the users via email</div>
<div class="innerText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Within 1 business day</div>
<div class="innerText">We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</div>
<p><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong><br>
<span id="canSpam"></span></p>
<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

This is my list of the best prepper- and survival-related websites that frequent and recommend to others.

It's not gonna be just a bunch of crap listed in order to get a link exchanged, so the list is gonna be short for a while. I've included a quick description for each prepper blog, forum or resourse along with the links. Below that is a sampling of some of the excellent writing you can get from a quality prepper site.

I may have chosen them because they have the best survivalist articles, prepping supplies, advice for new preppers or just good information on how to be a prepper. I've left the comments open below so feel free to comment on any sites here or suggest others. Please don't use my comments section as a venue for self-promotion. only the best and most useful prepping sites are on this list.

Introduction
Catch a glimpse of what it's like walking across America with the first video compilation of my adventure!

My name is Edward Mjelde, I am a 24 year old recent college graduate from sunny San Diego, California.
This is my story about how I gave away and sold nearly all my possessions and left home with a backpack to walk coast-to-coast across the country following the 5,100 mile American Discovery Trail in pursuit of beauty, truth, and a life of risk and adventure.

This is what this category is all about - Prepping gear; how it's made, how it works, and how good it is.">Survival/Prepping Supplies and Gear</a>
