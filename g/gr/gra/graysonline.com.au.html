		  By registering for online auctions with GraysOnline, you consent to 
		  the use and disclosure of your personal information as described in 
		  this privacy statement. 
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  <b><a name="1"></a>1. Why do I need to 
		  supply personal information to participate in online auction? </b>
		  <br>
		  GraysOnline requires your personal information in order that we can 
		  process your online bids including processing payment of amounts to us if you are the Winning Bidder. 
		  You can also register with us to tell us auctions 
		  you are interested in. Naturally, you must be a registered customer 
		  prior to placing any online bids for an auction with GraysOnline. You 
		  can view all online auctions at any time, but you will need to register 
		  before you can bid at an online auction. We also require personal information 
		  to improve the service we provide to you, such as by giving you details 
		  of auctions you might be interested in.
		  <br>
		  <br>
          <b><a name="2"></a>2. When is personal information collected? </b><br>
          There are three areas on the site where you may enter and submit personal 
          information. The first area is the Online Auction Registration Form 
          that will need to be completed prior to placing an online bid at an 
          auction. The second area is your Profile where you can modify or update 
          some of your personal information such as the delivery address for your 
          purchases or your telephone contact number. The third area is Graymail 
          where you provide your details of auctions in which you may be interested.<br>
          <br>
          We will also collect information when you submit an online bid at an 
          online auction (such as what you are bidding for and how much you bid). 
          In addition, the GraysOnline server automatically collects certain information 
          about your use of our service. The information collected in each case 
          is described under section 4 below.
		  <br>
		  <br>
          <b><a name="3"></a>3. Are my personal details safe when being transmitted to you?</b><br>
           All transmission of personal information 
          is protected using SSL encrypted transmission between your Web browser 
          and our Web server. You will know when transmitted data is safe by a 
          security notice when you enter a secure page, and by the presence of 
          an icon on your browser, either a key for Netscape or a lock for Microsoft 
          Internet Explorer. The pages where you submit your account information, 
          place a bid, and receive confirmation of a successful bid are all covered 
          by our strong security measures. Additionally, secure web pages can 
          be identified by the URL. A standard page will begin with 'http://' 
          where as a secure web page will begin with 'https://'.
		  <br>
		  <br>
          <b><a name="4"></a>4. What personal information is collected? </b>
		  <br>
          The GraysOnline Online Auction Registration Form requires potential bidders at an online auction to provide:
        <ol type="a">
          <li> their contact details and billing information (such as name, password/login, 
            address, e-mail address, delivery and billing address), credit card 
            details and expiry date. 
          </li><li>demographic information such as gender and date of birth
          </li><li>purchasing preferences</li>
          <li>miscellaneous information such as how you heard about us, whether 
            your purchase is for personal or business use and where you are connected 
            to the web. <br>
          </li>
        </ol>
			<br>
          Again, we stress that this information is transmitted from your Web 
          Browser to our Web server in a secure encrypted format to ensure that 
          your privacy is protected. If the information under 4(a) is not provided 
          then we will be unable to process your bids at an online auction or 
          contact you when items of interest to you come up for auction. 
           <br>
		   <br> 
          As stated above, we will also collect information about the bids you 
          submit for our online auctions such as what you are bidding for, how 
          much you bid, quantity of goods you are bidding for, plus payment if 
          you are the winning bidder. 
            <br>
			<br>
         If you send us correspondence we may also collect this and keep it on your account file. 
            <br>
			<br>
          The GraysOnline server automatically collects additional information 
          about your use of our service. This information can be described as 
          "navigational data" and comprises: browser type; IP address; 
          the URL you come from and go to; links to other sites you click on; 
          the pages you view on our site and time spent on it; cookies; your domain 
          type and service provider. It is standard for many sites to collect 
          this type of information in order to enable them to monitor usage of 
          a site and improve site content and navigation.
            <br>
			<br>
	When a GraysOnline web page is requested and viewed, that request is logged on our servers with 
	information including the IP address of the computer that requested the page.  An IP 
	(Internet Protocol) address is a unique string of numbers that identifies a computer 
	or server on the Internet.  These numbers are normally shown in groups separated by 
	periods.  Your IP address is stored in our bidder database whenever you place a bid, 
	and may be used for various purposes including:-
            <br>
	-  To increase the level of customer security.  IP addresses can be used to validate your bids.
            <br>
	-   Diagnose service or system problems reported by our users that may be associated with 
	IP addresses controlled by a specific Internet Service Provider (ISP)
            <br>
			<br>
        <b><a name="5"></a>5. Where will my personal 
          information be used?</b><br>
           Personal information such as contact details 
          and billing information is collected in order that we can efficiently 
          process your registration and your bids at online auctions. <br>
          <br>
          We also want to make your experience online a satisfying and safe one 
          by making it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services. 
          We therefore ask you to provide other personal information such as purchasing 
          preferences and demographic data. Naturally, we want you to come back 
          and visit us regularly, so we use the data you supply to us, and your 
          bidding history at online auctions to tailor the content we display 
          to you according to your preferences. We may also use it to advise you 
          when certain items of interest to you come up for bidding at auction. 
          Should you so choose, you can opt-out of receiving communications from 
          us at any time, by visiting the "My Info" section, and follow 
          the instructions to unsubscribe.<br>
          <br>
          Navigational data collected by our system that identifies you personally 
          will not be used. Rather, GraysOnline may combine navigational data 
          and use the aggregated results (i.e. results which do not identify any 
          individual) in order to create a better online experience for you. We 
          do this by using the aggregated data to monitor site usage, for marketing 
          to banner advertisers and to improve the look, content and navigation 
          of the site. 
           <br>
		   <br> 
        <b><a name="6"></a>6. Will my personal information be given to anyone else?</b><br>
           Our warehouse does supply your name, delivery 
          address and telephone number to our courier for the dispatch of your 
          purchases, but we require them to keep this information confidential. 
	  In addition, your details may be passed on to third parties where necessary, 
	  for the purpose of processing and collecting any amounts which may become payable by you to us.

          Your initials and the name of your suburb and state are disclosed while 
          you are bidding in an online auction. The reason for this disclosure 
          is to allow actual and potential bidders to track the bidding for particular 
          items at online auctions. <br>
          <br>
          GraysOnline uses cookies to keep track of your bidding. These cookies 
          are placed in your browser file on your hard drive and help us collect 
          general information about visitor behaviour on our site, track password 
          functions and to help us develop better functionality within our site. 
          Cookies do not capture or track any personal information and cannot 
          identify individual users. We may also use an outside advertising company 
          to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. Cookies received 
          with banner ads are collected by our advertising company, and GraysOnline 
          does not have access to, or control over, this information. <br>
          <br>
          You may also elect not to accept cookies on your browser. This should 
          not adversely affect your experience when visiting the GraysOnline superstore. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Our site may from time to time contain links to other sites. We stress 
          that these sites may have a different privacy policy to GraysOnline's 
          and you should check this with them.

          <b><a name="7"></a>7. How will 
          GraysOnline keep my personal information safe? </b>
		  <br>
          The most important thing to remember here 
          is to always keep your GraysOnline login and password secret. Never 
          give your login and password to anyone. GraysOnline encrypts the transmission 
          of personal data between your Web browser and our Web server so information 
          remains secure when sent to us. Additionally, personal information received 
          from you is stored in a system that is not connected to the Internet 
          and is not accessible in any way. GraysOnline operates with a VeriSign 
          Digital Server Certificate, featuring today's state of the art cryptographic 
          techniques to ensure that Digital ID's are not forged or tampered with. 
  			<br>
			<br>        
        <b><a name="8"></a>8. Can I correct or 
          update my personal information? </b><br>
           Once you have registered for online auctions 
          with GraysOnline, you may at anytime access and modify the personal 
          information you provided in the Registration Form by visiting <a href="https://www.graysonline.com.au/app/myinfo/">My 
          Info</a>. This includes updating your delivery address to ensure items 
          are sent to the correct location or providing an updated contact telephone 
          number should we need to contact you regarding delivery as well as altering 
          your credit and details.
          <br>
		  <br>    
         In order to ensure that we can provide 
          you with the most efficient service we ask that you alter your profile, 
          if necessary, before submitting further online bids for online auctions. 
          You can also add or delete or alter your purchase preferences so that 
          we can provide you with a better service. The My Info section of the 
          GraysOnline web site will also allow you to review other information 
          such as your bidding history at online auction.
            <br>
			<br>
          GraysOnline will also take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently 
          de-identify personal information if it is no longer required or if you 
          ask us to do so because you no longer intend to use our site. However, 
          due to technical and accounting constraints your personal information 
          may not be completely destroyed. GraysOnline may also need to retain 
          personal information in order to fulfil legal responsibilities or resolve 
          disputes which may arise.
