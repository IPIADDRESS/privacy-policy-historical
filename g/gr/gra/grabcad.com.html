		<strong>GrabCAD® Privacy Policy</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		This privacy policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) governs our, Stratasys, Inc.'s (“<strong>Stratasys</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”), information collection, processing and usage practices in connection with the use of the website <a href="https://grabcad.com">https://grabcad.com</a> (the "<strong>Site</strong>") and/or any <span class="italic">GrabCAD</span>-branded software products or services, or related hardware, that we operate or provide ("<strong>Applications</strong>", and together with the Site, the "<strong>Services</strong>"). The section and sub-section headings used below are for convenience of reading only (and are not to be used for interpretive purposes), but we hope they make navigating this Privacy Policy easier.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Services may not be hosted by us – all or some of the hosting is done by third party service providers that we engage. This means that data you provide us or that we or third parties collect from you (including any Personal Information, as defined below) is hosted with such third party service providers on servers that they own or control. Regardless of where such third party service providers are located (and some are located in the US), their servers may be located anywhere in the world (including the US). Your data may even be replicated across multiple servers located in multiple countries. So please be aware that you are consenting to your data being transferred to various third party service providers around the world (including the US) for such hosting purposes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Generally speaking, Stratasys receives information because:

				Third parties we engage (such as data analytics providers) collect it from you on our behalf. This happens in cases where we use or deploy third party tracking technology, or where we otherwise give these third parties access to the Site, Applications, and other technology. <strong>So where we describe below in Section ‎3 <span class="italic">(Information We Collect From You)</span> the ways in which we collect information from you, you acknowledge that such collection may also be carried out by third parties.</strong> These third parties may have their own privacy policies that they adhere to, so they won't necessarily adhere to this Privacy Policy; however, we do try to engage third parties that post a privacy policy. Also, just as with our third party hosting providers, these third parties may be based (and their servers may be located) anywhere in the world.

				<strong>Consent and Modification.</strong> You are not legally obligated to provide us with Personal Information, and you confirm that providing us with Personal Information is at your own free will. By using any part of the Services, you hereby consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the practices described herein. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or otherwise use any part of the Services. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such change will be effective ten (10) days following posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Site, and your continued use of any part of the Services thereafter means that you accept those changes.

				<p>
					<span class="underline">Account</span>. In order to use certain Applications, you may be required to create an account (“<strong>Account</strong>”), which will require you (or in some cases, may just give you the option) to provide Personal Information, such as your name and email address. We may also offer the option of creating an Account through connecting via a third party account (a "<strong>Third Party Account</strong>"), in which case you will be required to approve the connection as well as the types of information (which may include Personal Information) that is made available to us from, and the types of activities that we may perform in connection with, that Third Party Account. Even if you later disconnect your Account from the Third Party Account, we still keep a copy of the Personal Information that we received from the connection of the two accounts.

			<div class="content">
				<span class="underline">Log Files; Device and Usage Data</span>. We collect information through server log files, but also by deploying tracking technologies within the Site and the Applications, and we may also associate this information with your Account. We do this to analyze trends, track user movement around the Site and Applications, gather demographic information, and to generally collect information that we may find insightful or helpful. The type of information collected may include (but is not limited to) internet protocol (IP) addresses (which may vary from session to session), MAC address, mobile network information including phone number, device type and hardware model, browser type, operating system type, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp of Site or Application use, referring/exit pages, and clicked pages.

We use cookies to administer, and provide you with access to, the Site and such Applications; but we also use cookies to improve the user experience of the Site and such Applications (for example, cookies and other technologies may serve to recall an IP address previously indicated by a user) and to collect statistical or anonymous data about how you and other users use and interact with the Site and such Applications, which may include for the purpose of serving advertisements. Some of the cookies are set by us, and some may be set by third parties, in which case the third party hosts it (for example, social plug-ins, such as a "Like" button, involve the setting of cookies by the applicable third party). If you do not want to receive cookies, consult your respective browser settings. This may allow you to receive notifications when cookies are set, or to otherwise block cookies altogether. You may also be able to delete cookies that have already been set. If you do block or restrict cookies, various features and functionality of the Site and/or Applications may be impaired.
