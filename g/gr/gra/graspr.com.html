This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services  and website, located at the URL: <a href="/PrivacyPolicy/">http://www.graspr.com/PrivacyPolicy/</a> (the “Site”) offered by Graspr Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies. <br>
        <a name="information" id="information"></a><strong>Information we collect:</strong> <br>
      We offer a number of services  that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal  information to us, for instance, you can  watch videos on Graspr without having a Graspr account. &nbsp;To use certain other services on Graspr, however,  for example, uploading videos, posting comments or watching restricted videos, we  require you to have a Graspr account. In order to provide a full range of  services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <div align="justify" class="style4">
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Information you provide when registering for a Graspr account or       completing a profile</strong> - When you sign up for a <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_faq.html#account">Graspr account</a> or other Graspr service or       promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information such       as your email address, username and account password. We may combine the       information you submit when registering for your account with information       from your use of other Graspr services or third parties in order to       provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our       services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out       of combining such information. In addition, if you complete a profile on       the Site, we may also collect       personal information such as your first and last name, state of residence,       hobbies, preferences and any other contact information that you       voluntarily transmit with your communication to us. </li>
        <li><strong>Graspr cookies</strong> <strong>and web beacons</strong> - When you visit the Site, we send one or more       cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your       computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve       the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user       trends. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can       reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is       being sent. However, some Graspr features and services may not function       properly if your cookies are disabled. We       may record information about your usage, such as when you use Graspr       services, channels, groups, and favorites you subscribe to, the contacts       you communicate with, and the frequency and size of data transfers, as       well as information you display or click on in Graspr (including UI       elements, settings, and other information). If you are logged in, we may       associate that information with your account. We may use clear GIFs       (a.k.a. "Web Beacons") in HTML-based emails sent to our users to       track which emails are opened by recipients. </li>
        <li><strong>Log information</strong> - When you use Graspr       services, our servers automatically record information that your browser       sends whenever you visit a website.

        <li><strong>User communications</strong> - When you send email       or other communication to Graspr, we may retain those communications in       order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our       services. </li>
        <li><strong>Affiliated sites</strong> - We offer some of       our services in connection with, and/or link to, other web sites. Personal       information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Graspr in order       to deliver the service. We process such information in accordance with       this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites may have different privacy practices,       and we encourage you to read their privacy policies. </li>
