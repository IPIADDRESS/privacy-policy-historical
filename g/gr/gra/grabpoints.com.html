<p><b>4. Cookies</b><br>Some of the advertisers and Web analytics firms used on our Site or in connection with our Client ads may place “tracking cookies” on your device.

Our partners use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes.
