					<span class="sublft">Your information is secure. </span>We will never release your e-mail or postal address (or any personal information) to any other company or agency.
					<p><span class="sublft">Unsubscribe from our mailings at any time.</span> If at any time you no longer want to receive information about product upgrades from us, just let us know. You can email sales@graphpad.com or call 858-454-5577 and asked to be removed from our mailing list. Please note that we sometimes mail promotional material to addresses provided by societies and companies, and you may receive these mailings even if you are removed from our mailing list.</p>
					<p><span class="sublft">Your credit card number is safe.</span> When you order software online, your credit card number is encrypted (scrambled) with state-of-the-art technology so that no one else can read it. Your credit card transaction is cleared in seconds through Verisign, an industry leader in secure online purchasing. Thanks to encryption, we believe that online ordering is now safer than giving your card number to a telephone operator, or handing your card to a waiter in a restaurant. There is no safer way to make a purchase. Only the last four digits of your credit card number is stored on&nbsp;our computers.</p>
					<p><span class="sublft">No abuse of cookies.</span> Our web site only uses "cookies" when you request personal support through the web form. The cookie only stores your email address, so you don't have to enter it again on future visits. We do not use cookies to monitor your web usage or to obtain information from your system.</p>
					<p><span class="sublft">No hidden&nbsp;information is sent via the internet.</span> Our programs do not collect any information about your computer system or usage, and never transmit any information over the internet. Prism and InStat have commands on the help menu to view the GraphPad web site. These commands simply launch your web browser, and do not send other information. Prism has a command on the file menu to send mail. This command simply launches your email program, and creates a new message with a copy of the Prism file attached. No information is sent to GraphPad unless you address the email to us.</p>
