							<p>This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which GraphPad Software, LLC (hereafter also referred to as “GraphPad” “we” and “us”) collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a “User” or “you”) for our software, websites, products, and services (together, collectively the “Service”). &nbsp;By accessing the Service, you acknowledge and agree to this Privacy Policy and also agree to the <a href="/company/terms/">Terms of Use</a> of the Service located at: <a href="https://www.graphpad.com/company/terms/">https://www.graphpad.com/company/terms/</a></p>

							<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the data you input into our Service or the files generated by using our Service (“Your Content”).</p>

							<p>We reserve the right to make any changes to our privacy policy at any time, notice of which may be posted on this privacy page at <a href="https://www.graphpad.com/company/privacy-policy/">https://www.graphpad.com/company/privacy-policy/</a>. &nbsp;Users must refer back to our privacy policy to read any changes in our privacy policy.</p>

							<p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>

							<p>Account Information. &nbsp;When establishing an account with our Service, you may provide us with personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). &nbsp;Personal Information that we collect may include, but is not limited to, your name, mailing address, phone number, and email address.</p>

							<p>Usage Data. &nbsp;Besides the Personal information, we may also collect other information regarding your activity during your use of the Service including, but not limited to, session duration, time between sessions, searches made during a session, actions taken, log in time, log out time, and other behavioral data (collectively, “Usage Information”). &nbsp;</p>

							<p>Location Data. &nbsp;We collect your IP address and infer location information such as city or postal code from your IP address, as needed, in order to provide the Services or send you communications. &nbsp;</p>

							<p>When you use the Service, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Service. &nbsp;This information may include, but is not limited to, your computer’s Internet Protocol address (IP address) or other identifier, your general location, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to the Service, and in-bound tracking, namely, the source (ad, social media channel or blog, search engine) which made you aware of the Service. &nbsp;</p>

							<p></p>

							<p>We may collect the information provided in your &nbsp;feedback, questions, information provided when you interact with our technical support representatives. &nbsp;Your conversations with our technical support representatives may be recorded and monitored to improve our service, troubleshoot and protect against errors, and process and resolve your complaints or questions. &nbsp;We may also collect and use any files that you send to us for troubleshooting in order to improve our Service.</p>

							<p></p>

							<p><strong>How We Use the Information Collected</strong></p>

							<p>The Personal Information and Usage Information we collect from the Service will be used mainly as follows: (i) to confirm your software license and confirm product activation; (ii) to provide, maintain, protect and improve the Service (including data analytics), (ii) to respond to your submissions, questions, comments, requests and complaints and provide customer service; (iii) as part of our efforts to keep the Service and integrations safe and secure; (iv) to protect GraphPad’s rights or property; (v) for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, customization, and improvements to service and experience on the Service; (vi) to send you confirmations, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages; and (vii) for any other legitimate business purpose for which the information was collected. We may use information to provide online advertising on the Service and to send you information we think may be useful or relevant to you. You may opt out of email marketing by using the unsubscribe link in a marketing email or you may opt out by altering your account settings.</p>

							<p>We may anonymize and aggregate data collected through the Service and use it for any purpose and share with other partners or third parties.</p>

							<p>For personal data that is subject to General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”), we rely on several legal bases to process your data, which include (i) when you have given consent, which you may withdraw at any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@graphpad.com">support@graphpad.com</a>; (ii) when data processing is necessary to perform a contract with you, such as the <a href="/company/terms/">Terms of Use</a>, and (iii) our legitimate business interests, such as improving and personalizing the Services, marketing new features or products that may be of &nbsp;interest to you, and promoting safety and security of the Services and our Customers.</p>

							<p>GraphPad may on occasion combine information collected with additional records (such as information from affiliated companies, partners, distributors, or outside vendors, and publicly available information, including on social media sites). &nbsp;The combined information may be used for purposes such as to market products, features, or services that may be of interest to you, or for research and analytics.</p>

							<p><strong>Sharing Information with Third Parties</strong></p>

							<p>GraphPad may share your information: (i) where your consent is obtained, such as when you choose to opt-in to the sharing of data; (ii) with vendors and service providers retained in connection with provision of the Service, including for data analytics purposes (iii) to comply with law enforcement requests and legal process (such as a court order or subpoena) legal action or law enforcement (“Legal Reasons”); (iv) to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our <a href="/company/terms/">Terms of Use</a> &nbsp;or our other policies or agreements; (v) respond to your requests; (vi) protect GraphPad’s, your, or others’ legal rights and/or property (“Prevent Harm”); or (vii) if GraphPad is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, in which case the use of your information will be governed by the provisions of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time GraphPad collected such information. We use Google Analytics and Amplitude Analytics for data analytics. If you do not want these providers to collect and use information about your use of the Service, then you can install an opt-out or analytics blocking extension in your web browser, such as &nbsp;https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.</p>

							<p><a name="choice"><strong>Choice &amp; Control</strong></a></p>

							<p>We know members of our community value having control over their own information, and therefore GraphPad gives you the choice of providing, editing or removing certain information, as well as choice over how we contact you. &nbsp;Should you wish to provide, change, or remove information, or alter communication preferences, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@graphpad.com">support@graphpad.com</a>. &nbsp;If you live in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland (“Designated Region”), you have several legal rights regarding your information as discussed below. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

							<p>For various reasons, GraphPad may contact you about our services or your activity. Some of these messages are required, service-related messages for members.</p>

							<p>Objecting or Restricting Data Use. &nbsp;You have options to control our use of your data. &nbsp;You may limit how your information is visible to other users or made publicly available and limit the notifications or emails you receive from us by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@graphpad.com">support@graphpad.com</a>. &nbsp;Please note that should you opt-out of receiving notifications or emails from us, you will still receive administrative messages from us. &nbsp;</p>
