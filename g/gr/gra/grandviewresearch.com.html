<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY EFFECTIVE DATE: </strong>November 26, 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1.1. PURPOSE OF POLICY. Grand View Research, Inc. (“us,” “we,” or “Company”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of the Company Website (the “Site”). We created this Website Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) to give you confidence as you visit and use the Site, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1.2. NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PLEASE NOTE: We are a general audience site, and do not direct any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of age. We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children’s privacy online. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a Site user is under age 13, we will promptly delete any personal information in that user’s account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2.1. WHAT BASIC INFORMATION DOES THE COMPANY COLLECT?</p>
