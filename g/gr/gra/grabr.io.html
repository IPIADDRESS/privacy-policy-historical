Grabr submits transfers daily, however most bank institutions only process payments on business days. That said, if Grabr submits your payment on a holiday or weekend, your payment processing will most likely initiate on the following business day. If you do not see the payment in your account within 5-7 business days, this probably means that the transfer has failed. In this case, your bank will contact us within 5-7 business days to inform Grabr of the incomplete transfer.

We wait seven days after your first successful charge before sending the first electronic transfer to your bank account.

As a result, we hold all pending transfers to your account until the issue with your bank account is resolved. If you update your bank account in your profile with a valid checking account, the failed transfers will automatically be retried.
