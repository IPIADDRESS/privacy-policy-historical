                                    <p>You linked to this Privacy Policy via a website owned by   Cardone Training Technologies Corporation ("brand website"). This policy applies   to all online communication with Cardone Training Technologies Corporation owned   brands. When you provide us with online information through this Website, we   respect your privacy. It is important for you to understand what information we   collect about you during your visit and what we do with that information. Please   note that your visit to our Website is subject to this Privacy Policy and our   Terms and Conditions.</p>
                                    <p>At all times, we reserve the right to disclose any   information, including personally identifiable information, to comply with any   applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; to protect   Cardone Training Technologies Corporation rights or property (including without   limitation in the event of a transfer of control of a Cardone Training   Technologies Corporation company, affiliate, or brand, or substantially all of   its assets), or during emergencies when safety is at risk, or for credit fraud   protection and risk reduction purposes.</p>
                                    <p>1. Information Collection and Use</p>
                                    <p>We only collect personally identifiable information about   you via this Website when you provide it in connection with a request for a   product, service, or information. For example, if you decide to place an order,   we will ask you for your delivery and billing address, phone number(s), email   address, credit card number and its expiration date. If you decide to complete a   user registration form or survey, we may ask you for information such as your   contact information (e.g., name, e-mail address and mailing address), age group   or birth date. When you submit your personally identifiable information on this   Website, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of   your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Cardone Training   Technologies Corporation companies may use the information that you provide to   fulfill your request for a product, information, or other service, or respond to   an email or other request, as well as to create and deliver to you our   newsletters or surveys, communications containing product information, usage   tips or promotions, help improve our website(s) or services, or customize   visitors' experience at our website(s). We do not share your credit card or   other account information with unaffiliated third parties unless you authorize   us to do so, or if it is necessary to fulfill our responsibilities including,   but not limited to, delivering a product or service that you order. If you   prefer not to receive email marketing communications from us or from third   parties, please see Section 7 below. You cannot opt-out of receiving   communications from Cardone Training Technologies Corporation (or third parties   who may assist us) relating to a specific order or request for a product or   service. If you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable   information from you, please do not provide us with any such information.</p>
                                    <p>We may also collect, store or accumulate certain   non-personally identifiable information concerning your use of this Website,   such as information regarding which of our pages are most popular. Information   gathered may be used in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as   generating statistics and developing marketing plans. We may share or transfer   such aggregate, non-personally identifiable information with or to our   affiliates, licensees and partners.</p>
                                    <p>This Website is intended for adults. We do not knowingly   collect personal information from children under the age of 13. However, if the   parent or guardian of a child under 13 believes that the child has provided us   with personally identifiable information, the parent or guardian of that child   should contact us at <a title="mailto:privacy@grantcardone.com" href="mailto:privacy@grantcardone.com">privacy@grantcardone.com</a> if they want   this information deleted from our files so that it is not in retrievable form.   If we otherwise obtain knowledge that we have personally identifiable   information about a child under 13 in retrievable form in our files, we will   delete that information from our existing files so that it is not   retrievable.</p>
                                    <p>2. Ensuring Your Security</p>
                                    <p>We use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced security   protocol that protects your credit card information and ensures secure online   ordering. SSL Internet connections are encrypted, and thus protect all credit   card ordering information, including your name, address and credit card number,   so it cannot be read in transit. We use secure technology, privacy protection   controls, and restrictions on employee access, to safeguard your personal   information.</p>
                                    <p>3. Safe Shopping Guarantee</p>
                                    <p>We guarantee that every online transaction you make will be   "100% safe". This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your   card as a result of shopping at our online store. It is determined that under   the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than   $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this   $50.00, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We   will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card   resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using the secure   server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify   your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and   procedures.</p>
                                    <p>4. Technology Utilized</p>
                                    <p>There are two commonly used technologies used on this site,   clear gifs and cookies. We use these to monitor the performance of the site and   to measure it's effectiveness. "Cookies" are small pieces of information stored   by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We do not use cookies to obtain   any personally identifying information. Most web browsers automatically accept   cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent this. Please be   assured that accepting a cookie does not give us access to your computer or   personal information under any circumstances. If you disable cookies, you may be   unable to order or use other features of our sites. If you experience any   problems, please email us at <a title="mailto:customerservice@grantcardone.com" href="mailto:customerservice@grantcardone.com">customerservice@grantcardone.com</a>.</p>
                                    <p>Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier,   similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of   Web users. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable   information.</p>
                                    <p>5. Third Parties</p>
                                    <p>We may rely on other companies and individuals to perform   functions on our behalf. Examples include data analysis firms, customer support   specialists, webhosting companies, and fulfillment companies (e.g., companies   that fill product orders or coordinate mailings). We may share personally   identifiable information with such third parties as appropriate for them to   perform their functions, but they may not use such information for any other   purpose. We may also share personally identifiable information with marketing   partners or other direct marketers, so they can send you notices about their   products or services. If you do not want to receive email marketing   communications, see section 7 below for opt-out information.</p>
                                    <p>Our website may offer links to and from other third party   sites. Other sites have their own policies regarding privacy. If you visit one   of these sites, you may want to review the privacy policy on that site. For   example, you may have linked to the Cardone Training Technologies Corporation   brand site through a banner advertisement on another site. In such cases the   site you have linked from may collect information from people who click on the   banner or link. You may want to refer to the privacy policies on those sites to   see how they collect and use this information.</p>
                                    <p>6. Notification of Changes</p>
                                    <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we   decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised policy here. As we   may make changes at any time without notifying you, we suggest that you   periodically consult this Privacy Policy.</p>
                                    <p>7. Email Marketing</p>
                                    <p>We want to communicate with you via email correspondence   only if you want to hear from us. When you purchase a Cardone Training   Technologies Corporation product, we may from time to time send you email   messages describing new products, special offers, and great values. If for any   reason you would no longer like to receive email messages from the Cardone   Training Technologies Corporation brand product you purchased, you can submit a   removal request. Please allow up to 10 days for us to process your   request.</p>
                                    <p>Your privacy is important to us, and for this reason we   will never share or sell your email address with any third parties for direct   marketing purposes. Please note, if you decide not to receive marketing emails   from a Cardone Training Technologies Corporation brand, you may still receive   “Transactional” email messages regarding your order (i.e. order confirmation,   shipping information, customer service notifications, etc.) If you have   questions or concerns regarding this statement, please contact us at <a title="mailto:privacy@grantcardone.com" href="mailto:privacy@grantcardone.com">privacy@grantcardone.com</a></p>
                                    <p>8. Information Sharing Preferences</p>
                                    <p>We may share information with carefully selected vendors,   business partners and other organizations that are not part of the Cardone   Training Technologies Corporation family (as mentioned, your e-mail address is   not shared). These companies and organizations may use the information we share   to provide special opportunities and offers to you.</p>
                                    <p>If you do not want us to share information you provide with   vendors, business partners and other organizations that are not part of the   Cardone Training Technologies family, please notify us at <a title="mailto:privacy@grantcardone.com" href="mailto:privacy@grantcardone.com">privacy@grantcardone.com</a> or send a   fax marked "attn: opt-out" including your name, complete address and email   address to 310-777-0256. Please note that these requests may take up to six to   eight weeks to become effective.</p>
