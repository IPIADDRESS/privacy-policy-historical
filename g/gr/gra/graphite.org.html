<hr><p style="margin-top: 20px;"><a name="privacy-policy" id="privacy-policy"></a><strong>GRAPHITE PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Effective Date of Policy: June 17, 2014</p>
<p>Welcome! Below you will find Common Sense Media, Inc.'s privacy policy for Graphite. We are dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal information we obtain from you with care and respect. This Privacy Policy (the "<strong>Policy</strong>" or the "<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>") is designed to answer your questions regarding how we collect, protect, use and share information obtained through the Graphite website, <a href="http://www.graphite.org">www.graphite.org</a> (the "<strong>Site</strong>"). Common Sense Media also maintains other websites and mobile applications, which are governed by their own privacy policies. If you are using another Common Sense Media website or app, please be sure to consult the applicable privacy policy, as it may differ from this Policy. As used in this Policy, Common Sense Media and any and all affiliated or contracted entities which may perform certain of the services provided on this Site are collectively referred to herein as "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>" or "<strong>our</strong>". We hope this information increases your confidence in Common Sense Media and enhances your experience on our Site.</p>
<p>Please see our separate <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>, which governs the use of the Site. <strong>We encourage you to read this Policy before using the Site, and not to use the Site if you disagree with any part of this Policy. By using this Site or by clicking a box that states that you accept or agree to this Policy, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Policy.</strong></p>
<p>The Site is controlled and operated by a nonprofit organization in the United States, and is not intended to subject Common Sense Media or any affiliated entity to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. We may limit the Site's availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time in our sole discretion.</p>
<p><strong>I. INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT ON THE SITE</strong></p>
<p>Through the Site, you can be a part of an active and vibrant community of teachers interested in the impact of media on their students. Visitors who complete the membership process through our Site may become registered members ("<strong>Members</strong>"). Members can engage in a full range of activities on our Site, such as posting comments on articles, creating user reviews on media products, participating in surveys and polls, and saving favorites to a personal page. If you are not currently a Member, you may <a href="/user/register">click here</a> to register and become eligible for all of our Site's features.</p>
<p><strong>A. Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>In this Policy, when we use the term "<strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>", we mean any information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as the individual's name, postal address, email address and telephone number. We collect different types of Personally Identifiable Information depending on whether you are a Non-Member or a Member, as explained below. Personally Identifiable Information does not include screen names (also known as member names, usernames or other online aliases) provided by our adult users in the course of registering with or using the Site.</p>
<p>Visitors to the Site may register and opt-in to receive the Graphite email newsletter by providing their email address. We also may collect Personally Identifiable Information through surveys or questionnaires. Your participation in surveys and questionnaires is entirely voluntary.</p>
<p>If you wish to become a Member, you must provide us with certain Personally Identifiable Information as part of the registration process, including first and last name, email address, password and school information, as applicable.</p>
<p>If you wish to become a Member, you may optionally choose to provide us with other information, including city, state, ZIP, and country of residence.</p>
<p>In order to simplify the Site's registration and login process we provide you with the option to register or login and link your Member account on the Site with a third-party social networking service, such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter (each a "<strong><em>Social Networking Service</em></strong>"). These services will authenticate your identity, will allow you to login on the Site using the single social login buttons, and will share certain personal information that you allow us to collect, as discussed <a href="#social-login">below</a>.</p>
<p>When you provide us with your name on your public user profile ("<strong>Profile</strong>") page, your first name and the first initial of your last name will be displayed on your Profile page and next to any reviews or comments that you post on our Site.</p>
<p>Your first name and the first initial of your last name identify you on the Site This information is included in your Profile that is viewable by other Members and is displayed with reviews and comments that you write.</p>
<p>If you decide that you no longer want to be a Member you can remove your account from the Site at any time by <a href="mailto:privacy@graphite.org">contacting us</a>.</p>
<p>It is possible that Personally Identifiable Information and other data that you furnished through the Site may remain in our system (such as in backups of the Site’s data), even if you are no longer a Member, and can be used by us in accordance with this Policy. PLEASE NOTE THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE IN YOUR PROFILE OR ON PUBLIC-FACING AREAS OF THE SITE.</p>
<p><strong>B. Collection of Information by Our Service Providers. </strong></p>
<p>We use a third-party service provider, clickandpledge.com (the "<strong>Payment Service</strong>"), to handle donations made by credit card and other payment transactions submitted to our Site. If you wish to make a donation through the Site, you will be directed to a webpage that is hosted by the Payment Service (or its service providers) and not by us (such page, the "Payment Service Page"). Any Personally Identifiable Information that you provide through the <strong>Payment Service Page</strong> will be collected directly by the Payment Service rather than by us, and will be subject to the Payment Service’s privacy policy (located at <a href="https://clickandpledge.com/Privacy" target="_new">https://clickandpledge.com/Privacy</a>) rather than this Policy. We have no control over, and shall not be responsible for, the Payment Service's use of information collected through the Payment Service Page. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION THROUGH THE PAYMENT SERVICE PAGE OR THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF THE PAYMENT SERVICE.</p>
<p><strong>C. Cookies and Other Technologies</strong></p>
<p>We may also collect certain information automatically when you visit the Site, such as the browser you are using (e.g., Safari, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.), the internet address from which you linked to our Site, the operating system of your computer (e.g., Microsoft Windows, iOS, Android, etc.), the unique IP address of the computer you used to access our Site and usage and browsing habits. We use this information to administer and improve your experience on our Site, to help diagnose and troubleshoot potential server malfunctions, and to gather broad demographic information.</p>
<p>To help make sure you receive information that is relevant to you, our Site uses data "cookies," which are small data files stored on your computer and identify you as a previous visitor to the Site and help us to personalize your experience when you arrive. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. You can instruct your browser not to accept cookies. However, if you disable this function, you will not be able to use some of the features on our Site.</p>
<p>Our web pages and our e-mail newsletters may contain "web beacons." Web beacons are small pieces of data embedded with images on pages of the Site or in emails, which allow us to collect information such as the number of users that have visited a web page or opened an email. We use web beacons to measure the effectiveness of our content and how visitors use our Site. This allows us to learn what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which parts of our Site are the most interesting and what kind of offers our visitors like to see.</p>
<p><strong>D. Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information, demographic information, high-level location information, such as the browser language and country during the user session, and other information that does not reveal a person's specific identity. We may collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (e.g., interests, zip codes, etc.) when you voluntarily provide such information to us, such as through survey responses. Such information constitutes Non-Personally Identifiable Information because, unless combined with your name or other Personally Identifiable Information, it does not personally identify you or any other user.</p>
<p>Additionally, we may aggregate Personally Identifiable Information in such a manner that the end product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site. For example, we might use Personally Identifiable Information to calculate the percentage of our Members who teach in a particular state. Such aggregate information is considered Non-Personally Identifiable Information for purposes of this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. HOW WE USE INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THE SITE</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. How We Use Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>We use Personally Identifiable Information to process requests made through our Site, such as requests to receive our e-newsletters, requests for membership and questions or comments submitted through our Site. You can unsubscribe from our email newsletter by updating your subscription selection in the “My Account” section of your account, clicking the “unsubscribe” link located at the bottom of all newsletters, or by visiting graphite.org/contact and sending this request using our online form.</p>
<p><em>Fulfillment of Requests.</em> We may use Personally Identifiable Information about you to fulfill the purpose for which such information was provided (e.g., to send newsletters to you or respond to your requests or inquiries).</p>
<p><em>Additional Communications.</em> If you register to become a Member of our community or sign up to receive one of our e-newsletters, we may use the Personally Identifiable Information submitted in connection with your application to contact you with surveys or important communications regarding Graphite.</p>
<p><em>Membership.</em> If you become a Member, we may use your Personally Identifiable Information to maintain and update your Profile and postings in our online reviews, surveys and polls. All content that you submit to the Site is governed by our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to send updates and communications to our Members, such as our e-newsletters, surveys and other important Graphite communications such as information regarding the Site or changes to our terms, conditions and policies.</p>
<p><em>Internal Operations and Analysis.</em> We may also use Personally Identifiable Information about you for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits and so forth.</p>
<p><strong>B. How We Use Information Collected Via Cookies and Other Technologies</strong></p>
<p>We use information collected via cookies, web beacons and other technologies to personalize your visit. With this data, we can provide content applicable to your general location and interests. We use this information to administer and improve your experience on our Site, to help diagnose and troubleshoot potential server malfunctions and to gather broad demographic information.</p>
<p><strong>C. How We Use Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>Because Non-Personally Identifiable Information does not personally identify you, we may use or disclose such information for any purpose. For instance, we may compile and share aggregate data about the ages, geographic locations or other demographics of our Members, provided that this information does not personally identify any of these Members.</p>

If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, you should immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the section below entitled “Contacting Us.” Please note that if you notify us by physical mail, this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem.</p>
