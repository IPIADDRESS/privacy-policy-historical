<p><strong>What do you do with the information I give you when I register?</strong></p>
<p>We register users in order to protect our community and allow our Members to share comments, write reviews, save favorites and gain access to additional resources.

<p>Your first name and the first initial of your last name identify you on the Site This information is included in your Profile that is viewable by other Members and is displayed with reviews and comments that you write.</p>
<p>If you decide that you no longer want to be a Member you can remove your account from the Site at any time by <a href="mailto:privacy@graphite.org">contacting us</a>.</p>
<p>It is possible that Personally Identifiable Information and other data that you furnished through the Site may remain in our system (such as in backups of the Site’s data), even if you are no longer a Member, and can be used by us in accordance with this Policy. PLEASE NOTE THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE IN YOUR PROFILE OR ON PUBLIC-FACING AREAS OF THE SITE.</p>
<p><strong>B. Collection of Information by Our Service Providers. </strong></p>
<p>We use a third-party service provider, clickandpledge.com (the "<strong>Payment Service</strong>"), to handle donations made by credit card and other payment transactions submitted to our Site. If you wish to make a donation through the Site, you will be directed to a webpage that is hosted by the Payment Service (or its service providers) and not by us (such page, the "Payment Service Page"). Any Personally Identifiable Information that you provide through the <strong>Payment Service Page</strong> will be collected directly by the Payment Service rather than by us, and will be subject to the Payment Service’s privacy policy (located at <a href="https://clickandpledge.com/Privacy" target="_new">https://clickandpledge.com/Privacy</a>) rather than this Policy. We have no control over, and shall not be responsible for, the Payment Service's use of information collected through the Payment Service Page. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION THROUGH THE PAYMENT SERVICE PAGE OR THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF THE PAYMENT SERVICE.</p>
<p><strong>C. Cookies and Other Technologies</strong></p>
<p>We may also collect certain information automatically when you visit the Site, such as the browser you are using (e.g., Safari, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.), the internet address from which you linked to our Site, the operating system of your computer (e.g., Microsoft Windows, iOS, Android, etc.), the unique IP address of the computer you used to access our Site and usage and browsing habits. We use this information to administer and improve your experience on our Site, to help diagnose and troubleshoot potential server malfunctions, and to gather broad demographic information.</p>
<p>To help make sure you receive information that is relevant to you, our Site uses data "cookies," which are small data files stored on your computer and identify you as a previous visitor to the Site and help us to personalize your experience when you arrive. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. You can instruct your browser not to accept cookies. However, if you disable this function, you will not be able to use some of the features on our Site.</p>
<p>Our web pages and our e-mail newsletters may contain "web beacons." Web beacons are small pieces of data embedded with images on pages of the Site or in emails, which allow us to collect information such as the number of users that have visited a web page or opened an email. We use web beacons to measure the effectiveness of our content and how visitors use our Site. This allows us to learn what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which parts of our Site are the most interesting and what kind of offers our visitors like to see.</p>
<p><strong>D. Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information, demographic information, high-level location information, such as the browser language and country during the user session, and other information that does not reveal a person's specific identity. We may collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (e.g., interests, zip codes, etc.) when you voluntarily provide such information to us, such as through survey responses. Such information constitutes Non-Personally Identifiable Information because, unless combined with your name or other Personally Identifiable Information, it does not personally identify you or any other user.</p>
<p>Additionally, we may aggregate Personally Identifiable Information in such a manner that the end product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site. For example, we might use Personally Identifiable Information to calculate the percentage of our Members who teach in a particular state. Such aggregate information is considered Non-Personally Identifiable Information for purposes of this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. HOW WE USE INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THE SITE</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. How We Use Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>We use Personally Identifiable Information to process requests made through our Site, such as requests to receive our e-newsletters, requests for membership and questions or comments submitted through our Site. You can unsubscribe from our email newsletter by updating your subscription selection in the “My Account” section of your account, clicking the “unsubscribe” link located at the bottom of all newsletters, or by visiting graphite.org/contact and sending this request using our online form.</p>
