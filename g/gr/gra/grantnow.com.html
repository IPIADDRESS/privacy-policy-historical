                Policy with respect to information gathered on Web Pages hosted 
                by Grant Now. Please be aware that we appreciate 
                the trust you place in us by providing information on this 
                web site, and our commitment to you is to use this information 
                with both care and sensitivity. The information we collect 
                from visitors to our web site helps us continually improve 
                the products we offer to our valued customers. Types of information 
                collected are outlined as follows:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="calibri-16"> Any information you voluntarily enter 
                  on our web site is maintained by GrantNow.com to help us improve both the web site and product(s) 
                  advertised on the web site.<br>
                </li>
                <li class="calibri-16"> In addition, we use “cookies” 
                  (as do the vast majority of other companies that do business 
                  on the World Wide Web) when you visit our site, which are 
                  alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s 
                  hard drive through your web browser. Information we collect 
                  and analyze via cookies includes the Internet Protocol (IP) 
                  address used to connect your computer to the Internet, computer 
                  and connection information such as browser type and version, 
                  operating system and platform, date and time of your visit, 
                  and cookie number. If you do not wish to have cookies placed 
                  on your computer, please review the options listed in the 
                  Help portion of the toolbar on your computer. The toolbar 
                  on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser 
                  from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify 
                  you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies 
                  altogether.</li>
