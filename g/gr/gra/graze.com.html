    <h2>Our use of Cookies</h2>

    <p>
        Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track information about your use of that website.  A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your browser. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Site and will last for longer. Although they do identify a user's computer, cookies do not personally identify users.
    </p>

    <p>
        We use cookies for the following key reasons:  
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <em>Essential session management</em>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating a specific log-in session for a visitor to our website in order that the site remembers that a visitor is logged in and that their page requests are delivered in an effective, secure and consistent manner.</li>
                <li>Recognising when a visitor to the website has visited before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive to the website and allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get.</li>
                <li>Recognising when a visitor to the website is a registered member.</li>
                <li>We may also log information from your computer including the existence of cookies, your IP address and information about your browser program in order to allow us to diagnose problems, administer and track your usage of the Services.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <em>Functionality</em>
            <ul>
                <li>Customising elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the website for example by storing a country code and providing users with content relevant to their country.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <em>Performance and measurement</em>
            <ul>
                <li>Collecting statistical information about how our visitors use the website(s) so that we can improve the website(s) and learn which parts are most popular to visitors.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you provide us with an email address, it will be entered into our regular email update service only where you have agreed to receiving such emails. From time to time, we may also contact you by post (where you have indicated that you are happy for us doing so) with information on special offers or events regarding our products or services. If you do not wish to continue to receive updates or marketing information, please amend your preferences in the My Account section of the Site.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>Information Sharing And Disclosure</h3>

    <p>
        We are committed to protecting your personal information. We will not disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent except where:
        
        </p><ul>
            <li>We are required by law to disclose information to third parties.</li>
            <li>The service is necessary for the performance of our operations such as mail delivery, hosting services, protecting us from fraud, and payment of your account.</li>
        </ul>
    <p></p>

    <p>
        Where you have referred a new customer to us your first name and first initial of your surname will be shared with the person you referred to us and you agree to that sharing.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the event that we undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third party, you agree that any personal information we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or third party.
    </p>

    <p>
        Companies and individuals registered in our affiliate program receive aggregate information about customers that they direct to us through links on their website. No personally identifiable information is provided to affiliate members; the information collected from our affiliates is used strictly for the affiliate program and will not be used for general marketing purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
        We also provide analyses of our customers in the aggregate to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties. We do this so that we and our business partners can understand our customers better, and so we can keep bringing you first-rate services. We may also disclose, on an anonymous basis, statements made by our customers such as comments or feedback we receive on or products or service. At no time, however, will we disclose personal information about specific customers to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties.
