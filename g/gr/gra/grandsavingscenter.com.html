        <p><strong><a name="link2" id="link2">HOW DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION AND WHAT
        INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</a></strong></p>

        <p>We collect and combine personally identifiable information (“PII”)
        and non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”) through
        various sources, including those discussed below. For your reference, PII is data
        collected with an intention to specifically identify, contact or locate a person,
        including but not limited to name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address.
        Conversely, Non-PII is data that is not used to specifically identify, contact or
        locate an individual, including but not limited to zip code, gender, age, or IP
        address.</p>

        <p style="text-autospace:none;"><strong>Website Registration Forms</strong></p>

        <p>We collect information about you when you register on one of our websites.
        This registration information may include, but is not limited to your:</p>

          <li>e-mail address</li>

          <li>full name</li>

          <li>mailing address</li>

          <li>telephone number</li>

          <li>date of birth</li>

          <li>gender</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Offer Forms</strong></p>

        <p>We also collect information about you when you complete a survey or offer form
        on one of our websites or web pages. This information may include, but is not
        limited to: your e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number, date of
        birth, gender, and payment information; information about your background,
        interests, health, education, career goals, and shopping preferences; and any
        other personal information or unique preference information you provide to us or
        our advertisers.</p>

        <p><strong>Distribution Partners</strong></p>

        <p>Website operators that license our ad serving technology pass information to
        us so that we may serve advertisements to you. The information passed may
        include, but is not limited to, your IP address, e-mail address, name, mailing
        address, telephone number, date of birth, and gender.</p>

        <p><strong>Publisher Partners</strong></p>

        <p>When you complete a registration or offer form that is hosted by one of our
        website publisher partners on our behalf, the website publisher partner may
        submit all or a portion of the information that you submitted on the form to the
        Company. This information may include, but is not limited to: your IP address,
        e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, gender,
        and payment information; information about your background, interests, health,
        education, career goals, and shopping preferences; and any other information you
        provide to our website publisher partner.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing Partners</strong></p>

        <p>We may receive information about you, including but not limited to your IP
        address, e-mail address, first name, last name, mailing address, and telephone
        number, from third party marketing partners that provide us with consumer data to
        manage on their behalf.</p>

        <p><strong>SMS</strong></p>

        <p>SMS, Wireless and Other Mobile Offerings: Some of the services that we provide
        will result in sending an SMS, wireless or other mobile offering to your cell
        phone. These should be obvious in the context of the offering at the time you
        sign up. By signing up, you are agreeing to receive these mobile offerings. You
        understand that your wireless carrier's standard rates apply to these messages.
        To unsubscribe or discontinue SMS messages, send "STOP", "END", "QUIT" to the SMS
        text message you have received. This process impacts only the future delivery of
        the particular SMS message offering, so you must send that message for each
        offering. This will not affect offerings sent on behalf of third parties.</p>

        <p><strong>IVR</strong></p>

        <p>Your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this website constitutes your
        express written consent to receive telemarketing calls from third-party
        marketers, including by means of a pre-recorded message and automated voice
        dialing. Your consent will be effective regardless of whether the number you have
        provided: (a) is a home, business, or cell phone line; and/or (b) is or will be
        registered on any state or federal Do-Not-Call (DNC) list, and shall remain in
        effect until you revoke your consent by contacting us.</p>

        <p><strong>Automatic Information/Digital Identifiers</strong></p>

        <p>We may automatically receive and store certain types of information about you
        through the data sources listed above.</p>

        <p>You may be familiar with the term “cookies,” which are unique
        alphanumeric identifiers that store information on your computer. A cookie is
        placed on your computer when your web browser accesses our website. We use
        cookies for tracking transactions and the user characteristics explained in
        detail throughout this Privacy Policy<span style="color:blue;">.</span> If you
        choose, there are utilities available for purchase from independent software
        providers to install on your computer as well as tools/preferences you can choose
        through most web browsers to make website visits anonymous. Of course, cookies
        let you have a more satisfying website experience, so we recommend that you leave
        them turned on.</p>

        <p>We may also add third party cookies. Cookies contain anonymous, segmented data
        about a user’s demographics (like age, gender, and location), interests,
        lifestyle, household details, social media memberships, and online influences.
        The date in the cookies do not contain individual-level information, but rather
        general audience segments.</p>

        <p>We also collect information through our web server applications. This
        information includes your Internet Protocol or “IP” address,
        date/time stamp, browser type, and referring URL.</p>

        <p>Additionally, we may use pixel tracking technology to track the completion of
        transactions with us or our advertisers, the source information for those
        transactions, and your IP address, date/time stamp, browser type, and referring
        URL.</p>

        <p><strong>Government Forms</strong></p>

        <p>The Company may be required to create, collect, maintain, and submit certain
        information required by the government, such as IRS Forms W-9 and 1099. This
        information, which may include your taxpayer identification number, will not be
        used, shared, transferred, or sold for marketing purposes.</p>

        <p><strong><a name="link3" id="link3">HOW DO WE USE THIS
        INFORMATION?</a></strong></p>

        <p>We may use the collected PII and Non-PII for any legally permissible purpose
        in our sole discretion, including but not limited to those explained below.</p>

        <p><strong>Ad Serving</strong></p>

        <p>We may serve advertisements to you based, in part, on your IP address, the
        demographic and geographic information you submitted to the Company during the
        website registration process, and other socio-economic information, psychographic
        information, Internet behavior (i.e., browsing, search, shopping, purchase, and
        ad response behavior), and lifestyle information about you that we obtain from
        other Company entities and from third parties.</p>

        <p>We also use third party advertising companies to serve advertisements when you
        visit our websites. These companies may use and optimize information (not
        including your name, mailing address, e-mail address, or telephone number) about
        your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about
        goods and services that may be of interest to you.</p>

        <p><strong>Pre-select/Pre-fill Offers</strong></p>

        <p>Our website technology may pre-select certain offers for you to view based on
        the demographic and geographic information you submitted to the Company during
        the website registration process. Additionally, this technology may pre-fill some
        or all of the offers’ data fields with the information you submitted during
        the website registration process in order to prevent you from having to re-enter
        this information. We may not show all of the pre-filled data fields to you.</p>

        <p><strong>Upsell</strong></p>

        <p>We utilize customized post transactional or "upsell" technology to help
        advertisers generate sales, while providing you with a series of great offers we
        think may be of interest to you. The way it works is simple: once you purchase a
        product or service from one of our reward advertisers, you will be offered
        additional products or services that we think may be of interest to you. If you
        elect to purchase products or services from a third party advertiser in the post
        transactional channel, please input all necessary
        information on the subsequent advertiser form, including, but not limited to, your
        credit card information. You need to complete this information because we do not
        pass this information to the third party advertiser.</p>

        <p><strong>Customer Service and Fulfillment</strong></p>

        <p>We may use your information to operate the website promotion, service your
        account and to fulfill rewards earned through Company websites. We may also use
        your information to verify your identity or claimed account status and, where we
        consider appropriate, investigate your compliance with the terms and conditions
        of the website promotion or any advertiser offer. We do retain customer service
        correspondence.</p>

        <p><strong>Credit Card Preauthorization</strong></p>

        <p>By submitting your credit card information to us or to one of our advertisers,
        you are authorizing the Company or its agent to periodically verify that your
        credit card account is valid and has credit available by charging, and thereafter
        crediting, a small sum to the card.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>

        <p>We may use your information in our online (e.g., e-mail marketing) and offline
        (e.g., telemarketing, cell phone text messaging, skip tracing, and direct mail)
        marketing programs. With respect to telemarketing in particular, you authorize us
        and our third-party marketing partners to call your landline telephone and/or cell
        phone (if provided) and you understand that your wireless carrier's standard rates
        may apply to any calls to your cell phone. If you would like to be removed from
        these programs, <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.GrandSavingsCenter.com/contact.cgi?config=7700&amp;showme=unsub','','scrollbars=yes,width=600,height=402'); return false;">click
        here</a> and follow the opt-out instructions.</p>

        <p><strong>SMS</strong></p>

        <p>SMS, Wireless and Other Mobile Offerings: Some of the services that we provide
        will result in sending an SMS, wireless or other mobile offering to your cell

        the particular SMS message offering, so you must send that message for each
        offering. This will not affect offerings sent on behalf of third parties.</p>

        <p><strong>IVR</strong></p>

        <p>Your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this website constitutes your
        express written consent to receive telemarketing calls from third-party
        marketers, including by means of a pre-recorded message and automated voice

        provided: (a) is a home, business, or cell phone line; and/or (b) is or will be

        effect until you revoke your consent by contacting us.</p>

        <p><strong><a name="link4" id="link4">HOW DO WE SHARE
        INFORMATION?</a></strong></p>

        <p>We may share the collected PII and Non-PII for any legally permissible purpose
        in our sole discretion, including but not limited to those explained below.</p>

        <p><strong>Within the Company</strong></p>

        <p>We may share information we collect with affiliated companies, including our
        parent company and other subsidiaries of our parent company, for use in their ad
        serving and marketing programs. This Privacy Policy does not apply to affiliated
        companies and their collection, use and sharing of information. With respect to
        online behavioral advertising, certain affiliated companies may use
        non-personally identifiable information (which may or may not include click
        stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements
        clicked or scrolled over) collected during your visits to this and other websites
        in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of
        greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party
        web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral
        advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit
        <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Vendors</strong></p>

        <p>We may share your information with various third party vendors that are not
        part of the Company, including but not limited to vendors that provide us with
        technology to deploy commercial e-mail, vendors that sell the products or
        services for which you have qualified through one of our websites, and shipping
        companies that we utilize to ship products to you.</p>

        <p><strong>Advertisers</strong></p>

        <p>When you participate in an offer by completing a form, we will transfer the
        information you submitted on the form to the applicable advertiser.</p>

        <p>When you answer “yes” or “no” to a survey question,
        some or all of the information that you submitted during the website registration
        process will be transferred to advertisers that we believe may be of interest to
        you without providing you with another opportunity to review the information.</p>

        <p>When you select “yes” next to an offer, we will transfer some or
        all of the information that you submitted during the website registration process
        to the applicable advertiser without providing you with another opportunity to
        review the information.</p>

        <p><strong>Ad Serving Companies</strong></p>

        <p>We may use third party ad networks or ad serving companies to serve
        advertisements on our websites. We pass information about you to these companies
        so that they can deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of
        interest to you. The information passed to these companies may include, but is
        not limited to, your IP address, e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone
        number, date of birth, gender, and any other information you provide to us. Web
        pages that are served by these companies will state that they are “powered
        by” or “ads by” the applicable company and will contain a link
        to that company’s privacy policy.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing Partners</strong></p>

        <p>We may share, license or sell your information to third parties for various
        marketing purposes, including their online (e.g., e-mail marketing) and offline
        (e.g., telemarketing, cell phone text messaging, skip tracing, and direct mail)
        marketing programs. With respect to telemarketing in particular, you authorize us
        and our third-party marketing partners to call your landline telephone and/or cell
        phone (if provided) and you understand that your wireless carrier's standard rates
        may apply to any calls to your cell phone.</p>

        <p><strong>Data Enhancement/Appending/Validation</strong></p>

        <p>We may use third party service providers to enhance our database with
        additional elements, including but not limited to age ranges present in your
        household, whether you own or rent a home, the length of time you have lived at
        your residence, whether you are a mail order buyer or responder, household
        income, and gender. Further, we may use third party service providers to append
        telephone numbers to other data points we have in our database. We also may use
        third party service providers to validate the data we have in our database.</p>

        <p>Additionally, we may share, license or sell your information to third parties
        for use in their data validation, enhancement, information verification services,

        agencies: (1) in response to their request; (2) when permitted or required by
        law; or (3) to establish our compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations,

        <p>We may store and share your information with third parties for suppression or

        <p>We also may share your information with third parties when: (1) trying to
        protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud or unauthorized
        transactions; (2) investigating fraud that has already taken place; (3) enforcing
        or applying existing terms and conditions and/or other agreements; (4) protecting

        responding to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, or to establish or
        exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>

        <p>In all cases, this information is not provided to these entities or persons
        for marketing purposes.</p>

        <p><strong>Right to Transfer</strong></p>

        <p>Should the Company choose to sell or transfer business assets, it is possible
        that the information we possess may be transferred as part of that transaction.
        The Company may decide to retain a copy of the information post sale or

        us with PII through any point of contact, <u><span style="color:blue;"><a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.GrandSavingsCenter.com/contact.cgi?config=7700','','scrollbars=yes,width=600,height=402'); return false;">click
