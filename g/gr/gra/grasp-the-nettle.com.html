<b>PRIVACY POLICY</b><br><br>Last Updated: July 28th, 
2009<br><br>Grasp-The-Nettle.com strives to offer its visitors the many 
advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized 
experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail 
address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy 
policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any 
unauthorized third party. Period."<br><br><b>How we gather information from 
users</b><br><br>How we collect and store information depends on the page you 
are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services 
provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register 
for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as 
newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you 
participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and 
other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, Grasp-The-Nettle.com 
also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools 
that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of 
your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and 
hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your 
user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information 
each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a 
particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional 
technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain 
cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting 
your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to 
access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name 
and password, and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features according 
to your preferences.<br><br><b>What we do with the information we 
collect</b><br><br>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance 
your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect 
your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.<br><br>Aggregated 
Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in 
many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns 
with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and 
services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most 
attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our 
advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any 
Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you 
individually.<br><br>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on 
Grasp-The-Nettle.com to communicate with you about your registration and 
customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and 
products offered by Grasp-The-Nettle.com and other topics we think you might 
find of interest.<br><br>Personally Identifiable Information collected by 
Grasp-The-Nettle.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not 
limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce 
transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other 
communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for 
the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such 
information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, 
from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, 
merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user 
information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your 
information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are 
reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of 
amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we 
deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice 
prior to disclosure in such cases.<br><br><b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and 
advertisements</b><br><br>Grasp-The-Nettle.com expects its partners, advertisers 
and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that 
third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content 
providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data 
collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site 
you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a Grasp-The-Nettle.com page, 
certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, 
through Grasp-The-Nettle.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access, 
information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other 
parties. Grasp-The-Nettle.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of 
such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those 
third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a 
third party.<br><br>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or 
other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify 
some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of 
our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable 
the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement 
before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated by 
third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. 
Grasp-The-Nettle.com does not control the use of this technology by third 
parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or 
policies of such third parties.<br><br>You should also be aware that if you 
voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in 
chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and 
used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited 
messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the 
control of Grasp-The-Nettle.com and this 
policy.<br><br><b>Children</b><br><br>Grasp-The-Nettle.com does not knowingly 
collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children 
under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any 
information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete 
that information immediately. If you believe Grasp-The-Nettle.com has any 
information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address 
listed below.<br><br>Contacting Us.<br><br>We can be reached by

Policy<br><br>Grasp-The-Nettle.com reserves the right to change this policy at 
any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of 
our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept 
those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will 
be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information 
was collected.<br>
