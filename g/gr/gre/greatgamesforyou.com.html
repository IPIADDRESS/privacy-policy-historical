Policy</span></b></p>

<p><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">Your
privacy is important to iWin. IWin operates various websites with game-related
products and services (our "Sites") and provides applications for the
provision of various online and mobile services, such as search and gaming (collectively,
"Applications") through which personal information may be collected.
This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") applies to all personal
information collected by iWin through our Sites and Applications.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">If
iWin is operating the Sites or Applications under an agreement with a specific
partner, the branding of the Site or the Application will indicate the specific
partner with which iWin operates the Site or Application ("Identified
Partners"). In such an event, iWin may share the data collected with that
particular identified Partner. Accordingly, iWin's use of your data is subject
to our Privacy Policy - and our Identified Partner's use of your data is
subject to its privacy policy. You should familiarize yourself with such
Identified Partner's privacy policy. Some of iWin's Identified Partners serve
their own ads or use other ad-serving networks. To opt out of data collection
by an Identified Partner's ad-serving network, please see that Identified
Partner's privacy policy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">This
Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding the information collected
online through Sites and Applications maintained by iWin, and not to websites
or services offered and operated by other companies or organizations to which
we link. Additionally, this Privacy Policy does not cover information that we
collect through other methods, such as mail-in sweepstakes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">IWin
is headquartered in the United States and the collected data is stored in the
United States. Although we operate Sites and maintain some operations outside
the United States, when you become a member of one of our online communities or
programs, make a purchase from iWin or register for one of the Applications,
your account is with a United States company and your data will be stored in
the United States. By registering and using this Site, Members acknowledge that
the processing of their personally identifying information for the purposes
described above may involve the transfer of such personally identifying
information from within the European Economic Area ("EEA") to
countries outside the EEA whose data protection regulation may not be as
stringent as that within the European Union.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">BY
USING THIS SITE, APPLICATION, OR USING ANY OF THE RELATED SERVICES, YOU SIGNIFY
YOUR ASSENT TO IWIN'S PRIVACY POLICY AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT IWIN MAY
PROCESS YOUR DATA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE
TO THE FOREGOING, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE OR APPLICATION OR IF ALREADY A
MEMBER YOU MUST TERMINATE YOUR ACCOUNT.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black">THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span></b></p>

<p><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">If
you are a visitor to a Site or a user of an Application, you may provide us
with two types of information: personal information you knowingly provide us
with on an individual basis ("Personal Information") and statistical
and usage information collected using cookies and other technologies as you
browse the Site or use an Application ("Usage Information").</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black">1. Personal Information</span></b></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">Registration
Information</span></b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black"><br>
You will need to provide us information about yourself, your firm or company,
and your preferences when you register on one of the Sites or for one of the
Applications. The specific information collected will vary depending on the
Site or Application, and may include your name, email address, username (or
player name), postal address, telephone number, birth date, and gender.
Registration is not required to browse any of our Sites, but you will not be
able to view certain content or use aspects of certain Sites or Applications
that require registration if you do not provide the requested information.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">Credit
Card Information</span></b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black"><br>
If you choose to purchase products or services from us or our partners, you may
need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition to
your name, postal address, email address, and telephone number. iWin securely transmits
Credit Card Information to our payment processor for verification and
processing. In some instances, iWin also securely stores your encrypted credit
card information.&nbsp; For all transactions, iWin employs secure servers and
the secure server software (SSL) to encrypt all payment information. In all
instances, iWin has made a substantial investment in server, database, backup,
and firewall technologies to protect the assets of the Site, including the
confidentiality of information collected about Members. These technologies are
deployed as part of a sophisticated security architecture and protocol.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">Email
Information</span></b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black"><br>
In addition to providing us with your email address as part of registration, if
you choose to correspond with us via email or by using a web interface to reach
customer support, we may retain the content of your messages together with your
email address and our responses.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black">2. Usage Information</span></b></p>

<p><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">Similar
to other commercial websites, we utilize standard technologies such as
"cookies," clear GIFs (also known as "web beacons" or
"action tags") and web server logs to collect information about how
the Sites and Applications are used. Additionally, when you connect to or
download an Application, we may retrieve information from the computer used to
log onto the Application. The information we collect may include technical
information about your computer, system and application software, and
peripherals, and any data related to the use and operation of the software used
in connection with the Application.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">Cookies</span></b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black"><br>
As an important and necessary part of providing customizable and personalized
services to our Members, iWin sites or its advertisers may use cookies, web
beacons, and similar technologies to store and sometimes track non-personal
information about Members while on the Website. A cookie is a small amount of
data that is sent to a Member's browser from a Web server and stored on a
Member's computer hard drive. Areas of iWin sites where Members are prompted to
log in or that are customizable require acceptance of cookies. These
technologies are also used to help iWin track the response to messages sent to
Members on the part of marketers so that iWin can monitor and report campaign
results to the marketer and track response history and campaign effectiveness.
In addition, banner advertisements are displayed on our websites which may
contain certain cookies. While iWin uses cookies in other parts of our websites,
the cookies received with banner ads are collected by our advertising partners,
and iWin does not have access to this information. Members may opt out of the
advertising that they see on our sites targeted specifically to them by going
to the respective sites' privacy policy(ies) and following directions. To opt
out of Google's "interest-based ads" and to learn more about Google's
collection of personal information to serve ads in connection with iWin, please
go to www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/. With respect to cookies, users have a
choice. By modifying their browser preferences, they have the choice to accept
all cookies; they will be unable to use those iWin services that require the
use of cookies in order to participate.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">Clear
GIFs</span></b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black"><br>
Clear GIFs are small, invisible graphic images (usually only one pixel) placed
on a web page or email message to capture statistical usage information. They
are not used to collect personal information about you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">IP
Addresses<br>
An IP address is a number assigned to your computer every time you are
connected to the internet. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web
server as part of demographic and profile data known as "traffic
data" so that appropriate data (such as the web pages you request) and
geographically relevant content can be sent to you.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;

<p><b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">Our
Advertisers</span></b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black"><br>
IWin's advertisers and advertising vendors display targeted advertisements.
Although we do not provide any personal information to the advertiser or
advertising vendor, by interacting with or clicking on an ad you acknowledge
the possibility that the advertiser may assume you meet the targeting criteria
used.<br>
In addition to cookies placed by iWin or its agents as described above,
advertisers and advertising vendors that serve ads onto our Sites may use their
own cookies or other tracking technologies. We cannot be responsible for the
privacy policies or practices of any such advertisers and vendors.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black">HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION</span></b></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">Uses
of your Personal Information</span></b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black"><br>
IWin will use your information primarily to provide you with our products and
services and to receive payment from you. In order to do this, we may determine
whether you meet the minimum system requirements to use our products. We may
also ask you to participate in surveys about products, services, news, and
events; we may offer you product upgrades and games for you to purchase. You
may opt out of some of these uses.<br>
IWin may also provide Personal Information to companies we engage as
contractors or agents to perform services for us, such as maintaining software,

is the information held?</span></b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black"><br>
We are a global organization and the computer systems on which we collect,
store, and use the information collected or received are based in the United
States and elsewhere. Your personal information may be transferred to , used,

IWin does not use your Personal Information for the purposes incompatible with
those listed above. Other than as provided in this Privacy Policy, iWin does
not provide your Personal information to third parties unless you specifically
consent to provide such information to a third party. Sometimes, certain
indirectly identifiable information needs to be communicated with third-party
vendors, for example, to process an order you have made. We may also disclose
Personal Information when legally compelled to do so. In other words, when the
law requires it or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure is
necessary or appropriate to address potential or actual injury or interference
with the rights, property, or operations or iWin, our users or others. Finally,
if we undergo a merger or acquisition, or sell or otherwise transfer
substantially all the assets of iWin, or relating to any website that we own or
operate or any product or service that we offer, Personal Information may be
transferred to our successor or assign.</span></p>

this type of communication only if we have received your permission to do so.</span></p>

Does IWin Protect Your Information and Secure Information Transmissions?</span></b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black"><br>
We use industry standard technology and services to protect and secure your

requests your private information beyond the purposes of user identification
for support. In general, we request that you do not send private information to
us by email. Please contact iWin support if you have any questions or concerns.</span></p>

Online Privacy Protection</span></b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black"><br>
The safety of children is important to us. IWin's websites are for a general
audience that is not directed to children under the age of 18. Similarly,
iWin's services are not directed to or intended for anyone under the age of 18.
IWin will not knowingly accept members who are under the age of 18 years nor
will it knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from
or about anyone under the age of 18 years. IWin relies on the truthfulness of
the registration when accepting new Members. In the event that iWin receives
information that establishes that a Member is under the age of 18 years, iWin
reserves the right, but not the obligation, to terminate that Member's
membership or take other steps that it determines are appropriate in the circumstances,
such as providing parental notification. IWin may also delete all information
in our databases about that terminated Member.</span></p>

Access, Training, and Expectations</span></b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black"><br>
Our corporate values, ethical standards, and practices are committed to the appropriate
protection of customer and visitor information. In general, our business
practices limit employee access to confidential information, and limit the use
and disclosure of such information to authorized persons, processes, and
transactions. This obligation continues once an employee has left our company.</span></p>

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from
our Sites or accessed through our Applications, nor the information or content
contained in any search results or third-party websites. Often links to other
websites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be
of interest to the users of our Sites and Applications. Please remember that
when you use a link to go from a Site to another website, our Privacy Policy is
no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website,
including websites which have a link on one of our Sites, is subject to that
website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies
before proceeding.</span></p>

IWin reserves the right to change or update this Privacy Policy at any time by
positing a notice that we are changing this Privacy Policy. If there is a
change to this Privacy Policy, we will post the change on the Site or with the
Application to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it,
and under what circumstances we may disclose it. You will be deemed to have
accepted such change if you continue to use the Site or Application after the
new policy has been posted. In the event that this document conflicts in any
way with the User Agreement, the User Agreement shall take precedence over the
