  <h4>Privacy and Online Data Collection Notice</h4>
  <p>*Effective November 8, 2006</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Our Commitment to Privacy</strong>
    <br>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we (Like.com) provide this notice explaining our online information practices associated with our web site, Like.com (the "Web Site"), and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy is considered to be a part of Like.com's <a href="/terms.py"> User Agreement</a>. By using the Web Site you agree to the terms and conditions of the User Agreement, including this Privacy Policy. By using the Web Site, you are also consenting to our privacy practices, including the use and disclosure of any personally identifiable information that you have shared with us, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Minor's Privacy</strong>
    <br>The Sites are not targeted towards, or intended for use by anyone under the age of 18. By using Like.com you represent and warrant that you are 18 years of age or older, or are using the site under supervision of a parent or guardian. We reserve the right to terminate your membership in the event that we become aware you are under 18 and without appropriate supervision. Persons under 18 may not submit any personally identifiable information to us, and if we discover that we have inadvertently gathered such information, we will take the appropriate steps to delete it.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>The Information We Collect</strong>
    <br>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Web Site.</p>
  <ul class="footer">
  <li>Registration. From time to time, we may offer services that require user registration, through which we will collect user information such as 
    <strong>User id, Password, E-mail address, Physical address, Birth date, Name (first and last), etc.</strong>
  </li><li>Email Newsletter If a user wishes to subscribe to the Like.com newsletter we ask for contact and delivery information such as name and email address. Our newsletter provides an unsubscribe link with each broadcast. We will never sell your name to a third party under any circumstances.
  </li><li>User Content. Users may choose to add content to the site. In some cases, User Content may include a user ID and email link that is accessible to all site visitors.
  </li><li>Contact Us Form. Users, particularly prospective partner merchants may elect to fill and submit contact forms which will be forwarded to the appropriate department (sales, customer service, Web ops) for disposition.
  </li><li>General site use information. As with all websites, certain types of general information about your use is collected by our server, including but not limited to the number of times you have visited the Web Site, your IP address, cookies, pages you viewed, etc.
  </li><li>Other people. On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, you might enter information regarding your friends and contacts into your Web Site address book. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected may include names, emails and other descriptive content that you add.
  </li></ul>
  <p>
    <strong>The Way We Use Information</strong>
    <br>We use the information you provide about yourself and others only to assist you in using our service (searching photos and merchant products, etc.). We do not share this information with outside parties.</p>
  <p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.</p>
  <p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design the Web Site and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on the Web Site, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those specific individuals.</p>
  <p>We will allow third party advertisers to display targeted advertising information to users of the Web Site. We will not sell and/or give your personally identifiable information to such advertisers, but these advertisers may analyze the keywords and other information you and others have publicly provided in the display of your photos and show ads targeted to such information.</p>
  <p>Like any website, we may legally be required to disclose personally identifiable information about you in special circumstances, for instance in response to legal actions, subpoenas, court orders, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, etc.</p>
  <p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Our Commitment to Data Security</strong>
    <br>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>
  <p>
