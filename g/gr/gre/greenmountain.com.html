			Privacy Policy<br><br>
<div id="body_text">
At Green Mountain Energy Company, we are committed to protecting your privacy as a visitor to our web site, as an applicant for service or as a customer. The following disclosures describe our privacy practices applicable to the information of our individual customers, applicants for service and visitors. This disclosure statement takes the place of all previous notices or statements of Green Mountain involving privacy and use of consumer information and is subject to change at any time. <br><br>

<span id="subhead">Collection of Information </span><br>
We collect, retain, and use personally identifiable information about you when we reasonably believe that it will help us in the conduct of our business or our provision of products, services, and other opportunities to you. For example, we use your information to protect and administer records, accounts, and funds; to comply with certain laws and regulations; to help us design and improve our products and services; and to understand your needs so we can provide you with quality products and services. <br><br>

We collect personally identifiable information voluntarily provided by you, such as when you sign up for one of our products, request further information, or send us an e-mail. This information may include your name, postal/service address, social security number, telephone number, e-mail address, account number, credit card number or bank account information, as well as the content of the request. We use this information to respond to your request, to provide products and services to you, and to contact you about other products, services or events that we promote ourselves or together with others and that might be of interest to you. If you do not want us to contact you about other products, services, or events, please send us a request by e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@greenmountain.com">support@greenmountain.com</a> and we will not use your personal information for this purpose.<br><br>

Information about you is also collected from several other sources, such as: <br><br>
<ul><li style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left:24px">Information about your transactions and experiences with us (for example: account balances, account activity and usage, and payment history); </li><br><br>
<li style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left:24px">Information we receive from consumer reporting agencies and other outside sources (for example: creditworthiness, credit history, and employment verification); and </li><br><br>
<li style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left:24px">Information we gather at your request or with your consent from third parties (for example: to assist us with servicing your account(s), providing special services to you, or preparing offers for other products). </li></ul>
<p><br>
  
  <span id="subhead">Our Information-Sharing Practices with Outside Parties </span><br>
  We may disclose personally identifiable information we collect to non-affiliated third parties as permitted by law. For example, we may disclose personally identifiable information about you to credit reporting agencies, in response to a subpoena or court order, as required by certain federal and state laws, to help complete a transaction initiated by you, to implement our terms of service, and pursuant to your request or authorization. <br><br>
  
  We also may disclose personally identifiable information we collect to companies that perform services or functions on our behalf â such as bill and account processing, marketing services, and consulting services â and to other companies with which we have joint marketing agreements. Joint marketing agreements with other companies allow us to bring information to you about products and services that are different from those we provide. We require our service providers and those with which we jointly market products or services to adhere to confidentiality standards governing the privacy of your information. These companies may use and disclose the information we provide to them only for the purposes for which it is provided or as otherwise permitted by law. <br><br>
  
  We will not sell or exchange personally identifiable information about you with outside marketers or other companies to allow them to independently solicit you for their products or services without giving you the opportunity to decline to have your personally identifiable information provided to such outside marketers or other companies. <br><br>
  
  We may also use personal information on an aggregated basis (so that individual information is not known) to understand how to improve our products and services. 
  You have a right to review the personally identifiable information we have gathered and to identify any inaccurate information we have on file. If you would like to review this information, please send us a request by e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@greenmountain.com">support@greenmountain.com</a>. <br><br>
  
  <span id="subhead">Security of Your Information </span><br>
  Our commitment to the privacy of your information includes maintaining the security of your information. We use physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access to or use of personally identifiable customer information. Your information is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. We require our employees and data processors to respect the confidentiality of any personally identifiable information held by us. Unfortunately, no data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot give an absolute assurance that the information you provide to us will be secure at all times. Green Mountain will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information. <br><br>
  
  We maintain internal procedures to restrict access to personally identifiable information to those employees who need to know that information to perform their duties, such as administering your accounts or providing products and services to you. All of our employees are governed by confidentiality agreements and standards of conduct that include strict standards for keeping your personally identifiable information confidential. <br><br>
  
  We will retain personally identifiable information for a time period consistent with the duration of our business relationship and with applicable laws and financial reporting requirements. Disposal of personally identifiable information will be made as permitted by applicable law and in a manner intended to protect the privacy of such information. <br><br>
  
  <span id="subhead">Third-Party Vendors </span><br>
  Green Mountain works with a number of third-party vendors that provide services to us and that help us provide products and services to our customers. In some instances, we may offer our products and services, or other products and services, through a third-party web site (which may be linked to from or accessed through our web site). While our agreements with these vendors include confidentiality and other provisions intended to protect your personally identifiable information, we do not own these third-parties and do not have direct control over their handling and use of information you may provide to them. Therefore, please refer to the specific online privacy and security policies of third-parties when accessing their sites. <br><br>
  
  <span id="subhead">Off-Site Links </span><br>
  As a reference and service to you, Green Mountain may provide links to other web sites on the Internet. These links are provided for your convenience and do not constitute an endorsement. These sites will have their own privacy policies that may differ from ours, so you should also refer to that specific site's privacy and security policies when accessing other sites. We are not responsible for the content of or privacy practices employed by other sites. <br><br>
  
  <span id="subhead">Children's On-Line Privacy </span><br>
  We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from our web sites about children under the age of 13. <br><br>
  
  <span id="subhead">Viruses </span><br>
  We use appropriate commercially available anti-virus software to ensure that this web site does not contain or carry viruses. However, due to the rapidly developing nature of viruses and the Internet we strongly recommend that you employ similar anti-virus software when accessing the Green Mountain web site or any web site. We make no warranty that this web site or e-mail correspondence is free from viruses. <br><br>
  
  <span id="subhead">Cookies and Other Information </span><br>
  We acquire information concerning usage of our web site through two sources: cookies and information voluntarily provided by you. <br><br>
  Our web server tracks and collects general information about visits to our site through the use of "cookies." Cookies monitor which areas of our site are highly visited and which are not, allowing us to give you a better web site by letting us track what is useful to you and what is not. Based on this information, we can improve the site, provide you with tailored information, and save your preferences while you're at our site. Cookies are used at many major web sites, and do not give us access to any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, postal/service address, e-mail address, social security number, credit card number or account number. We do not provide cookie information to any third party other than companies helping us to improve our web site. If you are uncomfortable with our use of cookie technology, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. <br><br>
  
  We also use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. These cookies are placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.  For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy" target="_blank">www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy</a>.<br><br>
  
  Our privacy policy is subject to change. In the event of any change, the updated privacy policy will be posted on our web site. We will continue to post this policy so that you can know what information we gather and how it is used. Please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:support@greenmountain.com">support@greenmountain.com</a> or call us at 1-888-246-6730. <br><br>
