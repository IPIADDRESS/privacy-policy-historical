Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you use GreatApps.com.  
<br><br>
<strong>Overview</strong>
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy (hereinafter “Policy”) governs your use of GreatApps.com and describes the information we collect from you and what may happen to that information.  For example, this Policy will let you know what information we collect from you; what cookies are and how they are used; how your information is used; who is collecting your information; with whom your information may be shared; what options are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information; how you may use other users’ information ("Users"); the types of security precautions in place to protect against loss, misuse, or alteration of your information; how we protect children’s privacy; and what else you should know about your online privacy.

We ask that you bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version of our Privacy Policy.

<br><br>
<strong>What Personally Identifiable Information does GreatApps.com collect?</strong>
<br><br>
The primary purpose of collecting information from you is to allow you to create an account with us so that you can take advantage of all of the tools and features provided on the Site and to provide you with a personalized experience.  We will only collect information about you that we consider necessary to achieve this purpose.

Some information is gathered when you register so that you may receive notifications regarding new apps posted to the Site.  This includes your name, your email, and a self-selected password.  Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional.  Please note that registration is NOT required to view the Site but is required to access all of the features and tools of the Site.  It's your decision whether you want to share personally identifiable information with us.

<br><br>
<strong>What are IP Addresses and how does GreatApps.com use them?</strong>
<br><br>
When your web browser requests a web page from another computer on the Internet, such as GreatApps.com, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information. This is called your computer's "IP address." (IP stands for "Internet protocol.") For many users accessing the Internet, the IP address will be different every time you log on.  We record the IP Addresses that access GreatApps.com along with related information such as your browser type and operating system. This information helps us, in part, learn about the geographical distribution of our website visitors and the technology they use to access our site so that we can improve our Site.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Data collection devices, such as “cookies,” are used to store, and sometimes track, information about you.  Generally, these cookies help provide personalized services and promote trust and safety.  A cookie is a small file containing a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and placed on your computer’s hard drive to assist us in providing our services.  All pages on the Site where you are prompted to login or that are customizable request that you accept cookies.  Cookies are only read by the server that placed them and are unable to execute any code or virus.  Most cookies are “session cookies,” and are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.  
<br><br>
More specifically, we use cookies to remind us of who you are and to access your registration information in order to deliver to you a more personalized service.  This cookie is set when you register or “Log In” and is modified when you “Log Out” of our services.  We also may use cookies to measure your visiting patterns in the aggregate.

We understand that your privacy is important.  Generally, GreatApps.com will not disclose your personally identifiable information unless we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as those described below.
<br><br>
When the Law Requires it:  If we receive a subpoena, court order, or other legal process that requires that we disclose information about a User, we have no choice but to comply with it and will disclose the required information.  
<br><br>
Third Party Data &amp; Data in the Aggregate: Aggregate data (data gathered across all user accounts) may be gathered in a non-personally identifiable form to build higher quality, more useful online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas and services of the Site.  Aggregate data may be disclosed in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes.  However, no personal information that could be used to identify you personally is disclosed in these situations.  
<br><br>
External Service Providers: Separate services are offered by third parties, also known as external service providers, some of whom advertise on the Site.  If you choose to use these services, disclose information to these parties, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, their privacy policy governs the use of your information.  We will not disclose your personal information to external service providers without your express consent.  
<br><br>
Business Transaction: GreatApps.com reserves the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from visitors, or that we otherwise collect concerning or in connection with the Site, to a third party in the event of a sale or other transfer of assets or of any portion of our business. In the event GreatApps.com enters a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information may be among the assets transferred.  
<br><br>
Other:  We may disclose account information where we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating GreatApps.com’s Terms of Service Agreement or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) GreatApps.com’s rights or property, other Site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

<br><br>
We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Policy.  For example, as stated above, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site.  We use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, however, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
<br><br>
<strong>What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?</strong>
<br><br>
You do not have to disclose personally identifiable information to view the Site.  If you choose to register on the Site, you will need to disclose certain information as specified above.  GreatApps.com will send you email upon registration with the Site.  GreatApps.com may also send you email from time to time.

<br><br>
<strong>How may I use other users’ information?</strong>
<br><br>
User contact information, such as email address, is not generally disclosed on the Site to other Users.  However, in the event that you obtain the contact information of a User or Users of Site, you agree that you not use such information for any purpose.  Further, recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all applicable local laws and rules regarding online conduct and privacy, as well as content.  Specifically, but not as a limitation, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding transmission of technical and personal data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.
<br><br>
Finally, we do not tolerate spam.  You are not licensed to add us, or a GreatApps.com User, even one who contacted you, to your mail (email or physical mail) list without the express, written consent of that User.
<br><br>
<strong>What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?</strong>
<br><br>
Your GreatApps.com registration information is password protected so that only you have access to this personal information.  We recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone.  GreatApps.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or unsolicited email.  If you choose to share your email address (which is used as your log-in name) and password or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party’s privacy policy.  If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.  Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.
<br><br>
Whenever GreatApps.com handles your personal information, we take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the relevant Terms of Service Agreement and this Policy.  We use procedural and mechanical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy.  Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  We cannot, therefore, warrant or ensure the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.  Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
