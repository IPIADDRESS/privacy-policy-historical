  <p align="left"><strong>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</strong> <br>
    We   are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only   have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via   email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this   information to anyone. </p>

  <p align="left"><strong>Your Access to and Control Over Information</strong> <br>
    You   may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the   following at any time by contacting us via the email address or phone   number given on our website: </p>
