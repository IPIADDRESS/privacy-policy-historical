<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div> Greenpeace believes you have a fundamental right to privacy on the web,   and we work to protect your security online as vigorously as possible. </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>This policy applies to all the pages hosted on greenpeace.in. It   does  not apply to pages hosted by other organisations to which we may   link  and whose privacy policies may differ.</p>
      <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information on our web site    unless you voluntarily choose to give it to us via this website,   email,  a phone call, by signing up as a supporter, or by postal mail.   Even  when you choose to give us information, we keep it confidential,   and we  bind suppliers who work with us by these conditions as well.</p>
      <p>We do not sell or rent web-generated mailing lists or other personally identifiable information outside Greenpeace.</p>
      <p>Greenpeace does not share or otherwise disclose its files to other    organisations. However we may share files amongst national or regional    Greenpeace offices to effectively inform and activate the public to win    campaigns and help raise money to fund our activities.</p>
      <p>We do not provide mailing lists to outside agencies.</p>
      <p>When you sign a petition or other form on the website you will be    added as a cyber-activist and we will send you updates on this and other    important campaigns by email. If at any time you would like to    unsubscribe from our email list, you may do so by clicking on the    unsubscribe link in our mails.</p>
      <p>We maintain some records of individuals who contact us for further    information or help in case we need to contact them later or provide    further information to them in the future. However, we do not provide    this information to anyone else unless you give us your permission, and    we do not use this information for other purposes.</p>
      <p>Our site is hosted on a variety of servers. Information collected for    fundraising purposes is collected on a server we own and maintain in a    secure environment. Information in our website logs is not personally    identifiable, and we make no attempt to link that information with the    individuals that actually browse the site. The server collects    information about the date and time in which our web site was accessed    and the Internet address of the server from which you linked to our    site. We may also track, anonymously, a user’s movement within the site.    We use this data to improve our site performance and to evaluate    traffic statistics, such as the times of day and days of week at which    we see peak traffic, and to assess the relative popularity of different    areas of the site.</p>
      <p>A cookie is a tiny element of data that our site can send to your    browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive. Our web site uses    cookies to customise certain options. This small amount of information    does NOT contain any private information stored on your computer. You    may set your web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, or to    disable cookies altogether. We do not use cookies to track your content    choices.</p>
      <p>Our Donation form page uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): a security    protocol that provides communications privacy over the Internet. The    protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that    is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. It    encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card   number,  name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information   travels  over the Internet. While on a secure page, such as our giving   form, the  lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Firefox,   Opera,  Netscape Navigator, and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes   locked, as  opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ’surfing’.</p>
      <p>You can learn more about SSL at:</p>
      <p>http://home.netscape.com/security/techbriefs/ssl.html</p>
      <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online,    we also do everything in our power to protect user-information   off-line.  All of your information, not just the sensitive information   like a  credit card number, is restricted. Only employees who need the    information to perform a specific job (for example, our donation    officers) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our    employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave    their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to    re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, all Greenpeace    employees who handle membership information are kept up-to-date on our    security and privacy practices. Our employees are notified and reminded    about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to   ensure  our supporters’ information is protected.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions about the information we maintain about    your supporter details please contact web.producer.in@greenpeace.org</p>
      <p>By signing up as a cyberactivist or donor, you accept this privacy    policy and authorize Greenpeace to collect, store and process your    information in the ways mentioned above and for the purposes you    submitted it.</p>
