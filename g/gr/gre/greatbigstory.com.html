Cookies and Other User and Ad-Targeting Technologies.**\r\n\r\nWe use cookies and other technologies both to provide our Services to\r\nyou and to advertise to you. We also may work with Partners to help them\r\nadvertise to you when you visit other websites or mobile applications,\r\nand to help them perform user analytics. These technologies may also be\r\nused to analyze how our Users interact with advertising on our Services\r\nand elsewhere, and more generally, to learn more about our Users and\r\nwhat services or offers you might prefer to receive. We describe some of\r\nthese technologies below.\r\n\r\n1\\. Cookies. To enhance your online experience, we and our Partners use\r\n\&quot;cookies\&quot;, \&quot;web beacons\&quot; or other tracking technologies. Cookies are\r\ntext files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences.\r\nWe use cookies or other tracking technologies to understand Service and\r\nInternet usage and to improve or customize the products, content,\r\nofferings, services or advertisements on our Services. For example, we\r\nmay use cookies to personalize your experience at our Services (e.g., to\r\nrecognize you by name when you return to a Service), save your password\r\nin password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our\r\nServices. We also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to help\r\nus offer you products, content, offerings or services that may be of\r\ninterest to you and to deliver relevant advertising when you visit this\r\nService, a Turner Affiliate's Service, or when you visit other websites\r\nor applications. We or a third party platform with whom we work may\r\nplace or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to\r\nreceive customized content, offers, services or advertisements on our\r\nServices or other sites. These cookies contain no information intended\r\nto identify you personally. The cookies may be associated with\r\nde-identified demographic or other data linked to or derived from data\r\nyou voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we\r\nmay share with a service provider solely in hashed, non-human readable\r\nform.\r\n\r\nWe, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks\r\nand platforms, agencies, or our Partners also may use cookies or other\r\ntracking technologies to manage and measure the performance of\r\nadvertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Turner\r\nNetwork and/or other networks or Services. This also helps us, our\r\nservice providers and Partners provide more relevant advertising.\r\n\r\n2\\. Syncing Cookies and Identifiers. We may work with our Partners (for\r\ninstance, third party ad platforms) to synchronize unique, anonymous\r\nidentifiers (such as those associated with cookies) in order to match\r\nour Partners' uniquely coded user identifiers to our own. We may do\r\nthis, for instance, to enhance data points about a particular unique\r\nbrowser or device, and thus enable us or others to send ads that are\r\nmore relevant, match Users to their likely product interests, or better\r\nsynchronize, cap, or optimize advertising.\r\n\r\n3\\. Locally Stored Objects. Services on the Turner Network may employ\r\nlocally stored objects (\&quot;LSOs\&quot;) and other client side storage tracking\r\ntechnologies in certain situations where they help to provide a better\r\nuser experience, such as to remember settings, preferences and usage\r\nsimilar to browser cookies, or in order to target or help our Partners\r\ntarget ads, analyze ad performance, or perform user, website or market\r\nanalytics. For LSOs utilized by Adobe Flash you can access Flash\r\nmanagement tools from [*Adobe's\r\nwebsite*](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).\r\nIn addition, some, but not all browsers, provide the ability to remove\r\nLSOs, sometimes within cookie and privacy settings.\r\n\r\n4\\. Disabling Cookies\r\n\r\nMost web browsers are set up to accept cookies. You may be able to set\r\nyour browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse\r\ncertain cookies. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web\r\nbrowser, some features of the Services may be difficult to use or\r\ninoperable.\r\n\r\nWe may work with certain third-party companies that use techniques other\r\nthan HTTP cookies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect\r\nand record information about your web surfing activity, including those\r\nintegrated with our Services. Please keep in mind that your web browser\r\nmay not permit you to block the use of these techniques, and those\r\nbrowser settings that block conventional cookies may have no effect on\r\nsuch techniques. To learn more about Interest-Based Advertising or to\r\nopt-out of this type of advertising by those third parties that are\r\nmembers of DAA's opt-out program, please go to\r\n[*http://www.aboutads.info*](http://www.aboutads.info).\r\n\r\n5\\. Web Beacons. We and our Partners may also use \&quot;web beacons\&quot; or clear\r\nGIFs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on\r\na Service or in an email, to monitor the behavior and collect data about\r\nthe visitors viewing a Service or email. For example, web beacons may be\r\nused to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to\r\nthe browser of a visitor viewing that Service. Web beacons may also be\r\nused to provide information on the effectiveness of our email campaigns\r\n(e.g., open rates, clicks, forwards, etc.).\r\n\r\n6\\. Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs.\r\n\r\nWe also sometimes use, or partner with publishers, publisher-facing, or\r\napp developer platforms that use mobile Software Development Kits\r\n(\&quot;SDKs\&quot;), or use an SDK with a mobile app that we offer, to collect\r\nInformation, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android\r\nAdvertising IDs), and Information connected to how mobile devices\r\ninteract with our Services and those using our Services. A mobile SDK is\r\nthe mobile app version of a web beacon (see \&quot;Web Beacons\&quot; above). The\r\nSDK is a bit of computer code that app developers can include in their\r\napps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related\r\nservices or analytics to be performed. We may use this technology to\r\ndeliver or help our Partners deliver certain advertising through mobile\r\napplications and browsers based on information associated with your\r\nmobile device. If you'd like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you\r\nin this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in the\r\n\&quot;Your Ad Choices\&quot; section below.\r\n\r\nBy visiting the Service, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you\r\nacknowledge, and agree that you are giving us your consent to track your\r\nactivities and your use of the Service through the technologies\r\ndescribed above, as well as similar technologies developed in the\r\nfuture, and that we may use such tracking technologies in the emails we\r\nsend to you.\r\n\r\nOur unaffiliated Partners and third parties may themselves set and\r\naccess their own tracking technologies when you visit our Services and\r\nthey may have access to information about you and your online activities\r\nover time and across different websites or applications when you use the\r\nService. Their use of such tracking technologies is not in our control\r\nand is subject to their own privacy policies.\r\n\r\n**V. Your Ad Choices**\r\n\r\nAdvertising enables us to provide the rich content for which Services on\r\nthe Turner Network are known, and to provide much of this content free\r\nof cost to our Users. Thus, we strive to provide you with ads that are\r\nrelevant to you and for products you may want.\r\n\r\nHowever, we also offer you choices with regard to interest-based ads.\r\n\r\n\u003ca href=\&quot;javascript:(function(){var s=document.createElement('script');s.src='//preferences.truste.com/webservices/js?domain=turner.com\u0026type=turner\u0026js=responsive';s.onreadystatechange=function(){if(this.readyState=='loaded'||this.readyState=='complete'){view(trusteId);}};s.onload=function(){view(trusteId);};document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(s);})()\&quot;\u003e*To learn more about interest-based ads and the choices available to\r\nyou, please visit our Ad Choices page, which has general information\r\nabout certain companies that place these\r\nads.*\u003c/a\u003e\r\n\r\nYou may also find more information about entities involved in online\r\nadvertising and additional choices you may make through the Network\r\nAdvertising Initiative (\&quot;NAI\&quot;) at the [*NAI\r\nService*](http://www.networkadvertising.org/), and the [*Digital\r\nAdvertising Alliance*](http://www.aboutads.info) (the \&quot;DAA\&quot;) at the\r\n[*DAA consumer choice Service*](http://www.aboutads.info).

certain of the Information with a unique identifier that then associates
the Information with your device or browser.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.greatbigstory.com/privacy#turner_cookies"><em>For information about how these technologies work and how we may use
them, please go to Section IV, titled Cookies, And Other User And

Information about you (such as your name, screen name or location).
Likewise, if you register and create a profile with our Service, the

<p><strong>III. Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong></p>

<p>3. With third parties in order to investigate, prevent, or take action
(in our sole discretion) regarding potentially illegal activities,
suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to any person,
us, or the Services, or violations of our policies, the law or our
<a href="http://www.greatbigstory.com/terms"><em>Terms of Use</em></a>, to verify or enforce
compliance with the policies governing our Services.</p>

<p>4. We may transfer some or all of your Information if we, or one of our
business units, undergoes a business transition, like a merger,
acquisition by another company, or sale of all or part of our assets, or
if a substantial portion of our or of a business unit's assets is sold
or merged in this way.</p>

<p>5. We may share the Information with Turner Affiliates, so they can
provide, improve and communicate with you about their own, or their
marketing partners' products and services.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.greatbigstory.com/privacy#turner_affiliates"><em>A representative list of Turner Affiliates is available
here.</em></a></p>

<p>6. We may share the Information with unaffiliated Partners and third
parties (e.g., our third party service providers, advertisers,
advertising networks and platforms, agencies, other marketers, magazine
publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit
organizations) that wish to market products or services to you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.greatbigstory.com/privacy#turner_optout"><em>If you wish to opt out from such sharing please visit the How to

<p><a id="turner_cookies"></a></p>

<p><strong>IV. Cookies and Other User and Ad-Targeting Technologies.</strong></p>

<p>We use cookies and other technologies both to provide our Services to
you and to advertise to you. We also may work with Partners to help them
advertise to you when you visit other websites or mobile applications,
and to help them perform user analytics. These technologies may also be
used to analyze how our Users interact with advertising on our Services
and elsewhere, and more generally, to learn more about our Users and
what services or offers you might prefer to receive. We describe some of
these technologies below.</p>

<p>1. Cookies. To enhance your online experience, we and our Partners use
"cookies", "web beacons" or other tracking technologies. Cookies are
text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences.
We use cookies or other tracking technologies to understand Service and
Internet usage and to improve or customize the products, content,
offerings, services or advertisements on our Services. For example, we
may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Services (e.g., to
recognize you by name when you return to a Service), save your password
in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our
Services. We also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to help
us offer you products, content, offerings or services that may be of
interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising when you visit this
Service, a Turner Affiliate's Service, or when you visit other websites
or applications. We or a third party platform with whom we work may
place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to
receive customized content, offers, services or advertisements on our
Services or other sites. These cookies contain no information intended
to identify you personally. The cookies may be associated with
de-identified demographic or other data linked to or derived from data
you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we
may share with a service provider solely in hashed, non-human readable
form.</p>

<p>We, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks
and platforms, agencies, or our Partners also may use cookies or other
tracking technologies to manage and measure the performance of
advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Turner
Network and/or other networks or Services. This also helps us, our
service providers and Partners provide more relevant advertising.</p>

<p>2. Syncing Cookies and Identifiers. We may work with our Partners (for
instance, third party ad platforms) to synchronize unique, anonymous
identifiers (such as those associated with cookies) in order to match
our Partners' uniquely coded user identifiers to our own. We may do
this, for instance, to enhance data points about a particular unique
browser or device, and thus enable us or others to send ads that are
more relevant, match Users to their likely product interests, or better
synchronize, cap, or optimize advertising.</p>

<p>3. Locally Stored Objects. Services on the Turner Network may employ
locally stored objects ("LSOs") and other client side storage tracking
technologies in certain situations where they help to provide a better
user experience, such as to remember settings, preferences and usage
similar to browser cookies, or in order to target or help our Partners
target ads, analyze ad performance, or perform user, website or market
analytics. For LSOs utilized by Adobe Flash you can access Flash
management tools from <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html"><em>Adobe's
website</em></a>.
In addition, some, but not all browsers, provide the ability to remove
LSOs, sometimes within cookie and privacy settings.</p>

<p>4. Disabling Cookies</p>

<p>Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies. You may be able to set
your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse
certain cookies. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web
browser, some features of the Services may be difficult to use or
inoperable.</p>

<p>We may work with certain third-party companies that use techniques other
than HTTP cookies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect
and record information about your web surfing activity, including those
integrated with our Services. Please keep in mind that your web browser
may not permit you to block the use of these techniques, and those
browser settings that block conventional cookies may have no effect on
such techniques. To learn more about Interest-Based Advertising or to
opt-out of this type of advertising by those third parties that are
members of DAA's opt-out program, please go to
<a href="http://www.aboutads.info"><em>http://www.aboutads.info</em></a>.</p>

<p>5. Web Beacons. We and our Partners may also use "web beacons" or clear
GIFs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on
a Service or in an email, to monitor the behavior and collect data about
the visitors viewing a Service or email. For example, web beacons may be
used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to
the browser of a visitor viewing that Service. Web beacons may also be
used to provide information on the effectiveness of our email campaigns
(e.g., open rates, clicks, forwards, etc.).</p>

<p>6. Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs.</p>

<p>We also sometimes use, or partner with publishers, publisher-facing, or
app developer platforms that use mobile Software Development Kits
("SDKs"), or use an SDK with a mobile app that we offer, to collect
Information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android
Advertising IDs), and Information connected to how mobile devices
interact with our Services and those using our Services. A mobile SDK is
the mobile app version of a web beacon (see "Web Beacons" above). The
SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers can include in their
apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related
services or analytics to be performed. We may use this technology to
deliver or help our Partners deliver certain advertising through mobile
applications and browsers based on information associated with your
mobile device. If you'd like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you
in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in the
"Your Ad Choices" section below.</p>

<p>By visiting the Service, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you
acknowledge, and agree that you are giving us your consent to track your
activities and your use of the Service through the technologies
described above, as well as similar technologies developed in the
future, and that we may use such tracking technologies in the emails we
send to you.</p>

<p>Our unaffiliated Partners and third parties may themselves set and
access their own tracking technologies when you visit our Services and
they may have access to information about you and your online activities
over time and across different websites or applications when you use the
Service. Their use of such tracking technologies is not in our control
and is subject to their own privacy policies.</p>

<p><strong>V. Your Ad Choices</strong></p>

<p>Advertising enables us to provide the rich content for which Services on
the Turner Network are known, and to provide much of this content free
of cost to our Users. Thus, we strive to provide you with ads that are
relevant to you and for products you may want.</p>

<p>However, we also offer you choices with regard to interest-based ads.</p>

<p><a href="javascript:(function(){var s=document.createElement('script');s.src='//preferences.truste.com/webservices/js?domain=turner.com&amp;type=turner&amp;js=responsive';s.onreadystatechange=function(){if(this.readyState=='loaded'||this.readyState=='complete'){view(trusteId);}};s.onload=function(){view(trusteId);};document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(s);})()"><em>To learn more about interest-based ads and the choices available to
you, please visit our Ad Choices page, which has general information
about certain companies that place these
ads.</em></a></p>

<p>You may also find more information about entities involved in online
advertising and additional choices you may make through the Network
Advertising Initiative ("NAI") at the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/"><em>NAI
Service</em></a>, and the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info"><em>Digital
Advertising Alliance</em></a> (the "DAA") at the
<a href="http://www.aboutads.info"><em>DAA consumer choice Service</em></a>. Turner is a
participant in the online industry's self-regulatory program
administered by the DAA and has agreed to adhere to the DAA's principles
applicable to interest-based ads.</p>

<p>The tools provided on the Ad Choices page, as well as the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices"><em>DAA opt-out
page</em></a> and the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp"><em>NAI opt-out
page</em></a> are
provided by third parties, not Turner. Turner does not control or
operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide
through these tools.</p>

<p><a id="adchoices"></a></p>

<p>When using a mobile application you may receive tailored in-application
advertisements. Depending on your device, you may be able to reset your
mobile device's advertising identifier at any time by accessing the
privacy settings on your mobile device. In addition, each operating
system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows
for Microsoft devices, provides its own instructions on how to prevent
the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review
the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective
operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application
advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please
visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact (or
review the applicable privacy web page of) the applicable platform
operator.</p>

<p><strong>VI. Other Important Information About Your Privacy</strong></p>

<p>1. How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</p>

<p>At this time Services on the Turner Network do not recognize automated
browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include "do not
track" instructions.</p>

<p>2. Linked Services</p>

<p>Some of the Services contain links to or integrations with other
services such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other media services
and platforms whose information practices may be different than ours.
Visitors should consult these other services' privacy notices as we have
no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these
third parties.</p>

<p>3. International Transfer</p>

<p>This Service is governed by and operated in accordance with US law. If
you are located outside of the US, you use this Service at your own
risk. Turner is a company that operates globally so it is necessary to
transfer your Information internationally. In particular, your
Information will be transferred to and processed in the United States
where many of our central databases operate. By using this Service, you
(a) acknowledge that the data protection and other laws of other
countries, such as the United States, may provide a less comprehensive
or protective standard of protection than those in your country, and
consent to your Information being collected, processed and transferred
as set forth in this Privacy Policy and US law.</p>

<p>4. Data Security</p>

<p>We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures
designed to help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security,
and to use correctly the Information we collect online. These safeguards
vary based on the sensitivity of the Information that we collect and
store.</p>

<p>Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized
disclosures of Information, we cannot assure you that Information will
never be disclosed, altered or destroyed in a manner that is
inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>5. How You Can Access or Correct Information</p>

<p>Access to certain personal Information that is collected from our
Services and that we maintain may be available to you. For example, if
you created a password-protected account within our Service, you can
access that account to review the Information you provided.</p>

<p>You may also send an e-mail or letter to the following e-mail or street
address requesting access to or correction of your personal Information.
Please include your registration information for such service such as
first name, last name and e-mail address in the request. We may ask you
to provide additional information for identity verification purposes, or
to verify that you are in possession of an applicable email account.</p>

parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes you may contact

<p>7. California Residents -- Your California Privacy Rights</p>

<p>California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires
certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers
asking about the business' practices related to disclosing personal
information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing
purposes. Alternately, businesses may have in place a policy not to
disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the
third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised
an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy
in place.</p>

<p><em>As discussed above in How to Contact Us/Opting Out of Marketing
Communications, if you wish to opt-out of our sharing of your personal
Information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing
purposes or to find out more about your opt-out rights, please contact
our Privacy Policy Coordinator as described
