	How does GREEKA store and protect personal data?</h3>
<p>
	When you are conducting financial transactions with your credit card via our online system, your credit card details are not transmitted to us, but to our partner organization (PayPal).

Hence, we have no access to your bank account or any other details of your credit card. From the beginning to the end of your online session all your information and personal details are encrypted under the encryption protocol Secure Sockets Layer – SSL. Every time you log or complete a payment via PayPal, the interaction between your computer and PayPal systems is encrypted via protocol SSL TLS v.1.2.<br>
	<br>

	Interpretation</h3>
<p>
	In this Privacy Policy, unless the context otherwise requires, the following expressions have the following meanings:|<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Personal Data:</strong> (Article 4 of the GDPR)personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.<br>
	<strong>Processing:</strong> (Article 4 of the GDPR): means any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data or sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, erasure or destruction.<br>
	<strong>Legal Basis for Processing:</strong> (Article 6 of the GDPR): At least one of these must apply whenever personal data is processed: 1. Consent: the individual has given clear consent for the processing of their personal data for a specific purpose. 2. Contract: the processing is necessary for compliance with a contract. 3. Legal obligation: the processing is necessary to comply with the law (not including contractual obligations). 4. Vital interests: the processing is necessary to protect someone’s life. 5. Public task: the processing is necessary to perform a task in the public interest, and the task or function has a clear basis in law. 6. Legitimate interests: the processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of the Data Controller unless there is a good reason to protect the individual’s personal data which overrides those legitimate interests.<br>
	<strong>Consent:</strong> the individual has given clear consent for the processing of their personal data for a specific purpose.<br>
	<strong>Contract:</strong> the processing is necessary for compliance with a contract.<br>
	<strong>Legal obligation:</strong> the processing is necessary to comply with the law (not including contractual obligations).<br>
	<strong>Vital interests:</strong> the processing is necessary to protect someone’s life.<br>
	<strong>Public task:</strong> the processing is necessary to perform a task in the public interest, and the task or function has a clear basis in law.<br>
	<strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> the processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of the Data Controller unless there is a good reason to protect the individual’s personal data which overrides those legitimate interests.<br>
	<strong>Data Controller:</strong> (Article 4 of the GDPR): this means the person or company that determines the purposes and the means of processing personal data.<br>
	<strong>Data Processor:</strong> (Article 4 of the GDPR): means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.<br>
	Data Subject Rights: (Chapter 3 of the GDPR) each Data Subject has eight rights. These are:<br>
	- The right to be informed; This means anyone processing your personal data must make clear what they are processing, why, and who else the data may be passed to.<br>
	- The right of access; this is your right to see what data is held about you by a Data Controller.<br>
	- The right to rectification; the right to have your data corrected or amended if what is held is incorrect in some way.<br>
	- The right to erasure; under certain circumstances you can ask for your personal data to be deleted. This is also called ‘the Right to be Forgotten’. This would apply if the personal data is no longer required for the purposes it was collected for, or your consent for the processing of that data has been withdrawn, or the personal data has been unlawfully processed.<br>
	- The right to restrict processing; this gives the Data Subject the right to ask for a temporary halt to processing of personal data, such as in the case where a dispute or legal case has to be concluded, or the data is being corrected.<br>
	- The right to data portability; a Data Subject has the right to ask for any data supplied directly to the Data Controller by him or her, to be provided in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.<br>
	- The right to object; the Data Subject has the right to object to further processing of their data which is inconsistent with the primary purpose for which it was collected, including profiling, automation, and direct marketing.<br>
	- Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling; Data Subjects have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing.</p></div></div>
