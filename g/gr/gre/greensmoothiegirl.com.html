            <p><span>GreenSmoothieGirl.com takes your privacy very seriously. This privacy policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site and our products and services. Please review this Privacy Policy before you use the Website or any of the services or features offered on or through the Site. By using the Website and its services and features, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or its services and features.</span></p>
<h3><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong></h3>
<p><span>GreenSmoothieGirl.com may collect certain personal information from you when you register to use the Website or its services and features, such as any email newsletter or membership to the free content library, including, but not limited to, your name, e-mail address, and location. We may also collect additional personal information, including your physical address, in order to deliver products. We may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information from users of our site, such as their Internet protocol address, the type of browser and operating system they use, the domain name of your Internet service provider, and the web pages, content and advertisements you may have visited, viewed or clicked on. We collect this information in several ways, including the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cookies:</strong><span>&nbsp;Cookies are text files placed in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies do not contain personal information, but if you choose to furnish us with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We may use “cookies” to maintain a record of your visits and to improve the content and services on our site.</span></li>
<li><strong>Web Server Logs</strong><span>: Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at this site, and the websites visited just before and just after our site. We, our advertisers and ad serving companies may also use small technology or pieces of code to determine which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them.</span></li>
<li><strong>IP Addresses:&nbsp;</strong><span>Our system may also collect your IP address, which is a numerical address that is used to identify a computer connected to the Internet. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our site, to deliver web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our site.</span></li>
<li><strong>Public Posting:</strong><span>&nbsp;If you post in the comments of a blog post on the Website (or anywhere on social media), you should be aware that any information you share is visible to other users. Personally identifiable information you submit to one of these forums can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages. GreenSmoothieGirl.com is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. For example, if you choose to make information, which was previously non-public, available by enabling certain user features, (such as blog comments) GreenSmoothieGirl.com will collect that information from your interaction and the information will become publicly available.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>INFORMATION FROM MINORS</strong></h3>
<p><span>GreenSmoothieGirl.com does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. Nor do we collect information from any individual under the age of 18 without the consent of a parent or guardian. If you believe that your child has registered on our site or that we have collected information from your child, please contact us immediately so that we can remove that information from our database.</span></p>
<p><span>GreenSmoothieGirl.com does recognize that parents, guardians, or other adults may purchase our products for family use, including use by minors. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing purposes, but because some information is collected electronically, it can appear to be the personal information of the purchaser of the product, and will be treated as such by this privacy policy.</span></p>
<h3><strong>HOW INFORMATION IS USED</strong></h3>
<p><span>GreenSmoothieGirl.com does not sell or rent your contact information to any third parties.</span></p>
<p><span>Except as otherwise disclosed to you, we will not sell, rent or disclose your personal information to third parties without notifying you of our intent to share the personal information in advance and giving you an opportunity to prevent your personal information from being shared.</span></p>
<p><span>We may use your personal information within GreenSmoothieGirl.com and associated websites to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>conduct and process transactions with you;</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span>We may use your non-personally identifiable information to analyze the usage of our site, improve the design and content of our site, deliver relevant marketing messages, personalize your Internet experience, and offer you products and services.

<h3><strong>HOW INFORMATION IS SHARED</strong></h3>
<p><span>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We will NEVER sell your personal information to third parties.</span></p>
<p><span>At times we may disclose your personal information as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process. We may also be required to disclose information about you if we determine that for security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span>We also may disclose user information when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property. We may also share information if it becomes necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.</span></p>
<h3><strong>HOW INFORMATION IS PROTECTED</strong></h3>
<p><span>GreenSmoothieGirl.com takes reasonable security measures to protect the security and confidentiality of your personal information that we collect and maintain against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information or that any communication or transmission of such information over the Internet will be entirely secure.</span></p>

<p><span>You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the internet. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure web browser. Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this reason, we request that you do not send private information to us via email.</span></p>

<li><span>We do not transfer any Facebook advertising data (including anonymous, aggregate, or derived data) to any ad network, ad exchange, data broker or other advertising or monetization related service.</span></li>
