                <p>GreenGeeks is committed to respecting and protecting the personal information and data of its visitors and customers.  This Privacy Policy covers the site <a href="https://www.greengeeks.com">https://www.greengeeks.com</a>.

                <p><b>A) Customer Contact and Account Information</b></p>
                <p>The information collected from customers is used to manage each customer’s account (e.g., billing and account management) and to promote other products or services that GreenGeeks believe may be of interest to its customers.  GreenGeeks may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from information that customers provide during registration.  GreenGeeks may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to promote advertisements that appear on GreenGeeks’ website and in connection with its services.  All such aggregated and non-identifying information that GreenGeeks collects, as well as any analysis of such information that GreenGeeks produces, is proprietary information of GreenGeeks.</p>
                <p><b>B) Analytics and Statistics</b></p>
                <p>GreenGeeks uses information gathered from its website analytics (e.g., user IP addresses) to help diagnose problems with GreenGeeks’ servers, and to administer and optimize GreenGeeks’ website.  GreenGeeks also collects broad demographic information from this data to help improve its website and services.  Any statistics gathered by Greengeeks are proprietary property of GreenGeeks.</p>
                <p><b>C) Support and Email Inquiries</b></p>
                <p>When customers send email inquiries and/or support requests to GreenGeeks, the return email address (and other personal information provided in the inquiry/request) is used to answer the email inquiry/request received.
                </p><p><b>D) Customer Surveys</b></p>
                <p>GreenGeeks may use the contact information provided in customer surveys to follow up on survey answers.  GreenGeeks may also contact you to highlight the changes GreenGeeks makes in response to your feedback.
                </p><p><b>E) Confidentiality</b></p>
                <p>With the exception of trusted business partners who work with or on behalf of GreenGeeks, and are subject to specific confidentiality agreements, GreenGeeks will not provide or sell to any third party your personal information and will keep all customer information confidential, subject to the following:
                
                </p><ol type="a" style="margin-left: 50px;">
                    <li> GreenGeeks does not share personally identifiable information about individual users with advertisers.  GreenGeeks may display online advertisements and share aggregated and non-identifying information about customers collected through the registration process or through online surveys and promotions with certain advertisers.  This aggregated and non-identifying information may be used to deliver tailored advertisements.<br><br></li>
                    <li> GreenGeeks may share aggregated, non-personally identifying information obtained from customer surveys with third parties.<br><br></li>
                    <li> GreenGeeks may access, preserve and share customer information with companies, organizations, governmental entities, or individuals outside of GreenGeeks if we believe, in good faith and in our sole discretion, that the law requires us to do so.  This may include, but is not limited to, responding to subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes.  Greengeeks may access, preserve, and share customer information as necessary to: establish or exercise GreenGeeks’ legal rights or defend against any claim including threatened claims; investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected fraud or other illegal activities; prevent death or serious physical harm to any person; or investigate violations of GreenGeeks’ <a href="/legal/tos">Terms of Service</a>.<br><br></li>
                    <li> In certain jurisdictions or pursuant to the rules of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”) or certain registries, domain name registration information has to be made available and accessible to the public through a “WHOIS” search.  The WHOIS is a publicly accessible database that lists the domain name registration information for a particular domain name, the name server(s) to which the domain name points, and the domain name’s creation and expiration date.  GreenGeeks may deposit your domain registration information with a third-party escrow provider to comply with ICANN requirements.  At times, customers may receive solicitations that result from searches of the publicly available databases by other companies or individuals.  Any such solicitations or SPAM do not come from GreenGeeks and GreenGeeks does not control the use of WHOIS information by third parties.<br><br></li>
                </ol>


                <h4>DATA SECURITY</h4>
                <p>GreenGeeks uses multiple security measures to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Your data is protected using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, the industry standard. This encrypts order data and is designed to aid in ensuring the accuracy and security of that customer information.  In the unlikely event of a data breach, GreenGeeks will notify the appropriate regulatory and/or legal authorities, as well as affected customers/individuals, within seventy-two (72) hours.</p>
                
                <h4>CUSTOMER OPTIONS</h4>
                
                <ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
                    <li><b>Public Forums</b><br><br><p>Be advised that any information you may disclose or post in forums or other public areas of GreenGeeks’ website or the Internet, becomes public information.  You should always exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these public areas.  To request removal of your personal information from GreenGeeks community forums or testimonials, contact GreenGeeks at <a href="mailto:privacy@greengeeks.com">privacy@greengeeks.com</a>.  In some cases, GreenGeeks may be unable to remove your personal information, in which case GreenGeeks will let you know why it is unable to do so.</p></li>

GreenGeeks may request certain personal information for the purposes of verifying the identity of the individual seeking access or erasure of individual/customer records.</p>
                    <p>To ensure customers receive the information they need to manage their account and protect their privacy, GreenGeeks asks that customers keep their contact and billing information up to date.

                </p><p><b>Restriction of Processing</b>
                </p><p>You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal information GreenGeeks holds about you other than for storage purposes in the following circumstances: (1) you believe the personal information is not accurate for the period it takes for us to verify whether the data is accurate; GreenGeeks wishes to erase the personal information as the processing it is doing is unlawful, but you want GreenGeeks to simply restrict the use of that data; (3) GreenGeeks no longer needs the personal information for the purposes of the processing but you require it to retain the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or (4) you have objected to GreenGeeks processing personal information it holds about you on the basis of its legitimate interest and you wish it to stop processing the personal information while it determines whether there is an overriding interest in GreenGeeks retaining such information.

                </p><p><b>Objection</b>
                </p><p>You have the right to object to GreenGeeks’ processing of data about you and GreenGeeks will consider the request.  Please provide detail as to your reasoning so that GreenGeeks can assess whether there is a compelling overriding interest in it continuing to process such data.  You also have the right, at any time, to object to GreenGeeks’ processing of data about you in order to send you marketing.

                </p><p><b>Withdrawal of Consent</b>
                </p><p>Where you have provided your consent to GreenGeeks processing your personal data, you can withdraw your consent at any time by visiting the Account Manager, or by contacting GreenGeeks at <a href="mailto:privacy@greengeeks.com">privacy@greengeeks.com</a>
