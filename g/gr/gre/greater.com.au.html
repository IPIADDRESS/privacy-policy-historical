        <h3>1. Key types of information</h3>
        <p>Certain words have special meanings when used in this APP Privacy and Credit Information Policy. These are shown below.</p>
        <p>"Personal information" means information or an opinion about an individual who is identified, or who can reasonably be identified, from the information. Although we try to make sure that all information we hold is accurate, "personal information" also includes any inaccurate information about the individual.</p>
        <p>"Credit eligibility information" means information that has been obtained from a credit reporting body, or that has been derived from that information, that is about an individual's credit worthiness.</p>
        <p>"Credit information" means personal information that includes the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>information about an individual, like their name and address, that we may use to identify that individual </li>
            <li>information about an individual's current or terminated consumer credit accounts and, from 12 March 2014, an individual's repayment history </li>
            <li>the type and amount of credit applied for in any previous consumer or commercial credit applications to any credit provider, where that credit provider has requested information&nbsp; </li>
            <li>information about an individual from a credit reporting body&nbsp; </li>
            <li>information about consumer credit payments overdue for at least 60 days and for which collection action has started </li>
            <li>advice that payments that were previously notified to a credit reporting body as overdue are no longer overdue </li>
            <li>information about new credit arrangements an individual may have made with a credit provider, in relation to consumer credit currently or previously held, to deal with any defaults or serious credit infringements by that individual </li>
            <li>information about court judgments which relate to credit that an individual has obtained or applied for </li>
            <li>information about an individual on the National Personal Insolvency Index </li>
            <li>publicly available information about an individual's credit worthiness, and&nbsp; </li>
            <li>an opinion of a credit provider that an individual has committed a serious credit infringement of credit provided by that credit provider. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may not hold all of these kinds of information about a particular individual. However, if we hold any of these kinds of information, it is protected as "credit information" under this Policy. </p>
        <p>"Credit-related information" means credit information, credit eligibility information and related information.</p>
        <h3>2. Collection</h3>
        <p>Wherever possible, we will collect personal information (including credit information) directly from you.&nbsp; This information will generally come from what you provide in your application for one of our products or services and supporting documentation.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>We only ask for personal information relevant to our business relationship with a customer. When you apply for one of our products or services, we may request:</p>
        <ul>

        <p>We may also collect personal information (including credit-related information) about you from third parties, such as any referees that you provide, your employer, other credit providers and third party service providers including credit reporting bodies.&nbsp; Credit reporting bodies collect credit information about individuals which they provide as credit reports to credit providers and others in the credit industry to assist them in managing credit risk, collecting debts and other activities. You can also ask a credit reporting body, through contact details on their website, not to use or disclose your personal information if you believe on reasonable grounds that you have been or are likely to be a victim of fraud, including identity fraud.</p>
        <p>Some information is created through our internal processes, like credit eligibility scoring information.</p>

        <h3>6. Refusal of credit applications</h3>

In that case, we will give you written notice that the application has been refused on the basis of that information. We will tell you the name and contact details of the relevant credit reporting body and other relevant information.</p>
