<p><strong><br>
<strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></strong></p>
<p>As with many websites, when you visit GreenGamesandHam, GreenGamesandHam automatically gathers certain NPII based on your computer information and stores it in log files. This type of technical and statistical information is used to customize your experience at GreenGamesandHam, to help us improve the quality of GreenGamesandHam and to make your visits to GreenGamesandHam easy, convenient and fun. GreenGamesandHam also collect your IP (Internet protocol) address to help diagnose problems with the site server and for Site administration purposes.</p>
<p>Finally, we and some of our Third Party Advertisers as well as third party ad servers also use cookies, web beacons, clear GIFs, and other monitoring technologies to gather anonymous information. The most common of these technologies are described in more detail below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies</span>. Cookies are small data files that the GreenGamesandHam server places on an individual’s computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site and the Company. We do not tie any PII to the cookies that we set. Cookies also enable us, or our Third Party Advertisers, to use anonymous behavioral profiles and demographic inferences to increase the relevance of online ads that Premium Members receive. Some GreenGamesandHam ads include “web beacons” and some of our Third Party Advertisers may include web beacons on some of their web pages at our request. These web beacons allow us to access the cookies we set and provide ad campaign analysis. While some Web browsers allow a User to automatically reject all cookies or be notified when a cookie is about to be placed on the User’s computer, disabling this feature may compromise the efficiency and added services that our cookies provide. If you ever uninstall the Software, no Game Awesome LLC cookies or tracking assets will remain. <strong>. The use of cookies by Third Party Advertisers or ad servers is not subject to this Policy, but is subject to those third parties’ respective privacy policies. If you have a question about such third parties’ privacy policies, you will have to go to their websites for more information and/or contact them directly</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clear GIFs</span>. We employ or our third party business partners may employ a common technology known as a “Clear GIF” or “1-by-1 Pixel” on the Site and in e-mail communications with Users. A Clear GIF, or “graphic interface format” is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1×1 pixel) that is placed on the Site or in an e-mail. The GIFs do not contain any PII but they, provide us with important information about how Users use GreenGamesandHam and respond to e-mail messages. With this information, GreenGamesandHam or our Business Partners are better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative presentations. We may also allow our Third Party Advertisers the ability to use GIFs on the Site solely to track Premium Users who link from the Third Party Advertisers’ respective sites to GreenGamesandHam.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flash LSOs</span></p>
<p>On some of our sites our third party gaming partners use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to provide games and participate in tournaments.</p>
<p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.&nbsp; Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.&nbsp; To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here:</p>
