          <h3>Our Commitment To Privacy</h3>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. Our ongoing commitment to the protection of your privacy is essential to maintaining the relationship of trust that exists between GreatNonprofits and all of our users, whether they be nonprofit organizations, volunteers, clients or donors of nonprofits, or other visitors to the site. This notice of our privacy policy is intended to help you understand our online information security practices.</p>

<h3>The Information We Collect</h3>

<p>You may have accessed GreatNonprofits directly by visiting our Web site, the home page of which is located at www.GreatNonprofits.org, or through the Web site of one of our third-party partners. This notice applies to all information you submit to GreatNonprofits, whether through the GreatNonprofits Web site or through the Web site of one of our Partners. Please note that we cannot be responsible for the information you submit directly to third parties, including our Partners, who may have their own posted policies regarding the collection and use of your information. We urge you to review the policies of our Partners through whom you may access our services.</p>

<p>GreatNonprofits collects user submitted account information such as your email address to identify you and send you notifications related to the use of the service. GreatNonprofits also collects user submitted location information such as city, state, or zip code. GreatNonprofits also collects user submitted photos, reviews, and ratings of nonprofits.</p>

<p>Some information collected is not explicitly submitted by the user; we log your browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp.</p>

<h3>How We Use Information</h3>

<p>Your full name and email address may also be used when you send an email notification to a friend (such as in an invitation, or when sharing a review). We may also use your email address to send you updates or news regarding our site, but you may choose not to receive email of this type by accessing the “Account” tab of the web site and updating your notification settings. Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message).</p>

<p>Browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp data help us diagnose problems with our server, administer GreatNonprofits, and otherwise provide the highest possible level of service to you. In addition, we use this information to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, their advertising banners.</p>

<p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. We do not, however, sell, rent or trade our volunteer, administrator, nonprofit, or general newsletter email addresses to outside parties.</p>

<p>Please be aware that, to the extent required to provide our services, we share your Information with volunteers, nonprofit organizations, or our Partners, as applicable:</p>

<h3>For Newsletter Subscribers</h3>

<p>We may use our email lists for sending out our newsletter and other GreatNonprofits outbound communications, such as product enhancements, tool upgrades, or membership news.</p>

<p>Additionally, for volunteers with a personal account who have accessed GreatNonprofits through www.greatnonprofits.org or a Partner’s Web site: 
If you indicate to us that you are interested in creating a personalized account, the information we gather from you will be used to permit you to: access the account, customize outbound email services, review your referral history and/or post a resume that can be sent as an attachment to inquiries you make using the GreatNonprofits service.</p>

<h3>For Nonprofit Organizations</h3>

<p>If you submit Information to us as a nonprofit organization, then, subject to the terms and conditions as a nonprofit member of GreatNonprofits, your Information (excluding your EIN number) will be accessible by anyone who accesses GreatNonprofits. In addition, we may share your Information, including your EIN number, with selected Partners in order to verify your organization’s identity and tax status.</p>

<h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>

<p>We welcome users of all ages, including children under the age of thirteen. Due to our status as a non-profit organization, we are not required to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). However, we strongly encourage our users aged thirteen and under to use our services only with parental consent.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>Cookies are tiny data files that Web sites commonly write to your hard drive when you visit them so that they can remember you when you visit. A cookie file contains information that can identify you anonymously and maintain your account’s privacy. Our site uses cookies to maintain a user’s identity between sessions so that the site can be personalized based on user preferences or a user’s history. You can set your Web browser to prompt you before you accept a cookie, accept cookies automatically or reject all cookies. However, if you choose not to accept cookies from this Web site, then you may not be able to access and use all or part of this Web site or benefit from the information and services which it offers.</p>

<h3>Third-party Access and Use</h3>

<p>Occasionally, we or our Partners hire third-party service providers to help provide or improve the services we offer you. Sometimes it is necessary for these providers to have access to the Information we collect about you. In those cases, we take reasonable steps to ensure that these providers do not use or otherwise disclose any Information we collect about you except for the purpose of fulfilling their service obligations to us and our Partners.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that GreatNonprofits undergoes a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets, the acquiring entity will be subject to this Privacy Policy in its use of your personally identifiable Information. In addition, in the further unlikely event that GreatNonprofits is adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent (a) there will be no further use or disclosure of your personally identifiable Information by GreatNonprofits and (b) your personally identifiable Information will be destroyed. In addition, there will be no use or disclosure of your personally identifiable Information by any entity that acquires assets of GreatNonprofits pursuant to such bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.</p>

<p>Your privacy is very important to us. Due to factors beyond our control, however, we cannot fully ensure that your Information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be legally obligated to disclose Information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access your Personal Information.</p>
