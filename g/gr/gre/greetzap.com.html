                be inaccurate or deficient shall be corrected or amended as feasible, subject to
                any requirement for such personal information or sensitive personal data or information
                to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users
                to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or
                removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests
                that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical
                effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for
                instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which
                access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access
                and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would
                require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services,
                after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before
                they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.

            <p>
                We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to
                or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal
                reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures,
                including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against
                unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.</p>

                All information gathered on TML is securely stored within the TML controlled database.
                The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers
                is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security
                measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security
                of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted
                while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information
                you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet

                However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our privacy policy
                from time to time to incorporate necessary future changes. Of course, our use of
                any information we gather will always be consistent with the policy under which

            </p>

                &nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                1. GreetZAP does not violate any law or the rights of any individual or entity,
                and does not expose Facebook or Facebook users to harm or legal liability as determined
                by Facebook in our sole discretion. In particular we (if applicable): comply with
                the Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA), and obtain any opt-in consent necessary
                from users so that user data subject to the VPPA may be shared on Facebook. We represent
                that any disclosure to Facebook will not be incidental to the ordinary course of
                our business.
                <br>
                2. GreetZAP does not include functionality that proxies, requests or collects Facebook
                usernames or passwords.<br>
                3. GreetZAP does not circumvent (or claim to circumvent) our intended limitations
                on core Facebook features and functionality.
                <br>
                4. When we offer a service for a user that integrates user data into a physical
                product (such as a voice card), we only create a physical product for that user's
                personal and non-commercial use.
                <br>
                5. GreetZAP website offers an explicit "Log Out" option that also logs
                the user out of Facebook.<br>
                6. Special provision for apps on Pages: When a user visits our Page, if they have
                not given explicit permission by authorizing our Facebook app or directly providing
                information to our Page, we only use information obtained from Facebook and the
                user's interaction with our Page in connection with that Page.
                <br>
                7. GreetZAP does not use or make derivative use of Facebook icons, or use terms
                for Facebook features and functionality, if such use could confuse users into thinking
                that the reference is to Facebook features or functionality.
                <br>
                8. Reciprocity and Replicating core functionality:
                <br>
                (a) Reciprocity: We enable people to easily share their experiences back with people
                on Facebook.
                <br>
                (b) Replicating core functionality: We do not use Facebook Platform to promote,
                or to export user data to, a product or service that replicates a core Facebook
                product or service without our permission.
                <br>
                9. We do not include data obtained from Facebook in any search engine or directory
                without their written permission.</p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                <strong>II. Storing and Using Data You Receive From Us</strong></p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                1. GreetZAP only requests the data we need to operate our application.<br>
                2. GreetZAP may cache data that we receive through use of the Facebook API in order
                to improve our application’s user experience, but also try to keep the data up to
                date. This permission does not give us any rights to such data.
                <br>
                3. We have a privacy policy that tells users what user data we are going to use
                and how we will use, display, share, or transfer that data. In addition, we will
                include our privacy policy URL in the App Dashboard, and must also include a link
                to your app's privacy policy in any app marketplace that provides you with the functionality
                to do so.
                <br>
                4. Subject to certain restrictions, including on use and transfer, users give us
                their <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/policy/">basic account information</a>
                when they with our application. For all other data obtained through use of the Facebook
                API, we obtain explicit consent from the user who provided the data to us before
                using it for any purpose other than displaying it back to the user on our application.
                <br>
                5. GreetZAP does not directly or indirectly transfer any data we receive from Facebook,
                including user data or Facebook User IDs, to (or use such data in connection with)
                any ad network, ad exchange, data broker, or other advertising or monetization related
                toolset, even if a user consents to such transfer or use. By indirectly we mean
                we cannot, for example, transfer data to a third party who then transfers the data
                to an ad network. By any data we mean all data obtained through use of the Facebook
                Platform (API, Social Plugins, etc.), including aggregate, anonymous or derivative
                data.
                <br>
                6. GreetZAP does not use Facebook User IDs for any purpose outside the application
                (e.g.,infrastructure, code, or services necessary to build and run application).
                Facebook User IDs may be used with external services that we use to build and run
                application, such as a web infrastructure service or a distributed computing platform,
                but only if those services are necessary to running application and the service
                has a contractual obligation with us to keep Facebook User IDs confidential.
                <br>
                7. In case we need an anonymous unique identifier to share outside application with
                third parties such as content partners, advertisers, or ad networks, we use our
                <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/user/">mechanism</a>.
                We do not ever share this anonymous unique identifier with a data broker, information
                broker, or any other service.
                <br>
                8. GreetZAP does not sell or purchase any data obtained from Facebook by anyone.
                Incase if we are acquired by or merge with a third party, we can continue to use
                user data within application, but we will not transfer data outside your application.
                <br>
                9. Incase if we stop using Platform or Facebook disables application, we will delete
                all information about a user we have received from Facebook unless: (a) it is basic
                account information; or (b) we have received explicit consent from the user to retain
                their data.
                <br>
                10. GreetZAP does not use a user’s friend list outside application, even if a user
                consents to such use, but we can use connections between users who have both connected
                to application.
                <br>
                11. GreetZAP will delete all data it receives from us concerning a user if the user
                asks us to do so, and will provide an easily accessible mechanism for users to make
                such a request. Facebook may require GreetZAP to delete data we receive from the
                Facebook API if we violate our terms.
                <br>
                12. GreetZAP does not include data received from Facebook concerning a user in any
                advertising creative, even if a user consents to such use.
                <br>
                13. GreetZAP does not give secret key and access tokens to another party, unless
                that party is an agent acting on our behalf as an operator of your application.
                You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account identifiers.

                1. Responsibility for content: GreetZAP is responsible for all content of and within
                application, including advertisements, user-generated content, and any content hosted,

                by Facebook. We also comply with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards">

                2. Demographic restrictions: GreetZAP is responsible for restricting access to content
                in accordance with content policies and all applicable laws and regulations. Please
                note that Facebook makes no representations regarding the sufficiency of any controls
                provided and that we are ultimately responsible for establishing legally compliant
                restrictions for each country where our app is visible.
                <br>

                <br>
                4. Promotions: When we run, reference, or facilitate a promotion (contest, competition,
                or sweepstake) on Facebook, we comply with Facebook’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/page_guidelines.php">
                    Promotions Guidelines</a>.
                <br>
                5. Permission from Facebook: We do not promote, or provide content referencing,
                facilitating, or containing online gambling, online real money games of skill or
                online lotteries without our written permission.
                <br>
                6. Quality of content: GreetZAP is responsible for providing users with a quality
                experience and must not confuse, defraud, mislead, spam or surprise users. For example,
                you must monitor your app's negative feedback in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/insights/">
                    Application Insights</a> to ensure it stays below our thresholds, avoid excessive
                advertisements or bugs, and ensure the description of your app is consistent with
                your app's content.
            </p>
            <p>

                <strong>B. Content Rights</strong></p>
            <p>

            <p>
                1. GreetZAP does not promote or provide content that references, facilitates, contains
                or uses content that infringes upon the rights of any third party, including intellectual
                property rights, privacy, publicity, moral or other personal or proprietary rights,
                or that is deceptive or fraudulent.

                3. GreetZAP is responsible for all licensing, reporting and payout obligations to

                to application's content in countries where we are unauthorized to deliver such
                content, or where delivery of such content would otherwise infringe the rights of
                a third party.
                <br>
                5. Although we have no obligation to do so, in our sole discretion we may request,

                must comply with the following rules:</p>
            <p>
                1. In the United States you must take all steps required to fall within the applicable
                safe harbors of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act including designating an agent
                to receive notices of claimed infringement, instituting a repeat infringer termination
                policy and implementing a "notice and takedown" process. In other countries,
