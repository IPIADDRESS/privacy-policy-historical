    <h1>Greenwala Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Greenwala.com, The Green Social Network is a website (the “Website”) for sharing green facts, engage in a community, view photos &amp; videos and participate in marketing campaigns with other green lovers. It is operated by Greenwala, Inc., a privately held company in Lake Forest, CA, USA.</p>
<p>Your personal privacy is EXTREMELY important to us. This Privacy Policy, effective October 27th, 2008, explains how we collect and use your personally identifiable information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. By using Greenwala.com, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in the Privacy Policy. From time to time, we may update the Privacy Policy and we will post a notice of significant changes on the Website. You should visit this page periodically to review any such changes to the Privacy Policy. All changes to this Policy will be effective when a new version is posted. Your continued use of the Website after the posting will constitute your acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, the new Policy.<br></p>
<p><strong>The information we collect</strong></p>
<p>When you register to become a member of Greenwala.com, we collect your name, e-mail address and optionally your hometown, state and country. Except as specifically set forth otherwise in this Policy, your name and e-mail will never be shared, rented, bartered or sold with other users or third-party companies. All other information entered about you will only be used by Greenwala.com to display on the Website and will never be shared, rented, bartered, sold or exchanged any other purposeful manner. The Website, however, is accessible by anyone with an Internet connection and a web browser, which means that any words and photos you post can be copied by any other Internet user. That is the nature of the Internet and though we discourage anyone from abusing that option, it is something that must be noted.<br> In order to provide the best possible service and detect and correct Website errors, we collect aggregate information about use of the Website (such as which page are most often viewed) and we collect information about your computer, such as such as browser type, browser language, and IP address. This information as well is never shared with anyone.<br></p>
<p>We may offer marketing campaigns and contests and other online events on the Website in collaboration with third-parties. Please be advised that if you participate in such contests or events, we may share your name and e-mail address with such third-parties only. Please carefully read the rules of such contests or events before you participate to familiarize yourself with any other deviations from this Policy.<br></p>
<p><strong>How we use your information</strong></p>
<p>Your human name and e-mail will never be shared with anyone in anyway. If you chose to enter your human hometown, state or country that information may be displayed in any of your green profile web pages on the Website, but the green page does not share any other personal information or allow access to it. When a user submits a Tell-A-Friend form we never store or copy any of the sender or recipient e-mails for any period of time.<br></p>
<p>The biographical information you enter about your green profile(s) is instantly available to all other users of the Website. Greenwala does not claim rights for the pictures uploaded or the text information you add to the Website. Please note, however, that Greenwala.com is a public Website and thus all photos and information you provide are available to anyone with Internet access. Due to the nature of the internet, it is impossible for Greenwala.com to be a protectorate of your green facts and photos, so you should never post a photo or fact that you do not now or ever want someone else to have access to.<br></p>
<p><strong>Legal requests</strong></p>
<p>You understand and agree that Greenwala.com may access, preserve, and disclose your personal information and the contents of your account if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to protect the rights and property of Greenwala.com, its affiliates or the public.<br></p>
<p><strong>Controlling your personal information</strong></p>
<p>You have complete control of the information you submit to Greenwala. You may at anytime edit any information or remove your green profile and personal accounts entirely. Greenwala.com only requires a user to give a valid e-mail while you have an account so we may contact you.<br> Please note, we reserve the right to transfer your submitted information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Greenwala.com, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, Greenwala.com will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.<br></p>
<p>When playing the Treewala game on Greenwala you acknowledge that the Challenge feature is solely used at your discretion and therefore you should only challenge those you know. Greenwala is not responsible or liable for any loss attributed to playing the game. While playing the game, if you come across an error you will need to send an e-mail to info@greenwala.com with the error and if possible the correct answer.
