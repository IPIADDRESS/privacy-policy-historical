            administer our Web site. When registering for GreatDomains.com’s services, the registration form requires you to give us contact information,
            such as your name, address, e-mail address,unique identifiers, and demographic information. In the course of using our site, we automatically track
            additional information, such as the URL that you just came from, which URL you

            enter your password less frequently during a session and enable us to provide

         <p>If you choose to place an offer or to sell a Domain Name on our Web site, we will
            collect information about your purchasing and selling behavior. We may also collect comments provided by
            other users in our feedback area.</p><p>
            
         </p><p>If you elect to use additional services provided by GreatDomains.com, such as our
            escrow services, additional financial and personal information will be
            collected, such as your billing address and other specific
            financial information, collected directly or from transaction documents used in
            the process to establish the financial resources

            policy administered by each such Web site.</p>
            
         <p><b>How the Information Is Used</b></p>
         
         <p>GreatDomains.com uses personal information for internal purposes only, to provide those services
            that you are requesting, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to
            statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and service offerings,
            to customize our site’s content and layout, and to further enhance the services that we
            provide. We may also use personally
            identifiable information about you to deliver information to you that, in some
            cases, is targeted to your interest, such as targeted banners and promotions.You can always remove yourself from
            receiving such information by notifying us by using the opt-out option in the “My Profile” page.</p>    
         
         <p>Mailing information, such as your e-mail address, may be used in rare situations
            for us to contact you regarding an administrative issue. Address and billing
            information may be used if you elect to use our escrow services,
            or in the event that we are entitled to a transfer fee for a sale conducted
            through our Web site.</p>    
         
         <p>We may also use information in the file that we maintain regarding your current
            and past activities in the unlikely event that we need to resolve disputes,
            troubleshoot problems,or otherwise to enforce our User Agreement. 
            At times, cross-sectional information may be
            used of multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes.</p>
            
         <p>In order to defer some of the costs of doing business, and thus, to be able to
            charge the user lower fees, GreatDomains.com generates additional revenue by
            way of delivering targeted advertisements. When delivering such advertisements, GreatDomains.com serves as the
            middleman, delivering the advertisement according to certain criteria requested
            by the advertisers, such as particular demographics. GreatDomains.com will then display the advertisement to users who
            meet that this criteria. In During this process,
            the third-party advertiser does not have access to your individual account
            information.</p>
            
         <p><b>With Whom Does GreatDomains.com Share Your Information?</b></p>
        
         <p>As a general rule, GreatDomains.com does not disclose any of your personally
            identifiable information, unless we have your specific permission, or under
            special circumstances, such as when we reasonably believe that the law requires
            that we do so. We do aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in the
            aggregate as historical, statistical data for marketing, and promotional
            situations. However, in such situations, it is not possible to personally identify you or your personal
            information. Certain information, such as your password, credit card information, or bank account number would not be
            disclosed in such aggregate disclosures.</p>
            
         <p>GreatDomains.com cooperates with all law enforcement inquiries and with third-parties who are
            enforcing their intellectual property or other proprietary rights. We, of course, also provide that the information which
            is necessary to facilitate the actual, ongoing commercial activities conducted
            on the GreatDomains.com Web site. For example, we will provide identifying information to the parties that
            have agreed upon the purchase and sale of a Domain Name, so that they may
            continue and conclude the transaction. All recipients of the transaction agree to the restrictions of on how they can use
            and disclose such information.</p>
            
         <p>In sum, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do
            not and cannot promise, and you cannot expect, that your personally identifiable
            communications will always remain private.</p>
            
        <p><b>Your Use of Other Users’ Information.</b></p>
        
        <p>As a seller, you will be sent certain private information identifying the buyer of
           your Internet Domain Name, and as a buyer, you will be sent identifying
           information of the seller. By entering into our User Agreement,
           you agree that any personally identifying information that you obtain through
           the GreatDomains.com Web site or through a GreatDomains.com-related communication or a GreatDomains.com-facilitated
           transaction, you are granted a limited license to use such information only for
           the furthering of the subject matter of the GreatDomains.com-related
           transaction, including GreatDomains.com-facilitated services, such as its
           escrow services. Upon conclusion of the transaction, you will remove and delete all copies in all forms of the
           personally-identifying third party information, other than one copy of only
           that data which is necessary for the archivaling of the
           transaction, unless you receive explicit, specific written approval from the
           Registrant of the personal information that you need not do so.</p>
           
        <p><b>Updating and Correcting Personally Identifying Information</b></p>
        
        <p>Once you register with GreatDomains.com, you will be able and are allowed to change
           your personally identifying information available at GreatDomains.com,
           including your e-mail address, user ID, name, address, telephone number, password, and credit card
           information. Upon your request, we will remove any of the above personally identifying information other than your name
           and user ID. We will send you a confirmation of the information that you requested us to remove and the date of its
           removal. We will retain in our files certain information in our files that you have requested us to
           remove for different purposes, such as to resolve potential dispute,
           troubleshoot problems,and otherwise enforce our User Agreement. 
           Furthermore, certain circumstances could prevent the complete and permanent removal of such information from our
           databases such as technical constraints and the periodic backing up and
           archiving of our systems for disaster recovery purposes.</p>
         
        <p><b>General</b></p>
        
        <p>Our Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information that we
           collect. To the extent that you disclose information to other parties, even if you connected to those parties
           through the GreatDomains.com Web site,

           resources to break down the protective systems that we have established and obtain
           your personal information.This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the
           GreatDomains.com User Agreement.</p>
