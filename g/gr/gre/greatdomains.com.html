</p></strong><p><strong>How Your Information Is Gathered </strong>

</p><p>GreatDomains.com collects information in a variety of ways. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. When registering for GreatDomains's services, the registration form requires you to give us contact information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, unique identifiers, and demographic information. In the course of using our site, we automatically track additional information, such as the URL that you just came from, which URL you go to next, and what browser you were using. Many sites typically collect information of this sort automatically. 

</p><p>In addition, GreatDomains uses cookies for certain pages of our site. The use of cookies streamlines your use of and access to our Web site. Among other reasons, cookies allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session and enable us to provide information that is targeted to your interest.

Many cookies are "session cookies" that are automatically deleted at the end of a session.
