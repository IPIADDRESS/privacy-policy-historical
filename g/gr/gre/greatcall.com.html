<h5>
    Information Collection
</h5>
<p>
    We gather personal information needed to provide requested products or services, communicate offers on products and services that we believe will be of interest to the recipient and to administer our business. We do not collect any personal information at our Web site unless you choose to provide it to us voluntarily. We define “personal information” as information that is unique to an individual and might include a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, phone number, other contact information, title, occupation, employer, gender, date of birth, industry, personal interests, and other information when needed to provide a service requested from GreatCall. In limited circumstances, we may collect payment information such as credit card number where needed to complete a requested service or transaction. By requesting information to your mobile phone, we may obtain the following information from you: your mobile phone number, your device ID number, your carrier's name, and the date, time and content of your messages, as well as other information that you provide. We will use such information in accordance with this privacy policy. If you encounter a screen or page that requests information you do not want to share with us, do not enter the information and do not proceed with that screen or page.
</p>
<p>
    When you browse our Web site, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously indicated that you wish GreatCall to remember your login and password. We don't automatically collect personal information, including your email address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our Web site you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to any personal information. Like many other web sites, GreatCall's Web site may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site. Please go to "Cookies and Tracking Information" below for more information.
</p>
<p>
    GreatCall collects personal information when you register with greatcall.com for a greatcall.com client account, when you use certain GreatCall products or services, when you register to participate in an online survey, when you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list, or when you submit your personal information to greatcall.com for any other reason.
</p>
<p>
    From time to time, GreatCall may receive personal information from commercial vendors and partners as part of an email list purchase. GreatCall only uses such information if it has been collected in accordance with acceptable privacy practices consistent with this Policy and applicable laws.
</p>
<h5>
    Providing Us with Personal Information of Third Parties
</h5>
<p>
    If you provide us with the personal information of another person such as your parent or your child, or direct us to share that person’s information with another person such as your sibling, you represent and warrant to GreatCall that you either (1) have full legal authority to provide such information or instructions (e.g., through power of attorney or guardianship of an elderly parent, or parental authority over a minor child), or (2) have obtained such person’s express and informed authorization to provide such information or instructions. Furthermore, when obtaining any such authorization, you must first provide him or her with a copy of this privacy policy and explain how his or her personal information will be used pursuant to this privacy policy. Periodically, you should review this privacy policy for updates and inform such third party of any such updates. By providing such person’s information or instructions to GreatCall on our Web site, you represent and warrant that you have complied with your obligations under this privacy policy.
</p>
<h5>
    Notice
</h5>
<p>
    We will always give you the opportunity to “opt out” of receiving direct marketing, market research information or surveys. This means we assume you have given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this privacy policy unless you take affirmative action to indicate that you do not consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at the point of collection. In some cases, when applicable, we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in." This means we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted.
</p>
<h5>
    Cookies and Tracking Technology
</h5>
<p>
    A cookie is a small data file that certain web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of GreatCall's Web site use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We may also employ web beacons, or site instrumentation, to monitor the behavior and visitors to our Web site and activity of our Web site, such as the number of visitors to our Web site. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our Web site information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. We also use cookies to verify the efficacy of our advertising and online marketing programs, using third party software to analyze the tracking results. The information is viewed in aggregate, meaning your personal information is not used or displayed.
</p>
<p>
    If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our Web site, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of GreatCall's Web site if you do so. In particular, you may be required to accept cookies in order to complete certain actions on our Web site. You do not need to have cookies turned on, however, to use/navigate through many parts of our Web site, except access to certain of GreatCall Web site web pages may require a login and password.
</p>
<p>
    We may also employ third party service providers to place and administer such cookies and web beacons on our Web site. Such third parties may also collect your anonymized information and perform web site analytics as described in this privacy policy. We may reproduce work product created by such third parties based upon web analytics data or other similar data collected from visitors to our Web site in order to facilitate the serving of data or content in connection with providing you with more relevant advertising and content.
</p>
<h5>

When you engage in any of the foregoing activities, or use any other features or services of our Web site, you may provide us with certain personal information. We collect and store this personal information, any updates to such information that you send us, and any modifications that we make to such information.

<h5>
    Opting Out
</h5>
<p>
    GreatCall displays retargeted ads to our Web site prospects across the Internet. We collect non‐personal information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and services. The anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites. No personal information is collected during this process. If you do not want GreatCall to collect this information, you may opt out of this service. Opting out will not in any way affect your use of our Web site. To opt‐out of retargeting, please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">click here</a>.

<h5>
    Data Security
</h5>
<p>
    Your greatcall.com account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. GreatCall safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. In certain areas of our Web site, GreatCall may use industry-standard SSL-encryption to enhance the security of data transmissions. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us, and so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet.
</p>
<h5>
    Children and Privacy
</h5>
<p>
    We are sensitive to privacy issues and look to protect your child’s information. We also strive to be fully compliant with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We strongly encourage parents and guardians to regularly monitor and supervise their children’s online activities. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 on our Web site without first obtaining verifiable consent from the child’s parent or guardian. Some of our sweepstakes will collect email addresses only without requesting the age of the entrants. All winners will be requested to provide their age. If your child under 13 is a winner, we will contact your child one time by email to request that you or your child provide by mail the information we need for prize fulfillment purposes.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>We do not require your child to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity.</li>
    <li>Please also note that we do not offer activities that require the ongoing collection and use of personal information provided by children, so we will seek your permission each time we need to collect personal information from your child.</li>
    <li>
        If you would like to review personal information about your child that we have on file, or request that certain information be changed or deleted, please send us an email through our
        <a href="/support/contact-us">
            Contact Us
