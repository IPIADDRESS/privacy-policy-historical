        <h2>Terms for Hosts</h2>
        <h4 class="padding-t-20">I.	BINDING AGREEMENT</h4><br>
        <p>A.	These Terms of Service (this "Agreement") constitute a binding and enforceable agreement between the Event Host and Greenvelope.  Please read this Agreement carefully.</p>
        <p>B.	For purposes of this Agreement, each person or entity hosting, producing, selling tickets for an event or service for which tickets are sold or to which invitations are issued (each an "Event"), and each of their authorized agents or service providers, shall be an "Event Host."  Each person purchasing a ticket to an event through Greenvelope for the Event shall be a "Purchaser."  Each person to receive an invitation to an Event shall be a "Guest."  </p>
        <p>C.	Greenvelope, LLC ("Greenvelope") provides web-based ticketing and invitation and attendance management services to Event Hosts for Events.  Greenvelope is not affiliated with any Event Host and solely acts an intermediary between the Event Host and the Purchaser or Guest.  </p>
        <p>D.	This Agreement applies only to the specific Event which Event Host has engaged Greenvelope for ticketing or invitation and attendance management services, and any other events hosted or produced by Event Host shall be governed by a separate agreement.  </p>
        <h4>II.	EVENTS</h4><br>
        <p>A.	<u>Advertising</u>.  This Agreement does not create any obligation on the part of Greenvelope to sponsor, support, advertise, promote, or otherwise perform any action on behalf of the Event Host with respect to, or in furtherance of, any Event.  </p>
        <p>B.	<u>Use of Information</u>.  If Event Host chooses to enable a public event page for any Event, Greenvelope may, in its sole and absolute discretion, use information provided by Event Host regarding such Event in publically accessible information on the Greenvelope website and other marketing, promotion, and business development purposes.</p>
        <p>C.	<u>Limitation of Liability</u>. Greenvelope shall have no liability with regard to any Event for which it provides ticketing or invitation and attendance management services, except as specifically set forth in this Agreement.  Greenvelope’s total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the sum of all amounts actually received by it from Purchasers and Event Hosts.</p>
        <h4>III.	REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF EVENT HOST</h4><br>
        <p>A.	<u>Representations &amp; Warranties</u>.  Event Hosts agrees, and represents and warrants to Greenvelope that: </p>
        <ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Event Host is authorized to sell tickets or provide invitations to the Event.</li>
        <li>The number of tickets Event Host determines to sell, or invitations the Event Host reasonably believes will be accepted, for the Event is within the all applicable regulations and restrictions concerning the venue, including state, local and federal law and regulation, and any restrictions imposed by the Event venue.  </li>
        <li>Event Host is responsible for all state, local, federal and other taxes with respect to the Event and the sale of tickets therefore.  </li>
        <li>Event Host owns or is otherwise entitled to use, all material posted to the Greenvelope website by Event Host or provided to Greenvelope for any purpose, and the use of such material or information does not infringe on any patent, copyright, or other intellectual property right of any third party.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <h4>IV.	TICKET PRICING; FEES</h4><br>
        <p>A.	<u>Ticket Prices</u>.  Event host shall be solely responsible for setting the ticket price or prices for the Event. </p>
        <p>B.	<u>Service Fees</u>.  Event Host shall pay to Greenvelope the service fees set forth on the Pricing Schedule available at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.greenvelope.com/business-invitations#pricing">https://www.greenvelope.com/business-invitations#pricing</a>.  In the case of Events for which Event Host retains Greenvelope to provide invitation and attendance management services, Event Host shall pay the service fees in advance. </p>
        <h4>V.	CAPACITY; INVITATIONS; REFUNDS</h4><br>
        <p>A.	<u>Capacity</u>.  Event Host shall determine, for each Event, the number of tickets available for purchase or invitations to be extended.  Event Host is solely responsible for this determination and Greenvelope shall have no liability for oversold tickets or excess invitations, or to any attendee at an Event, to any venue, or to any other party with regard to tickets sold or invitations extended beyond the legal capacity of any venue.</p>
        <p>B.	<u>Refunds</u>.</p>
        <ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li><u><b>ALL SALES ARE FINAL</b></u>.  In the event that any ticket purchased by a Purchaser is unusable by such Purchaser because of the over-sale of tickets or the cancellation of the Event, or if the Event is rescheduled or moved to a new venue, Event Host agrees to be fully and solely responsible to Purchaser for any refunds or ticket exchanges, and Greenvelope shall have no liability or obligation in connection therewith.  Greenvelope will not be obligated to issue refunds to any Event Host purchasing invitation and attendance management services for any reason.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <h4>VI.	UNLIMITED MEMBERSHIP USE</h4><br>
        <p>A.	Event hosts purchasing an annual unlimited membership are able to create unlimited mailings/events as long as each mailing is unique in nature. Cloning and creating a mailing/event in order to get around purchasing a larger package will flag your account for review. Continuing to behave in this manner will be deemed abusive and cause suspension of your account without refund. </p>
