		<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Greta Themes we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>
<p>It is Greta Themes’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Greta Themes collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Greta Themes’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Greta Themes’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Greta Themes may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Greta Themes also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blog. Greta Themes only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to Greta Themes’s websites choose to interact with Greta Themes in ways that require Greta Themes to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Greta Themes gathers depend on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who purchase a product at <a href="http://gretathemes.com">gretathemes.com</a> to provide their name, a username, and an email address. Greta Themes collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Greta Themes. Greta Themes does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Greta Themes may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Greta Themes may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Greta Themes does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Greta Themes discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Greta Themes’s behalf or to provide services available at Greta Themes’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Greta Themes’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Greta Themes will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Greta Themes discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Greta Themes believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Greta Themes, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Greta Themes website and have supplied your email address, Greta Themes may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Greta Themes and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Greta Themes takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Greta Themes uses cookies to help Greta Themes identify and track visitors, their usage of Greta Themes website, and their website access preferences. Greta Themes visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Greta Themes’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Greta Themes’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>If Greta Themes, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Greta Themes goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that are transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that any acquirer of Greta Themes may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Greta Themes may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Greta Themes’s sole discretion. Greta Themes encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
