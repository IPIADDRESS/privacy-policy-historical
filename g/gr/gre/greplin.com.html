<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h2>

treats personal information that it collects and receives on Greplin.com or through our service. We are not and
never will be in the business of selling information about you: we use information shared with us for the sole
purpose of running and improving our services. This notice tells you what information we collect, steps we take
to protect and secure it, how we use and share information, and finally, how you can contact us with questions
or concerns.</p>

been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe's program requirements including transparency, accountability
and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. TRUSTe's mission, as an independent

We use this information for the purpose of ensuring only you have access to your account.</li>
<li><b>Third party authentication</b> - When you add a service to Greplin, we use a technology called OAuth to
authorize Greplin to access that account. OAuth is a secure protocol that gives us access to your data
without actually giving us your password. You can revoke OAuth access either within Greplin or within the
third party service.</li>
<li><b>Third party data</b> - For each of the services you authorize Greplin to access, we create an index of
data from that service. This allows us to provide search functionality for your data. Data collected may

contacts. Social network data may include information you have entered on that site including your age,
city, hobbies, etc.</li>
<li><b>Cookies</b> - We send HTTP cookies to your browser or device to keep you logged in, when you choose. We
also use cookies to better understand how users interact with Greplin.</li>

please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or
destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.</li>

<p>If Greplin learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can
take appropriate protective steps. By using Greplin or providing personal information to us you agree that we
