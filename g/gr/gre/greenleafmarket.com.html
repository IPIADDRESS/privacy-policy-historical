<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how your information is
protected, collected and used. Updates may be made periodically. Any changes
will be posted on Local Dirt and Local Dirt will provide notice of materially
significant changes to this Privacy Policy by posting notice on Local Dirt.</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance for new
users and is otherwise effective on June 1, 2009.</p>

	<h1>Privacy</h1>
  <p>We see privacy as a basic Community principle. Out of
respect for your privacy, Local Dirt does not: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Place monitoring devices onto your computer such as web beacons, or single-pixel gifs. </li>
  <li>Sell or distribute a member's information to third parties for marketing purposes. </li>
  <li>Send unsolicited communications for marketing purposes. </li>
  <li>Run banner ads, pop ups, pop unders, or any other kind of commercial ads. </li>
  <li>Engage in cross-marketing or link-referral programs with other sites. </li>
</ul>

  <h1>Use</h1>
  <p>Our goal when collecting information is to provide users
with a convenient, efficient, and safe experience. You agree that your personal
information may be used to provide the services you request, provide customer
support, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, collect fees, prevent illegal
activities, enforce our <a href="#" onclick="staticPageLink('terms__conditions-a295.html'); return false;">User Agreement</a>, and improve our services. </p>

<h1>Collection</h1>

<p>You are welcome to browse Local Dirt without telling us who
you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us
your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to
provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage
of that information to our servers located in the United States. We may collect
and store the following personal information: </p>

<ul>
<li>Email address, physical contact information. </li>
<li>Transactional
information based on your activities on Local Dirt (such as buying, selling,
products and content you generate or that relates to your account).
</li><li>Community
discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through Local Dirt, and
correspondence sent to us. 
</li><li>Computer
sign-on data, statistics on page views, traffic to and from Local Dirt, ad data,
and other information, including IP address and standard web log information. 
</li><li>Supplemental
information submitted for verification or requested if site policies are
suspected to be violated (for example, if we ask for cooperative status
verification).
</li><li>Supplemental
information from third parties (for example, rating feedback).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h1>Our Disclosure of Your Information</h1>
<p>We may disclose personal information to respond to legal
requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other
content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or
safety. We may also share your personal information with: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Service providers under
     contract who help with our business operations (such as fraud
     investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs and
     co-branded credit cards). </li>
  <li>Other third parties to
     whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are
     otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific
     service). </li>
  <li>Law enforcement or other
     governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating to a
     criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other business entities, should we plan to merge with, or be
acquired by that business entity. </p>
<p>Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your
privacy and our ability to keep the Community free from wrongdoing, we will not
otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other
government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or
substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith
that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical
harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity. </p><h1>Information You Share on Local Dirt</h1>
<p>Your business name is displayed throughout Local Dirt (and
so available to the public), and is connected to all of your Local Dirt
activity. Other people can see your items for sale, Profile Page, ratings, feedback
and associated comments. Notices sent to other Community members about
suspicious activity and policy violations on our site refer to your business
name and specific item listings. So if you associate your name with your business,
the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally
identify your Local Dirt activities. </p>
<p>If you access our site from a shared computer or a computer
in an internet caf√©, certain information about you, such as your email address,
activity or reminders from Local Dirt, may also be visible to other individuals
who use the computer after you.</p>

<h1><a name="Cookies">Cookies </a></h1>
<p>We use "cookies" (small files placed on your hard
drive) on certain of our pages to help analyze our web page flow; customize our
services, content and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness; and
promote trust and safety.</p>
<p>A few important things you should know about cookies are
that: </p>
<ul>
<li>We use cookies to help identify you and maintain
your signed-in status. 
</li><li>Most cookies are "session cookies,"
meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of
a session. 
</li><li>You are always free to decline our cookies if
your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of our site
or services. 
</li><li>You may encounter cookies from third parties on
certain pages of the site that we do not control. (For example, if you view a
web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web
page.) </li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="Spam"></a>No Spam, Spyware or Spoofing</h1>
<p>Local Dirt and our users do not tolerate spam. You are not
licensed to add other Local Dirt users, even a user who has purchased an item
from you, to your mailing list (email or physical mail) without their express
consent. To report Local Dirt-related spam or spoof emails, please <a href="#" onclick="staticPageLink('contact_us-a194.html'); return false;">contact us</a>. You may not
use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would
violate our <a href="#" onclick="staticPageLink('terms__conditions-a295.html'); return false;">User Agreement</a>.
We automatically scan and may manually filter messages to check for spam,
viruses, phishing attacks and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited
content, but we do not permanently store messages sent through these tools. If
you send an email to an email address that is not registered in our Community
(via Refer-a-Friend or other tools), we do not permanently store that email or
use that email address for any marketing purpose. We do not rent or sell these
email addresses. </p>

<h1><a name="Protection"></a>Account Protection </h1>
<p>Your password is the key to your account. Use unique
numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose your password to
anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others,
remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your
account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control
over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions
taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any
reason, you should immediately notify Local Dirt and change your password. </p>

<h1><a name="Accessing"></a>Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal
Information </h1>
<p>You can see, review and change most of your personal
information by becoming a member of Local Dirt. Generally, we will not manually
modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your
identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it
changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may not be able
to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close your account and
remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible,
based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do
retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent
fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist
with any investigations, enforce our <a href="#" onclick="staticPageLink('terms__conditions-a295.html'); return false;">User Agreement</a> and take other actions otherwise permitted by
law.</p>

<h1><a name="Security"></a>Security </h1>
<p>Your information is stored on our servers located in the
United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of
tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal
information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you
probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions
or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal
information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very
hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect,
that your personal information or private communications will always remain
private. </p>

<h1><a name="Third"></a>Third Parties</h1>
<p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy
Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we
collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are
buyers or sellers on our site or other sites throughout the internet, different
rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to
them. Local Dirt does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and
you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where
applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal
information to others. </p>
<p>Our web site may contain hyperlinks or "links" to
and from other web sites.&nbsp; These web sites may have privacy policies that
differ from our Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Our Privacy Policy applies solely to our
web site.&nbsp; Please review the online privacy policies of any other web
sites that you visit.&nbsp; These links do not imply any affiliation between
Local Dirt and the owners of other web sites, or any endorsement, approval or
verification of any content contained on other web sites.</p>

<h1><a name="General"></a>General </h1>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the
amended terms on this site. All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days
after they are initially posted on the site. In addition, we will notify you
through a Local Dirt Message. If you have further questions, you may <a href="#" onclick="staticPageLink('contact_us-a194.html'); return false;">contact us</a> online.</p>
