        <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">Great Inspirational Quotes
        website strives to offer its visitors 
          the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive 
          and personalized experience.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, 
          e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms 
          of this privacy policy.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address 
          to any unauthorized third party. Period.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font face="Courier New">How we gather information from users</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">How we collect and store information depends on the page 
          you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and 
          the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information 
          when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request 
          certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You 
          may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, 
          message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site.</font> 
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">Like most websites, Great
        Inspirational Quotes website also 
          collects information automatically and through the use of electronic 
          tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log 
          the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology 
          to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, 
          the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having 
          to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the 
          number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting 
          our site.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather 
          information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not 
          to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser 
          to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access 
          certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name 
          and password, and we may not be able to customize the site as features 
          according to your preferences.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font face="Courier New">What we do with the information we collect</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">Like other web publishers, we collect information to enhance 
          your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. 
          We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">Aggregated Information (information that does not personally 
          identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine 
          information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained 
          from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn 
          which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive).</font> 
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with 
          our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does 
          not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow 
          anyone to identify you individually.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected 
          on Great Inspirational Quotes website to communicate with you about your registration 
          and customization preferences; our privacy policy; services and products 
          offered by Great Inspirational Quotes website, and other topics we think you 
          might find of interest.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">Personally Identifiable Information collected by
        Great Inspirational Quotes website may also be used for other purposes, including but 
          not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce 
          transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other 
          communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical 
          support for the operation of our site (our web hosting service for example) 
          may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted 
          by law.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop 
          our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies 
          or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the 
          transferred assets.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">We may also disclose your information in response to a 
          court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required 
          to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may 
          owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it 
          appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice 
          prior to disclosure in such cases.</font></p>
