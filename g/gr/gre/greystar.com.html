            <p><b>This Privacy Policy was last updated: October 23, 2015</b></p>
            <p>Greystar® (referred to herein as "Greystar", "we", "us", or "our" herein) recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of individual-specific information ("Information") collected about our residents and prospective residents (referred to as "Residents", "you" or "your"). This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how you can correct or change it. It is our intention to give you as much control over your personal data as possible to preserve your privacy, while still allowing us to utilize that Information in the course of our business to provide you a valuable service.
			</p>
			<p>This Privacy Policy constitutes an integral part of our website’s Terms of Use and is subject to the provisions thereof, including with respect to Limitation of Liability and governing law. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy before you send or share information with us or use our website and to read it again when we notify you of changes to the Privacy Policy that are made from time to time. Greystar complies with the U.S. EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S. Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Greystar has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. Please see our Safe Harbor Statement by clicking <a href="safeharbor-privacy.html" target="_blank"> here</a>. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Greystar’s certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.</p>
			<h3 class="main-header">What personally identifying information does Greystar collect?</h3>
			<p>Your name and address, age or date of birth, your email address, number of individuals in your household and
				their ages, your occupation, employment information, telephone number, education, the kind of service
				provided to you, your Social Security number, bank account number, debit card number, bank or investment
				account, debit card, or credit card balance, payment history, and information pertaining to your
				creditworthiness, assets, income or liabilities.
			</p>
			<p>If you are applying for employment at Greystar, these additional categories of information will also be deemed to be Personal Information: </p>
			<ul class="bullet-list">
				<li>Race</li>
				<li>Credit checks</li>
				<li>Background report</li>
				<li>Results of drug screenings</li>
				<li>Employment verification</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="main-header">Usage Tracking: Use of IP Addresses </h3>
			<p>An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Internet.
				Web servers, the main computers that serve up web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP
				address. Greystar collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, reporting aggregated
				information, and to audit the use of our site. When Residents request pages from the Greystar site, our servers
				log the Residents' IP addresses.
			</p>
			<p>We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a Resident's session
				will be logged, but the Resident remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a
				Resident when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to
				protect our service, site, residents or others from potential harm.
			 </p>

			<h3 class="main-header">Use of "Cookies"</h3>
			<p>Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual for record­keeping purposes. Cookies
				make web surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you are at our site. The use of cookies is an
				industry standard, and as such, you'll find them at most major websites. By showing how and when Residents
				use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to
				the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily
				tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies only to provide services better tailored to our
				Residents' needs. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies.
			</p>

			<h3 class="main-header">What Information Do We Share or Disclose?</h3>
			<p>As a general rule, Greystar will not disclose personal Information except when we have your permission or under
				special circumstances, such as when we believe, in good faith, that the law requires it or under the
				circumstances described below.
			</p>
			<p>We do not commercialize or share any personally identifying information with third parties, unless: </p>
			<ul class="bullet-list">
				<li>Such information is shared and/or commercialized following receipt of a specific request and/or permission from users; </li>
				<li>Such information is shared with affiliated companies and/or potential investors (in any form of business transaction, including purchase or merger) pursuant to an agreement which contains reasonable confidentiality arrangements; </li>
				<li>Such information is shared with contractors who work with us (in order to facilitate our business) pursuant to an agreement which contains reasonably confidentiality arrangements;</li>
				<li>Such information is shared in order to comply with or in accordance with any applicable law and/or court orders and/or in order to prevent suspected illegal acts, frauds, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law; </li>
				<li>Such information is shared in order to help Greystar defend against claims and/or establish or exercise any legal right that Greystar may have; </li>
				<li>Such information is shared in order to help Greystar prevent violations of Greystar’s Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy or to otherwise protect the rights, property, or safety of Greystar employees or resident, or others, including exchanging information with third parties for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. </li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="main-header">Business Transitions</h3>
			<p>In the event that Greystar goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another
				company, or selling all or part of its assets, users' personally identifying information will, in most instances, be
				part of the assets transferred.
			</p>

			<h3 class="main-header">Third-Party Site Links</h3>
			<p>You should be aware that when you are on the Greystar website you could be directed to other sites that are
				beyond our control. There are links to other sites from Greystar, which take you outside our service. For
				example, if you "click" on an advertisement or a search result, the "click" may take you off the Greystar
				site. These other sites may include sites of other advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use their logo as
				part of a co­branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to visitors to collect data or
				solicit information. Greystar does not control such sites, and, therefore, is not responsible for their content.
				The inclusion of hyperlinks to any other sites by Greystar does not imply any endorsement of the material on such
				sites, nor any association with their operators. Greystar policies do not extend to anything that is inherent in
				the operation of the Internet, which is beyond our control. Remember that whenever you give out Information
				online, that information may be collected and used by people you don't know. While Greystar strives to protect
				your information and therein your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any Information you.
			</p>

			<h3 class="main-header">Securing Information</h3>
			<p>Greystar takes reasonable measures in order to safeguard users' personally identifying information.  </p>
			<p>Payment information (such as credit card number and/or Social Security number) and information about the security vulnerability of users' website is protected, by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the aforementioned information when viewed online.</p>
			<p>While on a secured page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when users are just surfing. </p>
			<p>In addition, we limit access to personally identifying information to employees who we believe reasonably need to receive such information to provide our Services or in order to do their jobs and take other precautions we deem reasonable to protect the security of users' personally identifying information. </p>
			<p>However, users should be aware that we cannot fully guarantee the security of their personally identifying information. As in many computer systems, internet applications and software programs, unauthorized use, failure of hardware or software, etc. may be injurious to the confidentiality of users' personally identifying information.  </p>
			<p>If users have any questions about security, please contact us. </p>

			<h3 class="main-header">Encryption</h3>
			<p>We have put in place encryption software, which fully encrypts or distorts all data you submit to us through the
				use of the Online Rental Application ("Items"). This encryption will be processed at 256 bits, making it a difficult
				code to hack into without the appropriate decoding software. Your personal data is immediately encrypted as
				you send it to us, and we then decode the encrypted data and use the converted data to process the
				aforementioned Items. We also work very hard to ensure that our employees are aware of the sensitivity of the
				data submitted to us and that they handle it with care, being careful not to allow any improper access by third
				parties.
			</p>
			<p>Because the security of all Information associated with our residents is of utmost concern to us, we periodically
				review and improve our security and privacy policies as necessary when new technology becomes available. We
				exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your Information from your PC to our servers.
				Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. As
				a result, while we strive to protect your Information, Greystar Software can't ensure or warrant the security of
				any information you transmit to us online, and you, therefore, do so at your own risk. Once we receive your
				transmission, we use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your Information, such as
				firewalls and Secure Socket Layers, and our encryption techniques, as well. It is important, however, to
				remember that, despite these state of the art precautions, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
			</p>

			<h3 class="main-header">Email Consent and Opt-Out</h3>
			<p>Your provision of personal information through any of our resident portal Sites constitutes your affirmative
				consent that we may contact you by email to provide you with information and notices relating to the property
				where you reside, and various services available to you at or through that property.
			</p>

			<p>You may choose to opt out of receiving future commercial email messages from us. Each mass commercial email
				sent by us contains a link with instructions on how to remove yourself from our email list. Please note that if you
				are a resident of a Greystar community and you opt out of receiving commercial email from us, you will continue
				to receive email from us regarding operational issues surrounding your apartment, your lease, and/or your
				community.
			</p>

			<h3 class="main-header">Children's Privacy</h3>
			<p>We do not collect or maintain information at our site from those we know are under 13, and we do not permit children under 13 years of age to become registered users of our Site. No part of our site is structured to attract anyone under 13. By using our site you represent that you are not under 13 years of age.</p>

			<h3 class="main-header">Non-U.S. Residents</h3>
			<p>If you do not reside in the U.S. and are visiting our site, if you provide personal information to us it may be
				transferred to and processed on computers in the U.S. and other countries. Do not provide your personal
				information to us if you do not want this information to be transferred outside of your country, or if the laws in
				your country restrict these types of transfers. Your provision of personal information to us will be handled in
				accordance with this Privacy Policy. From time to time, your personal information may be transferred to a
				country different from where you are located, and processed there in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You
				hereby consent to such transfers and processing as described in this Privacy Policy, except in the case of data
				transfers from the European Economic Area or Switzerland, which are covered under the U.S.­EU Safe Harbor
				Framework and U.S.­Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, as described in the Greystar <a href="safeharbor-privacy.html" target="_blank">Safe Harbor Privacy Policy: </a>.
			</p>

			<h3 class="main-header">Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</h3>
			<p>If a user's personally identifying information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifying information. This can usually be done at the Registered User account settings page or by emailing our Digital Marketing Department through digitalmarketing@greystar.com.</p>

			<p>When a request for user deletion is received, we will make all reasonable efforts to purge said data from our systems. However, due to the nature of our service, some information may not be fully removed due to backups or archived copies.</p>

			<h3 class="main-header">Notification of Changes</h3>
			<p>If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places
				we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under
				what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under
				which the information was collected.
			</p>

			<h3 class="main-header">Contact Information</h3>
			<p>If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy including privacy, information use, collection, or security please contact us.</p>

			<h3 class="main-header">Acceptance of these Terms</h3>
			<p>By using this site, or providing information to us, you signify your agreement to our Privacy Policy. If you do not
				agree with this policy, please do not use this site. In addition, your continued use of our site following the
				posting of changes to these terms will also signify your acceptance of those changes.
