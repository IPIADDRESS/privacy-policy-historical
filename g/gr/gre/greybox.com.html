<h3 id="the-full-detailed-privacy-policy">The Full Detailed Privacy Policy</h3>
<p><a name="s1"><strong>1.   What Information Does the Service Collect?</strong></a> </p>
<p><a name="s1a"><strong>(a) Information You Provide to Us</strong></a>
<strong>Personal Information and Demographic Information.</strong>  On the Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and/or last name, e-mail address, and home address (<strong>“Personal Information"</strong>); and (2) demographic information, such as information about your gender, your type of business, age, marital status, income or revenues, education level, and occupation (<strong>“Demographic Information"</strong>).  We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Service, including account registration forms, contact us forms, or when you otherwise interact with the Service.  To the extent we combine Demographic Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.  </p>
<p><a name="s1b"><strong>(b) Information Collected or Stored As You Access and Use the Service</strong></a> </p>
<p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Service, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Service (<strong>“Usage Information"</strong>).  This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “Device") whenever you visit or interact with our Service.  To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat it as Personal Information.  </p>
<p>This Usage Information may include:</p>
<p>•   your IP address, UDID or other unique identifier (<em>“Device Identifier"</em>).  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Service, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;</p>
<p>•   your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);</p>
<p>•   the URL that referred you to our Service;</p>
<p>•   the areas within our Service that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences;</p>
<p>•   your Device location;</p>
<p>•   your Device characteristics; and</p>
<p>•   certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.  </p>
<p><strong>Tracking Technologies.</strong>  We may use various methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (<strong>“Tracking Technologies"</strong>).  Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device.  A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):</p>
<p><strong>Cookies.</strong>  A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Service.  A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device.  HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage.</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons.</strong>  Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs" or “clear GIFs") may be included in our Service's pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.  </p>
<p><strong>Embedded Scripts.</strong>  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.  </p>
<p><strong>Browser Fingerprinting.</strong>  Collection and analysis of information from your Device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.<br>
ETag, or Entity Tag.  A feature of the cache in browsers.  It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.  If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned.  Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier.  ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.  </p>
<p><strong>Recognition Technologies.</strong>  Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices in the same user).</p>
<p><strong>Location-identifying Technologies.</strong>  Additionally, the Services may use GPS (global positioning systems) software and other location-based technologies such as iBeacons to locate you so we may verify your location, deliver you relevant content based on your location, as well as allow you to share your location to other users as part of the services we provide via the Services.  Upon downloading the App, we provide location-based services to your approximate and/or exact location information.  In addition, to traditional GPS location-based services, some of the retailers and others we work with may install low power Bluetooth, wifi, radio transmitters, or other devices in physical locations, which emit a signal that the App can detect to pinpoint your location or otherwise interact with the App (<strong>“iBeacons"</strong>).  Because iBeacons are more precise than GPS, we can improve the Services such as to send you more specific and relevant messages and offers.  In addition, you may be able to send your location information via the Services to other Services users.  You should consider the pros and cons involved in disclosing your location information to us and to other people.  Where a user of the Services requests that their location information be revealed to other persons, the user will be provided options for managing sharing services, which may be through third party services such as through Twitter and Facebook.  We are not responsible for the acts, omissions or policies of such third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking Technologies Usage.</strong>  We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
<p><em>Strictly Necessary.</em>  We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our Service, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of shopping cart functionality.  </p>
<p><em>Performance Related.</em>  We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Service, including as part of our analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered through the Service.  </p>
<p><em>Functionality Related.</em>  We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are required to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing the Service, including identifying you when you sign in to our Service or keeping track of our specified preferences, including in terms of the presentation of content on our Service.  </p>
<p><em>Targeting Related.</em>  We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on our Service and third party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements or content.  This includes using Tracking Technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements and content that may be delivered to you.  Further information on this, and your opt-out choices, is found in <a href="#s6">Section 6</a> below.  </p>
<p><em>Tracking Technologies Choices and Consent.</em></p>
<p>We obtain your consent to our information storage or collection Tracking Technologies by providing you with transparent information in our Privacy Policy and providing you with the opportunity to make a choice to disable cookies as set forth below.  Please note that we are not required to obtain your consent to the information collection Tracking Technologies identified above that are strictly necessary.  If you are a resident of Europe, you may have the right to object to other use of information storage or collection technologies – further information on this right for marketing-related purposes is found in <a href="#s3j">Section 3 (j)</a> below.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Tracking and Do Not Track.</strong></p>
<p>There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Service.  Further, third parties may use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Service, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services.  We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them.  However, you consent to potentially encountering third party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Service and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.  For more information on our vendors, and their Tracking Technologies, click <a href="#s3b">here</a>.  For more information on advertising and advertisers, and related Tracking Technologies, click <a href="#s6">here</a>.  Also, various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services (e.g., browser do not track signals).  Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms.  For more information on third party programs that may permit you to exercise choice regarding targeted advertising based on such information, click <a href="#s6">here</a>.

<p>Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.  Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard.  Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies or other Tracking Technologies.  For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe's website <a href="http://www.adobe.com">www.adobe.com</a>.  Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies some parts of our Services may not work and that when you revisit our Services your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.  Further, App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of the App) can only be disabled by uninstalling the App.  To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer.</p>
<p><a name="s1c"><strong>(c) Information Third Parties Provide About You</strong></a>
We may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Service, such as when they submit content to us or post on the Service.  Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Service with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you.  To the extent we combine information we receive from those sources with your Personal Information we collect on the Service, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise.   In no other circumstances do our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.  </p>
<p><a name="s1d"><strong>(d) Interactions with Third-Party Services</strong></a>
The Service may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and a third-party web site or application.  The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us.  For example, when you register with the Service, you may have an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account provided by a third-party site or application to facilitate the registration and log-in or transaction process on the Service, or otherwise link accounts.  If we offer and you choose to use this functionality to access or use our Service, the third-party site or application may send Personal Information about you to us.  If so, we will then treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on our Service.  In addition, we may provide third-party sites' interfaces or links on the Service to facilitate your sending a communication from the Service.  For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings.

<p><a name="s5"><strong>5.   Do Third-Party Content, Links To Third-Party Sites, and/or Third-Party Apps Appear on the Service?</strong></a>
The Service may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect Usage Information and your Device Identifier when pages from the Service are served to you.  In addition, when you are on the Service you may be directed to other services that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control.

<p><a name="s6"><strong>6.   Are Ads Served On the Service?</strong></a> </p>
<p>The Service does not use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements on the Service.</p>
<p>The Service may use third-party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of the Service and viewing of our content.  Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your visits to the Service and other apps and sites you have visited.  Third-party ad serving enables advertisers to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.  </p>
<p>The Service's third-party exchange providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies (including Flash cookies), web beacons and other Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier.  These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.  You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations.  Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.  </p>
<p>Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they use our technology to help store or collect data.  Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third-party advertisers and others or the use of the information that such third parties collect.  We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice.  The relevant third party's terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices.  We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.  </p>
<p>However, some may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available here.  Further, while we do not currently serve advertisements on the Service, you may wish to visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the “opt-out" procedures of NAI members.  Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver targeted content and/or ads to you, which will affect this and other sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads.  Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.  Additional information is available on the NAI's web site accessible by the above link.  You may also opt-out of receiving third-party behavioral ads on sites by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA") web site at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed</a>.
