	<h3><a name="what-personally-identfiable-information">What Personally Identifiable Information Is Collected and How It is Collected</a></h3>

<p>
	Personally identifiable information, or personal information, is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you either online or offline. Grey Box collects personal information when you register and create a user account in order to access certain content and/or utilize aspects of the Services. Grey Box may also collect personally identifiable information during the course of your use of the Services and/or in connection with marketing or email campaigns. We do not require, as a condition of participation in any of our Services, that anyone disclose more information than is reasonably necessary for them to participate in an activity.
</p>
<p>
	The type of personally identifiable information collected will vary depending upon the activity and may include your first and last name; e-mail address; account information for certain third party third party sites or networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, phone numbers; mailing address; and zip code. We will also collect the contact information of your friends, if you choose to connect your contacts and address book information with Grey Box, and/or if you choose to connect those accounts with your Grey Box account your login credentials to your social network accounts, such as Facebook and Twitter.
</p>
<p>
	We also may automatically collect certain information when you use our Services, such as a device identifier (but not the UDID), MAC address, Internet Protocol (IP) address (if using a browser), operating system, computer type, software, Internet IP address, the browser type, the address of a referring site and your activity on Grey Box. You can enable or disable location services when you use Grey Box at any time, through your browser settings.

</p>
<p>
	At any time, but only once per calendar year, or as otherwise required under applicable law, you may contact Grey Box to review the personally identifiable information that Grey Box has collected about you.

</p>

	<h3><a name="cookies-and-other-tracking">Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</a></h3>

<p>
	We use "cookies" on this website. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a website visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our website and identify repeat visitors to our website. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our website. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website and provide support for the internal operations of the website or some of our online services including apps. Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information on our website.
</p>
<p>
	Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can, however, reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please consult the technical information relevant to your browser for instructions. If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept a cookie, some parts of the Service may not function properly or may be considerably slower.

<p>
	We may also use other tracking technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, or other web programming code from time to time. Such technologies may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Such technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the service, to monitor how users navigate the service, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. Such technologies may also enable us to send email messages in a format users can read, tell us whether mail has been opened, and ultimately allow us to reduce or eliminate messages sent to users. We treat information collected by or from such technologies as non-personal information. To the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers may be considered personal information by local law, however, we treat such information as personal information. To the extent that non-personal information may also be combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
</p>

	<h3><a name="children">Children</a></h3>

<p>
	We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from someone we know to be a child under the age of thirteen (13) without prior parental consent. IF YOU ARE 13 YEARS OLD OR YOUNGER, Grey Box REQUESTS THAT YOU NOT SUBMIT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE SERVICES OR TO Grey Box. Our websites and application do contain features that may be attractive to children, however, and children should not be granted access to any passwords or use of the parent or guardian's account without direct monitoring and supervision by the parent or guardian. Grey Box is not responsible for any unauthorized use of accounts, and we encourage everyone to protect their passwords and not disclose them to anyone. If Grey Box discovers that a child age 13 or younger has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete that child's personally identifiable information from our records.<strong></strong>
</p>

	<h3><a name="personally-identfiable-information">How Personally Identifiable Information is Used</a></h3>

<p>
	We will only collect information to the extent necessary for us to provide our Services.

<p>
	The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to attempt to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access and improper use. However, please understand that no security measure is perfect or impenetrable and therefore we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personally identifiable information.

You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.

	Please note that Grey Box does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure.
