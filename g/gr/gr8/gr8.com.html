We may also transfer that information or data to companies controlled by or under common Control with GetResponse, contractors or others, in the United States or elsewhere. In each case, we will do so only to the extent necessary to provide you the Service, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

                        <p>Additionally, your own transfer or processing of Contacts personal information or data may be subject to protection under Applicable Privacy Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, it is important to note that if you or your Contacts are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), or you use the Service to send emails to anyone in the EEA, then your processing of their personal data or information may be subject to protection under General Data Protection Regulation.

                        <h3>Erasure of Processed Data</h3>
                        <p>If you are our Customer, we store your Personal Data for the time during which you have an Account with our Service.
