                                        <p><strong>Meet Maggie:</strong>&nbsp;To show how information is collected on our Websites and across the internet, we’ll use Maggie as example. Maggie will help show one person’s journey on the web, and how we help make her online experience more meaningful and relevant.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Maggie is a 42 year-old mother of three who lives in a small town on Long Island, New York. Maggie likes to shop, research, and read content online, particularly about her gardening hobby. She uses email and social media and enjoys receiving advertising relevant to her interests, so she can learn about new products and ideas. However, Maggie is concerned about her privacy and what data and information is collected about her. She often wonders how her computer knows she likes gardening when she sees gardening ads, even when she is not on a website about gardening. The privacy principles below will help Maggie and others better understand just that. The principles explain who GroupM is and how we collect and use information in connection with the GroupM.com Website and GroupM Services.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>GroupM is a leading global media investment and media agency holding company. We focus on media buying and media strategy, and we continually evaluate innovative ways to deliver relevant advertising and custom online experiences on behalf of our clients. Protecting online user privacy in the course of our business is a priority and one we take very seriously. GroupM provides client services such as media planning and buying; marketing communications planning; campaign analytics and research; paid search placement and search engine optimization; and branded entertainment and sports sponsorships (“Services”).</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Remember Maggie and her gardening hobby? With Interest Based Advertising (IBA) technology, (also known as behavioral advertising or audience buying), Maggie will see more gardening ads online because she visits many gardening websites and reads a lot of online&nbsp;<a title="Information made available by a website or other electronic medium. For example, online videos or other web articles." href="#" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-toggle="tooltip">content</a>&nbsp;about gardening. If our client is a Brand that sells gardening tools, GroupM’s Services will help place ads on sites where people who like gardening, like Maggie, will see them.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>When Maggie visits websites, watches videos online, or clicks on ads, we store a number on her browser using a “cookie” to remember her visits. &nbsp;Accomplished with partners (digital publishers such as online gardening magazines, for example), this cookie (number) will never collect personal information (PII) about Maggie, similar to how explained above. &nbsp;More on this a bit later…</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Because many websites Maggie visits are related to gardening, the anonymous number which identifies her machine or device is put in the “gardening enthusiast” interest category. As a result, we may show Maggie ads that are relevant to gardening enthusiasts as she browses websites. This is how we use information collected about Maggie through the cookie (number). This is an industry standard approach; you can learn more about these practices at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iab.net/privacymatters">www.iab.net/privacymatters</a>. Remember the cookie does not tell us who Maggie is specifically. All we know is that someone used that particular device to view a gardening website. We tag the device with the cookie so we can later serve more gardening ads to that device.</p>

                                        <p>Through the process described above, we do not collect any of her PII and do not know Maggie’s name or any other personal information. We simply recognize the cookie (number) stored in her browser which tells us someone likes gardening websites. We then show Maggie ads related to interests in gardening and based on inferred demographics associated with gardening. We will never show ads based on sensitive information categories such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or sensitive financial categories.</p>

By sharing Maggie’s Non-PII with our clients and vendors, the information helps them deliver more tailored ads to potential customers. The non-personal information allows clients to best understand what ads Maggie likes most based on how she interacts with the ads and when. This also enables serving of personalized ads to Maggie’s devices so she sees ads relevant to her interests, hobbies and things she may be shopping for at the moment. This information also helps clients formulate more efficient ad campaigns which can help Maggie in the long run. We do not collect PII via our clients’ ads, except in instances where consent is given by you or you provide the PII voluntarily, and therefore, we do not sell, rent, or share personal information collected on GroupM.com or other websites with anyone other than as set forth in this Privacy Notice.</p>

                                        <p>GroupM is a leading global media investment and media agency holding company. We focus on media buying and media strategy, and we continually evaluate innovative ways to deliver relevant advertising and custom online experiences on behalf of our clients. Protecting online user privacy in the course of our business is a priority and one we take very seriously. &nbsp;GroupM provides client services such as media planning and buying; marketing communications planning; campaign analytics and research; paid search placement and search engine optimization; and branded entertainment and sports sponsorships (“Services”).</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p><strong>Don’t get it? Allow us to explain a bit more about our Services, how information is collected and used, and how you can prevent this information being collected should you choose to do so.</strong></p>

                                        <p><a title="Interest-Based Advertising is why you see ads that are relevant to you. With this type of advertising, advertisers collect information about your web browsing across some of the sites you visit. They then use this information to try to predict what ads might be the most interesting to you." href="#"><strong>Interest Based Advertising (IBA)</strong></a></p>
                                        <p>Let’s say you’re interested in gardening. &nbsp;With Interest Based Advertising (IBA) technology (also known as behavioral advertising or audience buying), you will see more gardening ads online because you visit many gardening websites and read a lot of online&nbsp;<a title="Information made available by a website or other electronic medium. For example, online videos or other web articles." href="#" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-toggle="tooltip">content</a>&nbsp;about gardening. If our client is a brand that sells gardening tools, GroupM’s services will help place ads on sites where people who like gardening will see them.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>When you visit websites, watch videos online, or clicks on ads, which GroupM has placed on behalf of its clients, we store a number in your browser using a “cookie” to remember the websites you visit and the ads you have clicked on. &nbsp;This is accomplished together with our partners (digital publishers such as online gardening magazines, for example). &nbsp;However, this cookie (number) will never collect your name, contact details or any similar information. &nbsp;More on this a bit later…</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Staying with our gardening example, because many websites you visit are related to gardening, the cookie (number) on your device is put in the “gardening enthusiast” interest category. As a result, we may show you ads that are relevant to gardening enthusiasts as you browse websites. This is how we use information collected about you through the cookie (number). This is an industry standard approach; you can learn more about these practices at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iab.net/privacymatters">www.iab.net/privacymatters</a>. Remember the cookie does not tell us your name, contact details or any similar information. All we know is that someone used that particular device to view a gardening website. We tag the device with the cookie so we can later serve more gardening ads to that device.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p><strong>What information do we collect?</strong></p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>As described above, we do not collect your name, contact details or any similar information through the use of cookies. We simply recognize the cookie (number) stored in your browser which tells us someone likes particular kinds of websites (gardening websites, in our example). We then show you ads related to interests in gardening and based on inferred demographics associated with gardening. We will never show ads based on sensitive information categories such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or sensitive financial information such as information that may be obtained from consumer credit reports.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Your information collected through our Services (or ads placed by us on behalf of clients) may be shared with our clients and vendors. &nbsp;This is essentially how we do business and is how online advertising works. It’s important to remember that this information does not include your name, contact details or any similar information. By sharing this information with our clients and vendors, the information helps them deliver more tailored ads to potential customers. The information allows clients to best understand what ads you like most based on how you interact with the ads and when. This also enables serving of personalized ads to your devices so you see ads relevant to your interests, hobbies and things you may be shopping for at the moment. This information also helps clients formulate more efficient ad campaigns which can help you in the long run. Again, we never collect names, contact details or similar information via our clients’ ads, and therefore, we cannot sell, rent, or share this information with anyone.</p>
