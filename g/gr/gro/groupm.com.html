<p>The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to provide clear notice about how GroupM Worldwide Inc., (“GroupM”) collects information from you and how we use it in connection with our Services and on <a href="http://www.GroupM.com">http://www.GroupM.com</a>, (“Site”). GroupM is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users and fostering user confidence in the Internet, Internet advertising and direct marketing. &nbsp;Accordingly, we are committed to observing applicable industry guidelines including those established and put forward by the DAA which is an alliance of industry groups including the Interactive Advertising Bureau, American Association of Advertising Agencies and Direct Marketing Association. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About GroupM</strong></p>
<p>GroupM has adopted these privacy principles for the website located at <a href="http://groupm.com">groupm.com</a>. This Privacy Policy applies only to the website on which it appears, and not to any other GroupM website or service. &nbsp;This Privacy Policy also provides information about activities we undertake across internet websites on behalf of GroupM clients.</p>
<p>We continually evaluate innovative ways to protect online user privacy while also seeking to deliver relevant advertising and custom online experiences on behalf of our clients. &nbsp;GroupM provides services for its clients such as media planning and buying, marketing communications planning, campaign analytics and research, paid search placement and search engine optimization, branded entertainment as well as sports sponsorships (“Services”).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information You Provide Us Through Your Correspondence on this Website</strong></p>
<p>It is extremely rare that we collect personal information. However, in the instance we do, the personal information we collect comes directly from our Site visitors. We collect personal information from our visitors in the following situations:</p>
<ul><li>When you submit inquiries through our “contact us” link on this website,</li>
<li>When a visitor signs up to receive our marketing emails or newsletters,</li>
<li>To submit information in connection with an employment inquiry,</li>
<li>When a visitor expressly enters information into a text field or otherwise submits information to us.</li>
</ul><p>We keep a record of the information you provide including your email address and any other Personally Identifying Information, (“PII”), you provide, solely for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or request. PII includes name, address, telephone number, email address, or any other data used or intended to be used to contact specific person.</p>
<p>We automatically receive Non-Personal Information (“Non-PII”) when you visit our Site. Non-PII is any information where on its own cannot be used to identify, contact, or precisely locate a particular individual. Non-PII includes&nbsp; your IP address (in the US), browser information, information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies, the date and time of your visit, and the web page you have visited immediately prior to visiting this Site, and more.</p>
<p>Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, this information will never be shared with third parties without your consent. GroupM may pass your PII to our subsidiaries and affiliated companies so that they may contact you in connection with your inquiry. PII passed on to a subsidiary or affiliate of GroupM in another country will receive protections in accordance with GroupM policies and local law. By using our Site you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may provide for different data protection rules and regulations than in your country.</p>
<p>GroupM may provide you with the ability to purchase or subscribe to certain services on the GroupM website for a fee. &nbsp;In such event, we will collect certain PII from you, including payment information, solely for the purpose of processing your purchase or subscription. &nbsp;In connection with such purchase or subscription, we may share your PII and payment information with our affiliates or vendors to the extent necessary to process your payment and deliver to you the products or services you have purchased.</p>
<p>If you would like us to remove your information from our marketing e-mails or newsletters, unsubscribe you from our database, or if you would like to change or correct any of your information, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@groupm.com">privacy@groupm.com</a>. &nbsp;Be sure to include your name, email address, and clear instructions regarding any changes you are requesting.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect Through our Services</strong></p>
<p>We do not collect PII from users online through advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients unless, in the rare instance, users affirmatively and deliberately choose to release that information by submitting it, in a text field for example. We do collect Non-PII to identify devices that we have interacted with before through advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients. For instance, by using Non-PII, we may be able to identify a device that has previously seen an advertisement we launched on behalf of a client. Devices include computers, mobile phones, tablets, e-readers, or other digital devices capable of maintaining an internet connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Use of information for Services</strong></p>
<p>As stated above, we may collect Non-PII regarding your web browsing, usage or interactions with advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients. &nbsp;Through the collection and use of Non-PII, we offer a range of Services to allow advertisers to show you the most useful and relevant online advertisements across numerous websites and to prevent excessive or repeated deliveries of the same advertisements. We do this to better customize the sort of advertisements you see on various websites and for other purposes such as research and analysis. &nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if we infer that a user is interested in apparel options, then our Services may help our clients deliver interest-based online advertisements to you about a particular type of apparel. You can learn more about such advertising practices by visiting&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iab.net/privacymatters">www.iab.net/privacymatters</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosures for Europe</strong></p>
<p>Please note – in Europe, an IP address is considered PII by applicable law. &nbsp;If we conduct business in such countries and we know that you are located in such a country, we will treat your IP address as PII.</p>
<p>In such countries we interpose a “black box” which is operated by an independent third party and which separates the user’s IP address from other data we collect. If your browser does not accept cookies or if the opt-out-cookie is set, no tracking takes place.</p>
<p>targ.ad is a service of ours which places a cookie on your computer for the purpose of interest-based marketing as described above. &nbsp;This service is primarily used Europe. &nbsp;The service has been certified with the Data Privacy Seal issued by the Independent Data Protection Authority of the Federal State Schleswig-Holstein in Germany in March 2010. &nbsp;You may opt-out of the targ.ad 2.0 cookie by <a href="#OptOut-button">clicking here</a></p>

The Google Analytics cookie remains on your computer after you close your browser; this type of cookie is known as a “persistent” cookie.</p>

<p>A link from our own website to another website does not imply our endorsement, or endorsement of our affiliates, of that website. &nbsp;We do not control the websites to which we link and assume no responsibility for their content or privacy policies. &nbsp;Once you link to another website the GroupM Privacy Policy does not apply.
