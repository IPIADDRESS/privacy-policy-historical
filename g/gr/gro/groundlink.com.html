        <h3><a name="rq">What Personal Information About Customers Does GroundLink.com Gather?</a></h3>

        <p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience
            at GroundLink.com. Here are the types of information we gather.
        </p><ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Information You Give Us: </strong>We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site
                or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not
                be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such
                purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our interface,
                and communicating with you.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Information: </strong>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you
                interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of
                information when your Web browser accesses GroundLink.com
            </li>
            <li><strong>E-mail Communications: </strong>To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often
                receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from GroundLink.com if your computer supports such
                capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to
                avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Information from Other Sources: </strong>We might receive information about you from other
                sources and add it to our account information.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <h3><a name="rq1">What About Cookies?</a></h3>

        <p>
        </p><ul class="list">
            <li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web
                browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser.
            </li>
            <li>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from
                accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
                disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser
                add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Website of its
                manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of GroundLink.com's essential
                features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our
                cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any
                GroundLink.com products and services that require you to Sign in.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <h3><a name="rq2">Does GroundLink.com Share the Information It Receives?</a></h3>

        <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of
            selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries
            GroundLink.com, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as
            protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
        </p><ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: </strong>We work closely with our affiliated
                businesses. In some cases, such as Marketplace and Auctions sellers, these businesses sell offerings to
                you at GroundLink.com. In other cases, we provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these
                businesses. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customer
                information related to those transactions with that third party.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers: </strong>We employ other companies and individuals to perform
                functions on our behalf. Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive
                information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search
                results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing
                customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may
                not use it for other purposes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Promotional Offers: </strong>Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of GroundLink.com
                customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and
                address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your Customer Communication
                Preferences.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers: </strong>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy
                stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of
                the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy
                Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that
                GroundLink.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course
                be one of the transferred assets.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Protection of GroundLink.com and Others: </strong>We release account and other personal information
                when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
                and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of GroundLink.com, our users, or others.
                This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and
                credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise
                disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of
                the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
            </li>
            <li><strong>With Your Consent: </strong>Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when
                information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share
                the information.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <h3><a name="rq3">How Secure Is Information About Me?</a></h3>

        <p>
        </p><ul class="list">
            <li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer
                (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
            </li>
            <li>We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we
                transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
            </li>
            <li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be
                sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <h3><a name="rq4">What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?</a></h3>

        <p>Our site may include third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any personally
            identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites.</p>

        <p>These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf,
            sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our website directly to your
            browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies,
            JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure
            the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control
            over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and
            third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more
            information about their privacy practices.</p>

        <p>GroundLink.com may also display targeted advertising based on personal information about users. Although
            GroundLink.com does not provide any personal information to advertisers, advertisers (including ad-serving
            companies) may assume that users who interact with or click on a targeted advertisement meet the targeting
            criteria used to display the ad (for example, users in the northwestern United States who travel).</p>

        <h3><a name="rq5">Which Information Can I Access?</a></h3>

        <p>GroundLink.com gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with
            GroundLink.com for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.</p>

        <h3><a name="rq6">What Choices Do I Have?</a></h3>

        <p>
        </p><ul class="list">
            <li>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to
                make a purchase or to take advantage of such GroundLink.com features as your Profile, Account Management,
                Customer Reviews.
            </li>
            <li>You can add or update certain information. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the
                prior version for our records.
            </li>
            <li>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer Communication
                Preferences in “My Preferences”. (If you do not want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal
                notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of GroundLink.com,
                and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)
            </li>
            <li>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from
                accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
                disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser
                add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Website of its
                manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of GroundLink.com's essential
                features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <h3><a name="rq7">Are Children Allowed to Use GroundLink.com?</a></h3>

        <p>If you are under 18, you may use GroundLink.com only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.
        </p>

        <h3><a name="rq8">Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</a></h3>

        <p>If you choose to visit GroundLink.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our
            Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of
            the state of Washington. If you have any concern about privacy at GroundLink.com, please contact us with a
            thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.</p>

        <p>Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also. We may
            e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you
            should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy
            Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we
            make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of
            customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.</p>

        <h3><a name="rq9">Examples of Information Collected</a></h3>

        <h4>Information You Give Us</h4>

        <p>You provide most such information when you reserve a ride, request a quote, post, or participate in a contest
            or questionnaire, or communicate with customer service. For example, you provide information when you search
            for a product; place an order through GroundLink.com or one of our third-party sellers; make a purchase;
            provide information in Your Account (and you might have more than one if you have used more than one e-mail
            address when shopping with us) or Your Profile; communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; complete
            a questionnaire or a contest entry form; provide employer information when opening a corporate account. As a
            result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address, and phone numbers;
            credit card information; people for whom rides have been reserved, including addresses and phone number;
            e-mails to us; personal description in Your Profile; and financial information, including Social Security
            and driver's license numbers.</p>

        <h4>Automatic Information</h4>

        <p>Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect
            your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as
            browser type, version, and time-zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and
            platform; purchase history, which we sometimes aggregate with similar information from other customers to
            create features; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site,
            including date and time; cookie number; products you viewed or searched for; and the phone number you used
            to call our 800 number. We may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash
            Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain parts of our Website for fraud prevention and other
            purposes. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session
            information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page
            interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from
            the page.</p>

        <h4>Information from Other Sources</h4>

        <p>Examples of information we receive from other sources include updated address information from our carriers
            or other third parties, which we use to correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication
            more easily; account information, purchase or redemption information, and page-view information from some
            merchants with which we operate co-branded businesses or for which we provide technical, fulfillment,
            advertising, or other services. Search term and search result information from some searches conducted
            through the Web search features offered by our subsidiaries, Alexa Internet and A9.com; search results and
            links, including paid listings (such as Sponsored Links); and credit history information from credit
            bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect fraud and to offer certain credit or financial services to
            some customers.</p>

        <h4>Information You Can Access</h4>

        <p>Examples of information you can access easily at GroundLink.com include up-to-date information regarding recent
            reservations and completed transactions; personally identifiable information (including name, e-mail,
            password, communications preferences, and address book); payment settings (including credit card information
            and gift certificate, gift card, and check balances); e-mail notification settings (including Alerts,
            Available to Order notifications, Delivers, and newsletters); recommendations (including recent product view
            history, and prior order history); and your Profile.</p>
