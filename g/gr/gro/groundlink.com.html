		<a name="rq">What Personal Information About Customers Does
			GroundLink.com Gather?</a>
	</h3>

	<p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and
		continually improve your shopping experience at GroundLink.com. Here are
		the types of information we gather.</p>
	<ul class="list">
		<li><strong>Information You Give Us: </strong>We receive and
			store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any
			other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but
			then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.
			We use the information that you provide for such purposes as
			responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you,
			improving our interface, and communicating with you.</li>
		<li><strong>Automatic Information: </strong>We receive and store
			certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For
			example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain
			types of information when your Web browser accesses GroundLink.com</li>
		<li><strong>E-mail Communications: </strong>To help us make
			e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation
			when you open e-mail from GroundLink.com if your computer supports such
			capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received
			from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary
			messages to our customers.</li>
		<li><strong>Information from Other Sources: </strong>We might
			receive information about you from other sources and add it to our
			account information.</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>

	<h3 class="float-none">
		<a name="rq1">What About Cookies?</a>
	</h3>

	<p></p>
	<ul class="list">
		<li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your
			computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems
			to recognize your browser.</li>
		<li>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell
			you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to
			have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
			disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete
			similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by
			changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Website of its
			manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of
			some of GroundLink.com's essential features, we recommend that you leave
			them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our
			cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart,
			proceed to Checkout, or use any GroundLink.com products and services
			that require you to Sign in.</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>

	<h3 class="float-none">
		<a name="rq2">Does GroundLink.com Share the Information It Receives?</a>
	</h3>

	<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our
		business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We
		share customer information only as described below and with
		subsidiaries GroundLink.com, Inc. controls that either are subject to
		this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as
		those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
	<ul class="list">
		<li><strong>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: </strong>We
			work closely with our affiliated businesses. In some cases, such as
			Marketplace and Auctions sellers, these businesses sell offerings to
			you at GroundLink.com. In other cases, we provide services, or sell
			product lines jointly with these businesses. You can tell when a
			third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customer
			information related to those transactions with that third party.</li>
		<li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers: </strong>We employ
			other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.
			Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive
			information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing
			assistance, providing search results and links (including paid
			listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing
			customer service. They have access to personal information needed to
			perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</li>
		<li><strong>Promotional Offers: </strong>Sometimes we send offers
			to selected groups of GroundLink.com customers on behalf of other
			businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name
			and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust
			your Customer Communication Preferences.</li>
		<li><strong>Business Transfers: </strong>As we continue to
			develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or
			business units. In such transactions, customer information generally
			is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the
			promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course,
			the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that
			GroundLink.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired,
			customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Protection of GroundLink.com and Others: </strong>We
			release account and other personal information when we believe
			release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our
			Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights,
			property, or safety of GroundLink.com, our users, or others. This
			includes exchanging information with other companies and
			organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
			Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing,
			or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from
			customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set
			forth in this Privacy Notice.</li>
		<li><strong>With Your Consent: </strong>Other than as set out
			above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to
			third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to
			share the information.</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>

	<h3 class="float-none">
		<a name="rq3">How Secure Is Information About Me?</a>
	</h3>

	<p></p>
	<ul class="list">
		<li>We work to protect the security of your information during
			transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which
			encrypts information you input.</li>
		<li>We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card
			numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire
			credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during
			order processing.</li>
		<li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized
			access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off
			when finished using a shared computer</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>

	<h3 class="float-none">
		<a name="rq4">What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to
			Other Websites?</a>
	</h3>

	<p>Our site may include third-party advertising and links to other
		websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer
		information to these advertisers or third-party websites.</p>

	<p>These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet
		advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use
		technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our
		website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP
		address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web
		beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other
		technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to
		personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control
		over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information
		practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not
		covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more
		information about their privacy practices.</p>

	<p>GroundLink.com may also display targeted advertising based on
		personal information about users. Although GroundLink.com does not
		provide any personal information to advertisers, advertisers
		(including ad-serving companies) may assume that users who interact
		with or click on a targeted advertisement meet the targeting criteria
		used to display the ad (for example, users in the northwestern United
		States who travel).</p>

	<h3 class="float-none">
		<a name="rq5">Which Information Can I Access?</a>
	</h3>

	<p>GroundLink.com gives you access to a broad range of information
		about your account and your interactions with GroundLink.com for the
		limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that
		information.</p>

	<h3 class="float-none">
		<a name="rq6">What Choices Do I Have?</a>
	</h3>

	<p></p>
	<ul class="list">
		<li>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide
			information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to
			take advantage of such GroundLink.com features as your Profile, Account
			Management, Customer Reviews.</li>
		<li>You can add or update certain information. When you update
			information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our
			records.</li>
		<li>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us,
			please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences in "My
			Preferences". (If you do not want to receive Conditions of Use and
			other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those
			notices will still govern your use of GroundLink.com, and it is your
			responsibility to review them for changes.)</li>
		<li>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell
			you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to
			have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
			disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete
			similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by
			changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Website of its
			manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of
			some of GroundLink.com's essential features, we recommend that you leave
			them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our
			cookies, you will not be able to use any GroundLink.com products and
			services that require you to Sign in.</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>

	<h3 class="float-none">
		<a name="rq7">Are Children Allowed to Use GroundLink.com?</a>
	</h3>

	<p>If you are under 18, you may use GroundLink.com only with the
		involvement of a parent or guardian.</p>

	<h3 class="float-none">
		<a name="rq8">Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</a>
	</h3>

	<p>If you choose to visit GroundLink.com, your visit and any dispute
		over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use,
		including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and
		application of the law of the state of Washington. If you have any
		concern about privacy at GroundLink.com, please contact us with a
		thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.</p>

	<p>Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the
		Conditions of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders
		of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to,
		but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes.
		Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all
		information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind
		the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our
		policies and practices to make them less protective of customer
		information collected in the past without the consent of affected
		customers.</p>

	<h3 class="float-none">
		<a name="rq9">Examples of Information Collected</a>
	</h3>

	<h4 class="float-none">Information You Give Us</h4>

	<p>You provide most such information when you reserve a ride,
		request a quote, post, or participate in a contest or questionnaire,
		or communicate with customer service. For example, you provide
		information when you search for a product; place an order through
		GroundLink.com or one of our third-party sellers; make a purchase;
		provide information in Your Account (and you might have more than one
		if you have used more than one e-mail address when shopping with us)
		or Your Profile; communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise;
		complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form; provide employer
		information when opening a corporate account. As a result of those
		actions, you might supply us with such information as your name,
		address, and phone numbers; credit card information; people for whom
		rides have been reserved, including addresses and phone number;
		e-mails to us; personal description in Your Profile; and financial
		information, including Social Security and driver's license numbers.</p>

	<h4 class="float-none">Automatic Information</h4>

	<p>Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the
		Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the
		Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection
		information such as browser type, version, and time-zone setting,
		browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform;
		purchase history, which we sometimes aggregate with similar
		information from other customers to create features; the full Uniform
		Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site,
		including date and time; cookie number; products you viewed or
		searched for; and the phone number you used to call our 800 number. We
		may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known
		as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain parts of
		our Website for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some
		visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and
		collect session information, including page response times, download
		errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction
		information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods
		used to browse away from the page.</p>

	<h4 class="float-none">Information from Other Sources</h4>

	<p>Examples of information we receive from other sources include
		updated address information from our carriers or other third parties,
		which we use to correct our records and deliver your next purchase or
		communication more easily; account information, purchase or redemption
		information, and page-view information from some merchants with which
		we operate co-branded businesses or for which we provide technical,
		fulfillment, advertising, or other services. Search term and search
		result information from some searches conducted through the Web search
		features offered by our subsidiaries, Alexa Internet and A9.com;
		search results and links, including paid listings (such as Sponsored
		Links); and credit history information from credit bureaus, which we
		use to help prevent and detect fraud and to offer certain credit or
		financial services to some customers.</p>

	<h4 class="float-none">Information You Can Access</h4>

	<p>Examples of information you can access easily at GroundLink.com
		include up-to-date information regarding recent reservations and
		completed transactions; personally identifiable information (including
		name, e-mail, password, communications preferences, and address book);
		payment settings (including credit card information and gift
		certificate, gift card, and check balances); e-mail notification
		settings (including Alerts, Available to Order notifications,
		Delivers, and newsletters); recommendations (including recent product
		view history, and prior order history); and your Profile.</p>
