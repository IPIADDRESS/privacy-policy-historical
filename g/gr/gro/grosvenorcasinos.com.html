<p>3. <strong>Opening an account with us</strong></p>
<p>3.1 When opening an account you are requested to choose your own username and password. You should ensure that these details are kept private, as you are responsible for all activity on your account, where the correct security information has been provided. If you lose, or forget, your username and/or password, or if you believe that a third party is aware of them, you should contact us immediately. If another person accesses your account due to your negligence (for example, not keeping your username and password private or leaving your computer unattended without logging out) you are responsible for all their actions and any losses they may incur on your account.</p>
<p>3.2 When you open an account with us you are confirming that:</p>
<ul style="margin: 0 0 0 4em;">
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">3.2.1 you are at least 18 years of age and above the legal age for gambling in the jurisdiction in which you live (see section 4 – proof of age and identity);</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">3.2.2 are not restricted from opening an account under the ‘Geographical restrictions’ section of these conditions (see section 5);</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">3.2.3 you are accessing the website from the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland or Gibraltar;</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">3.2.4 you are acting for yourself and not on behalf of anyone else and are not limited in your legal capacity to enter into, and adhere to, these conditions;</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">3.2.5 you will only have one account for the website at any one time;</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">3.2.6 you have not excluded yourself from gambling and you have not previously held an account with us or with any other gambling operator (in both cases whether online or “in club”) which was suspended or terminated due to your wrongdoing;</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">3.2.7 the details that you have provided us with are true, correct and complete and you will inform us of any changes to the information you have provided in accordance with section 4 of these conditions;</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">3.2.8 you will not use, or allow any other person to use, the website for fraudulent purposes, or in connection with a criminal offence or other unlawful activity; and</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">3.2.9 you do not work for us or one of our associated companies, or suppliers of our gambling equipment and services, and/ or are not otherwise acting on their behalf.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.3 We may refuse services, terminate your account, forfeit the balance of your account and recover any affected payouts, bonuses or winnings if, at any time, you are in breach of applicable laws, the Terms of Use or any other applicable terms and conditions, guidelines or policies.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. Proof of your age and identity</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4.1 To register with us you must be at least 18 years of age and above the legal age for gambling in the jurisdiction in which you live (the “Appropriate Age”), as underage gambling is an offence. We may request proof of age and residency documentation from you at any time which you agree to provide to us promptly. If you are subsequently found to be under the Appropriate Age at the time you placed transactions with us (or we are unable to verify your age for any reason) your account will be closed, all transactions placed whilst you were under the Appropriate Age will be voided and all related funds deposited will be returned. However we shall not be obliged to pay any winnings which might otherwise have been payable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4.2 We are also required to comply with anti-money laundering legislation and we may request proof of identity information from you from time to time, which you agree to provide to us promptly. In particular, we may undertake a search with Experian for the purpose of verifying your identity. To do so Experian may check the details you supply against any particulars on any database (public or otherwise) to which they have access. They may also use your details in the future to assist other companies for verification purposes. A record of the search will be retained.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4.3 You may sometimes be asked to provide background information about yourself and the source of the funds used to play on our websites. We may be required to obtain this information because:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&nbsp; a)We seek to ensure that our customers enjoy their play and do so within their means.&nbsp; This is a part of our “Keep it Fun” responsible gambling policy. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&nbsp; b)If customers regularly spend higher amounts with us, like all operators we have a legal obligation to show that the money being spent is legitimate.&nbsp; This does not mean that we are suspicious about you personally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4.4 By registering with this site, you agree to provide any appropriate information needed to meet the requirements mentioned above</span></p>
<p>5. <strong>Geographical restrictions</strong></p>
<p>5.1 We only accept wagers or play from persons located in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Gibraltar (the “Permitted Jurisdictions”). This list of Permitted Jurisdictions may be changed by us from time to time.</p>
<p>5.2 It is your responsibility to comply at all times with your own local, national or state laws that relate to gambling.</p>
<p>5.3 Although we take appropriate measures to restrict access to our website to persons located in the Permitted Jurisdictions, no winnings shall be paid to you if you do obtain access outside the Permitted Jurisdictions.</p>
<p>5.4 We reserve the right to terminate your account and refuse any use of our services if we know or reasonably suspect that you have been using them whilst located outside the Permitted Jurisdictions.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Keeping your details up to date</strong></p>
<p>If any of your personal account details or financial information relevant to your account change, you must inform us immediately, as failure to do so may result in transactions being declined by your financial institution. To change any of your account information, you can access and amend your information using the “My Account” section of the website. Should your credit card used on your account be lost, stolen or re-issued, please notify us as soon as possible by contacting customer services.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Your use of our website</strong></p>
<p>7.1 We may refuse to register you and/or to suspend and/or terminate your account at any time and/or to refuse to accept any wager or transaction. We shall not be liable to you in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such action. In addition, we reserve the right to refund to you or withhold any payment of monies from or into your account if there is suspicion or evidence of any of the following: manipulation of our financial system, a breach of any applicable law, regulation or any of the Terms of Use.</p>
<p>7.2 Use of your account otherwise than in accordance with the Terms of Use or any other abuse of your account is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>7.3 We may withdraw any promotional offers (including bonuses, free bets or tokens) at any time.</p>

<p>8.1 You must exercise your own judgment in placing a wager and you acknowledge that you have not relied on any statement or advice from us or our employees in deciding to place a wager.</p>
<p>8.2 We may refuse or limit the whole or part of any wager for any reason at our discretion. You are not allowed to place a wager greater than the amount in credit in your account.</p>
<p>8.3 We may set the maximum and minimum stake amounts and these will be set out in the individual games rules.</p>
<p>8.4 Wagers do not become valid until our systems confirm that the wager has been accepted and until we have received payment.</p>
<p>8.5 For some games, we will pass you to a third party system. These systems may not provide you with all of the reporting information you will find on our main site. Should you require additional wager information, please contact our customer services.</p>
<p>9. <strong>Deposits and withdrawals</strong></p>
<p>9.1 You may deposit monies to an account with us by using the payment methods listed on the website.</p>
<p>9.2 Interest is not payable on account balances.</p>
<p>9.3 You can make withdrawals from your account up to your current available balance subject to the following conditions:-</p>
<ul style="margin: 0 0 0 4em;">

<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">9.3.2 for non-UK issued Mastercards (including some UK Mastercards), we may not able to pay funds back to these credit cards. Withdrawals will, where possible, be processed by bank transfer;</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">9.3.3 for Visa cards and other third party payment processing websites (such as Neteller &amp; Skrill), there may be limits on withdrawals put in place by the relevant payment service provider from time to time.

<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">9.3.4 for bank transfer to UK bank accounts, each withdrawal must be at least £5, or other currency equivalent (save in the case of a final withdrawal to close an account).</li>
</ul>
<p>9.4 We reserve the right to charge a processing fee of not more than £5 for bank transfer withdrawals. A transfer will only be made to an account in your name and such account must be held in a Permitted Jurisdiction. Where you are requesting a bank transfer for the first time, we will require proof of identity to be provided.</p>
<p>9.5 If, as part of a promotional campaign or competition, we credit an amount to your account (which may include cash or goodwill credits), you can only use such amounts as wagers for playing on our websites. You are not entitled to withdraw such amounts unless you have complied with any specific wagering requirements notified to you and we reserve the right to reclaim those amounts on expiry of the period specified in the promotion or, if no period is specified, after 30 days from the date on which your account was credited.</p>
<p>9.6 You may not make deposits and withdrawals to and from your account with us in order to obtain goods or services from a third party, such as loyalty rewards or vouchers.</p>
<p>9.7 You may only make deposits and withdrawals into your account for the purpose of using the website in good faith and for the purpose for which it is provided and we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account in the event that we suspect that you are using your account for any other purpose. We may also be required by law or any relevant authority to report any such activity and act in accordance with that authority's directions in relation to your account and the funds in it.</p>

<p>12.2 We will endeavour to provide the website using our reasonable skill and care.</p>
<p>12.3 If we fail to comply with the Terms of Use or are negligent, we will be responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breach of the Terms of Use or our negligence but we will not be responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if such loss or damage was an obvious consequence of our breach or if they were contemplated by you and us at the time we entered into this contract.</p>
<p>12.4 We only supply the website for domestic and private use. You agree not to use the website for any commercial or business purpose, and we have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.</p>
<p>12.5 We will not be liable for any breach of the Terms of Use if such a breach is caused by a matter beyond our reasonable control (other than matters caused by our breach of contract or negligence). Such matters include access delays or access interruptions, any system or communication errors relating to the generation of random numbers, wager settlement or other elements of the gaming services, data non-delivery or data mis-delivery, acts of God or other circumstances beyond our control, the unauthorised use of your security access details, damage to goodwill or reputation and errors, omissions, or misstatements in any and all information or services(s) provided by us to you.</p>

<p>14.2 You may make such a request by contacting our customer services through any of the methods listed in section 1 above or by utilising our website feature for self-exclusion. Please include your full name, address, username and date of birth in your contact with us and please also tell us the reason why you wish to self-exclude from our website.</p>
<p>14.3 Use of this opt-out facility will result in your account being blocked for a minimum of six months. We will return any withdrawable balance of your account to you and we will not accept wagers from your account during this period. During the period in which you are excluded, you must not attempt to re-open your account or try to open new accounts.</p>
<p>14.4 If you do feel that you have a gambling problem, self-exclusion is advisable but should be used in conjunction with other self-help measures, such as seeking help and guidance from Gamcare (gamcare.org.uk). Please be aware that it is ultimately your own responsibility to uphold a self-exclusion but we will make every effort to stop you playing on the account from which you have excluded. However, should you manage to open a new account by using different personal details of any kind, we will not be responsible for any losses you may subsequently incur as a result of your circumventing the self-exclusion process and may also withhold winnings in certain cases.</p>
