    <div class="modifyDate">Last Modified 5/31/2018</div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Thank you for using Grokker! We wrote this Privacy Policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and how you can access and control your information.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and disclosed when you use Grokkers website (grokker.com), content, apps, products, and services (collectively, the "Services"). The Services are owned and operated by Grokker, Inc. ("Grokker", "we" or "us"). Weve tried to make it easy and straightforward, but if you have any questions please <a href="mailto:support@grokker.com" class="nodecorate">contact us at support@grokker.com</a>.</p>
        <div class="titleTextLarge sectionHeader">Information We Collect</div>
        <br>
        <div class="sectionHeader">Your Grokker Account Information</div>
        <p>To use most features of the Services, you must create an account with Grokker. You can create an account either directly or through a Single Sign On (SSO) service provided by one of our partners or your employer. When you create an account with Grokker, you or the SSO service provide us your name and email address. If you are creating your own account, youll also need to provide a password.</p>
        <div class="sectionHeader">Information We Receive from Your Employer</div>
        <p>If you have Grokker through your employer, they may also provide us with the following additional data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your phone and physical address</li>
            <li>Your demographic and location information</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="sectionHeader">Your Actions on Grokker</div>
        <p>When you use the Grokker Services, we collect information about the actions you take, including loving and collecting videos, entering comments or annotations, following topics or users, or marking "I Did This" when you complete a video. All of the actions you take on Grokker are public, and may be visible to other Grokker users. In addition, you may choose to publish information about your actions on Grokker on third party services such as social media accounts.</p>
        <div class="sectionHeader">Information We Collect Automatically</div>
        <p>Like almost all web and mobile products, we automatically collect a variety of information when you use the Grokker Services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Log Data.</i> Our servers automatically record information about your interaction with our products (log data), including information that your browser or your mobile app sends. This log data may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your location, the address of the web page you were visiting before you came to Grokker, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and actions you take on Grokker.</li>
            <li><i>Cookie Data</i> Like many websites, we use "cookies" (a small text file sent to your browser and stored on your device), or similar technologies. We use cookies so that when you re-access Grokker we can automatically log you in or populate the log-in fields for you. You can disable cookies through your browser, however, disabling cookies may limit your ability to use the Grokker Services. </li>
            <li><i>Web beacon</i> A "web beacon," also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is used to transmit information back to a web server. We also use pixel tags in our emails to customers to track effectiveness, response rates, and similar information about when our emails are read or forwarded.</li>
            <li><i>Device Information</i> We may collect information about the device youre using Grokker on, including what type of device it is, what operating system youre using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data.</li>
            <li><i>Analytics</i> We may also use third party applications and services, such as Google Analytics, to collect and analyze information about visitor traffic on our sites and mobile applications. We use this information to analyze and improve the Grokker Services. This information includes general usage information, and may include information such as the number and frequency of our visitors, which pages or features they have visited, which links they have clicked on, and the length of those visits.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="sectionHeader">Health Information</div>
        <p>We may ask you health-related questions in order to recommend videos, programs, and other content to you, and to help you track your progress.</p>

        <p>Apple may choose to gather this data from other applications, your data input on iOS, and your wearables. For this or related information, please refer to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com">www.apple.com</a>.</p>

        <div class="sectionHeader">Third Party Advertising</div>
        <p>On our Services, we and other third parties, such as ad networks and analytics providers, may collect information about your online activities to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests.

        <div class="sectionHeader">Legal Reasons</div>
        <p>We may share information if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Grokker; or to detect, prevent, defend against or otherwise address abuse, fraud, security or legal issues.</p>
        <div class="titleTextLarge sectionHeader">Access, Deletion, and Controls</div>

        <div class="sectionHeader">13. Membership</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Subscription Fees. If you purchase a subscription, you agree to pay the charges made to your account in connection therewith. You will be charged in accordance with the billing terms you agreed to at the time you signed up. Subscriptions automatically renew at the beginning of each billing period (e.g., month or year) which means that by signing up for a subscription membership you are agreeing to have your credit card automatically billed each period until you cancel your subscription. If you do not pay on time or if Grokker cannot charge your credit card or other payment method for any reason, Grokker reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to the Service and terminate these Terms. You may cancel your subscription, but note that your cancellation will take effect starting at the end of your current billing period. So if you cancel mid-period, your cancellation will take effect as of the following period. There are no refunds on subscriptions for billing periods that have already started. Each membership and the rights and privileges provided to a member is personal and non-transferable.</li>
          <li>Authorization. When you provide a payment method to Grokker, you are granting your express consent and are expressly authorizing us (and our designated payment processor) to automatically charge you each period for the subscription membership. If you provide a payment method and our charge results in an overdraft, chargeback or other fee from your bank, you alone are responsible for that fee. EVEN IF YOU DO NOT USE THE SUBSCRIPTION MEMBERSHIP OR ACCESS THE GROKKER APPLICATION, YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SUBSCRIPTION FEES UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION OR IT IS OTHERWISE TERMINATED. In certain limited circumstances, we will offer subscriptions for a longer term (e.g., 3 months, 6 months or even a year). These longer-term subscriptions are charged in full upon purchase, and automatically renew for the same duration as the initial subscription term you selected (e.g., 3 month subscriptions will automatically renew for three months, 6 month subscriptions will renew for six months, and so on). The amount due for the next renewal term will be due and immediately payable in full and charged as of the first day of such renewal term.</li>
          <li>Changes. Grokker may change, modify, add, remove, suspend, cancel or discontinue any aspect of it subscriptions including the functionality, content, and/or availability of any features of such subscriptions at any time in Grokker’s sole discretion. Grokker may increase its fees for any subscription effective the first day of a billing renewal by giving you notice of the new fees at least thirty (30) days before you are billed. If you do not cancel your subscription, you will be deemed to have accepted the new fees.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Withholding Tax. If you are required under any applicable law, regulation or government order to withhold any taxes on any amounts payable by you to Grokker under these Terms, then the amount payable shall be increased to such amount which, after making all required withholdings or deductions of taxes therefrom, will equal the amount payable hereunder had no such withholding taxes or deductions been required. For avoidance of doubt, such withheld amounts may not be claimed as a reduction or offset against any payments due to Grokker under these Terms. You shall make such withholdings or deductions and shall pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the appropriate government authorities according to applicable laws. You shall obtain and furnish to Grokker, within sixty (60) days of such a payment of taxes, official tax receipts or other evidence of payment of all such taxes.
