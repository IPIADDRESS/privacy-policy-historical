Once you register with Grouply and sign in to use our services, you are not anonymous to us.</p>
<p>In order for Grouply to provide you with its products and services, you will also need to provide Grouply with your username and password to your online group account(s) that you want to access through Grouply. We will only use your username and password to access your online group account to the extent necessary to provide the Grouply services and will otherwise keep your password confidential. If you choose to purchase Premium Services (e.g., a custom website address or additional storage or bandwidth) on Grouply, you must provide your credit card or other payment information and your billing address. We use this billing information to process your transactions.</p>

<p>Grouply helps you manage the activity across your various groups. You may receive up to three different types of email from Grouply. The first type are emails related to the Grouply service itself. These emails (e.g., Grouply Smart Digest, individual group messages, friend requests, notifications, alerts) help you track activity across your groups and friends. You can subscribe to and personalize these emails on your personal Settings page in Grouply.</p>
<p>The second type are newsletters or announcements that include new feature descriptions, best practices, success stories, and other information about Grouply that we think you might find useful.  You have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving these emails.</p>
<p>The third type are individual communications such as administrative messages or support request replies that are considered part of your Grouply account membership. We do not offer you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving these emails.</p>
<p>Grouply does not send emails to promote third-party products or services.</p>
