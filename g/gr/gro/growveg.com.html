        <p>If you choose not to provide information requested, then we may need to stop providing the service that depends on that information.</p>
        <p>At the time of collecting information, by whichever method is used, we'll endeavour to alert you and inform you about our purposes and legal basis for processing that information, as well as whether we intend to share the information with anyone else or send it outside of the European Economic Area.

        <h2 class="section-divider">Using your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>Data protection, privacy and security are important to us, and we shall only use your personal information for specified purposes and shall not keep such personal information longer than is necessary to fulfil these purposes. The following are examples of such purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To help us to identify you when you contact us. This will normally be necessary for the performance of our contract or services to you.</li>
            <li>To help us to identify accounts, services and/or products which you could have accessed from us from time to time.</li>
            <li>To help us to administer and to contact you about improved administration of any accounts, services and products we have provided before, do provide now or will or may provide in the future.</li>
            <li>To allow us to carry out customer surveys and research to help improve the products and services we offer to you. This will sometimes require that you consent, but will sometimes be exempt as market research and you may withdraw consent at any time.</li>
            <li>To allow us to contact you by written electronic means (such as email, text or multimedia messages) about products and services offered by us where these products are similar to those you have already purchased from us, and you have not opted out of us contacting you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will not disclose your personal information to any third party except in accordance with this Notice, and if they will be processing the data on our behalf as a data processor (where we'll be the data controller). In that situation, we'll always have a contract with the data processor as set out in the GDPR. This contract provides significant restrictions as to how the data processor operates so that you can be confident your data is protected to the same degree as provided in this Notice.</p>
        <p>Where you give us personal information on behalf of someone else, you confirm that you have provided them with the information set out in this Notice and that they have not objected to such use of their personal information.</p>
        <p>We may allow other people and organisations to use personal information we hold about you in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired or are in the process of being acquired by a third party, in which case personal information held by us, about our customers, will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
            <li>If we have been legitimately asked to provide information for legal or regulatory purposes or as part of legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-divider">Third Party Services with whom we Share Information</h2>
        <p>We do not pass user-related data to any third party except where necessary for the fulfilment of our business obligations and only where an equally strict privacy policy is in effect.  We never rent or sell personal data to other companies.</p>

        <h2 class="section-divider">Protecting Information</h2>
        <p>We have strict security measures to protect personal information.</p>
        <p>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to encrypt any financially sensitive information you input.</p>
        <p>We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.</p>
        <p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign out (log off) when you finish using a shared computer.</p>


        <h2 class="section-divider">Cookies and Other Internet Tracking Technology </h2>
        <p>When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. This sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your computer, which is sent back to us at a later time. These are called 'cookies'. These cookies are listed in the table below.</p>
        <p>We may also use related technology for persisting information about website users such as JavaScript. Multiple cookies may be found in a single file depending on which browser you use. Where applicable, this section of the Notice also relates to that technology but the term 'cookie' is used throughout.</p>
        <p>Some of these cookies are essential to services you've requested from us, whereas others are used to improve services for you, for example through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Letting you navigate between pages efficiently</li>
            <li>Enabling a service to recognise your computer so you don't have to give the same information during one task</li>
            <li>Recognising that you have already given a garden location, email address/username or password so you don't need to enter it for every web page requested</li>
            <li>Measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and that there is enough capacity to ensure they are fast</li>
        </ul>
