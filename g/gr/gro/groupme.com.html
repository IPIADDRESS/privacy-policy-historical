<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Mindless Dribble Inc. (“Mindless Dribble”) is the provider of a service called GroupMe (the “Service”), accessible at http://groupme.com/. Mindless Dribble Inc. seeks to respect your privacy - the below should serve as an accessible guide to the information we collect during your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree that you are over 13 years of age.</p>

<h3>Collected Information Provided by User</h3>

<p>GroupMe requires several pieces of personal information in order to operate as designed. Requested information for use of the Service may include: telephone number, e-mail address, name. Some of this information is optional, but a name and an active telephone number are required to use any of GroupMe’s services.</p>

<h3>Additional Collected Information</h3>

<p>GroupMe will also collect non-personally identifiable information. This will typically include browser type, language preference, IP address, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. GroupMe collects this data to optimize and iterate to best serve its users. This information will never be released on an individual basis, but may be released in a compiled manner.</p>

<p>GroupMe may also use cookies or web beacons to track a user’s interactions with the Service. This information will be used for internal purposes only to optimize the GroupMe Service. Users can opt-out of cookies by utilizing the settings provided in their browsers.</p>

<p>Additionally, GroupMe collects information from its mobile phone users (who have installed the GroupMe application) in a similar manner to optimize the mobile experience. Beyond mobile phone numbers, we collect mobile screen resolution, device make and manufacturer, as well as the device’s unique identifier (in the iPhone’s case, a UDID).</p>

<h3>Use of Collected Information</h3>

<p>GroupMe believes that the privacy of its users is paramount and strives to use their data only in ways outlined in this privacy policy. Most uses of data are for internal purposes only. GroupMe may occasionally inform users of new releases and features via any communication methods you have provided to the services.</p>

<p><em>Third Parties:</em> GroupMe may engage certain service providers for additional features (i.e. hosting, etc.). GroupMe will thoroughly examine the privacy policies of partners to ensure that its users’ data is safe and taken care of responsibly. Third parties will not be able to use information in ways that are prohibited by the GroupMe Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><em>Advertising:</em> GroupMe may partner with advertising partners to provide users with targeted and useful contextual advertisements. These partners may set cookies which enable them to recognize your computer and compile information about you or others who use your computer. Ad networks often use this information to better target advertisements that they think will be of use to you. Mindless Dribble Inc.’s Privacy Policy solely governs the use of information and cookies set by the Service and not by any third-party advertising partners.</p>

<p><em>Transfers:</em> Mindless Dribble Inc. may disclose certain information in the event that it is merged, acquired, sold, or some of its assets are acquired. If, in Mindless Dribble Inc.’s discretion, your information will be handled in a materially different manner than it was by Mindless Dribble Inc., you may have the opportunity to opt-out of having your information shared with any acquirer.</p>

<p><em>Law Enforcement:</em> Mindless Dribble Inc. will cooperate with law enforcement and disclose any requested information if they believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to: (i) handle fraud, attacks against our systems, or security conflicts, (ii) remain in line with currently applicable state and federal laws or regulations, (iii) continue to abide by our Terms of Service, or (iv) protect the public or Mindless Dribble Inc. from any attacks against intellectual or physical property rights.</p>

<h3>Your Responsibility Online</h3>

<p>GroupMe places a premium on protecting your information, but you should remain aware that any information you share online or via text message can be accessed by others. Mindless Dribble Inc. is not responsible for the actions of those who obtain your content in this manner. Mindless Dribble Inc. cannot guarantee your safety and security and you should be aware that submitting any information and using the GroupMe service is done at your own risk.</p>

<h3>Jurisdiction</h3>

<p>All information passed through GroupMe is handled in the United States. By using the Service, you agree that the handling of your personal information and any communication through the Service will be governed by the laws of the United States and any applicable state laws.</p>

<h3>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>
