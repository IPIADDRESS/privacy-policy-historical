      <br>
      This privacy policy covers how IGC treats personal information that IGC collects and receives. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable including but not limited to your name, address, email address, or phone number.<br>
      <br>
      Children under 13 are not permitted to use any IGC services, and so this privacy policy makes no provision for children's use of the site.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="style3">INFORMATION COLLECTION AND HOW IT IS USED</span><br>
      <span class="style2">General Information</span> <br>

      <br>
      When you register we may ask for your email address and certain optional information such as your name, birth date, birth place, gender, biographical information, ICQ/AIM/Yahoo/MSN user name, and personal interests. We probably won't ask you for all of this though.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      IGC uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, research, and anonymous reporting.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="style2">IP Addresses </span><br>
      IP Addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. Your IP address is stored in our user registration databases when you register with IGC.<br>
      <br>
      IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including:<br>
      <br>
      To diagnose or service technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.<br>
      <br>
      To tailor advertising based on geographic area or other information derived from your IP address. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers.<br>

      <br>IGC allows you to opt into an event-reminder email program.
