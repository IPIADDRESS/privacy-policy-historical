<h2 class="page-title"><strong>I. Information we collect</strong></h2>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Information collected via Technology</strong>

	<p>In an effort to improve the quality of the Site and the Service, we track information provided to us by your browser when you view the Site or use the Service, such as your Internet service provider, the website you came from (known as the “referring URL”), the type of browser you use, your operating system, the device from which you connected to the Service, the time and date of access, the Site pages viewed, time spent at our Site, the sites visited just before and just after our Site, and other information. We track this information using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are a feature of web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc.) software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a site. They are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's web browser on visiting a site to simplify subsequent interactions with that site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transaction on related web pages.
