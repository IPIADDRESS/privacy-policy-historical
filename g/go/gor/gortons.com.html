  <b><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Unilever United States, Inc. Privacy Policy</span></b>
  </p>
  <p>The web site you have entered is operated by or on behalf of a subsidiary
  of Unilever United States, Inc., which is a member of the Unilever group of
  companies ("Unilever").&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Unilever is committed to protecting your personal privacy. This Privacy
  Policy outlines the type of information that is collected by Unilever on this
  web site, and how we use and protect it. This Policy also tells you what to
  do if you do not want your Personal Information collected when you visit our
  web site, and how you can change information you have already provided to
  us.&nbsp; This Policy applies only to the Unilever web sites listed <a href="#sites">here</a>.&nbsp; For example, it does not apply to banners,
  sweepstakes and other advertisements or promotions we may sponsor or participate
  in on web sites owned by third parties. </p>
  <p>For specific information regarding the privacy of children who visit our
  sites, click <a href="#children">here</a>. </p>
  <p><b>Your Consent to This Privacy Policy</b> </p>
  <p>By using our web site, you signify that you agree with the terms of our
  current Privacy Policy as posted in this area of the site. If you do not
  agree with any term in this Policy, please do not provide any Personal
  Information (defined below) on this site. </p>
  <p>If you choose not to provide Personal Information on this site, you may
  not be able to do certain things, like access particular areas of the site,
  enter a sweepstakes or contest, request samples, or send us e-mail. </p>
  <p><b>Collection of Personal Information</b> </p>
  <p>As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means
  personally identifiable information such as your name, street address,
  telephone number, credit card information, screen name and email
  address.&nbsp; The site you entered may collect some or all of these types of
  Personal Information.&nbsp; Please be assured that Unilever will not collect
  any Personal Information from your visits to our sites unless you provide
  this information voluntarily. </p>
  <p>When you provide us with Personal Information, you are authorizing us to
  use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy,
  which includes your right to limit our use of the Personal Information as
  described in this Policy (see "Who to Contact" below). </p>
  <p>The site you entered may also collect Personal Information from you about
  a third party (e.g., the site might allow you to send an electronic
  "post card" to a friend, in which case we will need that person's
  name and e-mail address).&nbsp; Please note that we use such information only
  for the specified purpose (e.g., to mail the post card) and we will not
  contact the third party again by e-mail unless and until the third party
  contacts us. </p>
  <p><b>How We Use Your Information</b> </p>
  <p>When you supply Personal Information at this web site, the brand whose
  site you entered will use it for the express purpose for which it was
  collected (e.g., to enter you in a sweepstakes or to send you a
  sample).&nbsp; It may also be used by the brand whose site you entered, as
  well as by our other brands,&nbsp; to contact you regarding other products
  and services which may be of interest to you (including those we may offer
  jointly with other companies).&nbsp; (For more information on Unilever and
  its brands, see the paragraph about Unilever at the end of this
  Policy.)&nbsp; At any time, however, you may opt out of such future contact.
  (See "Who to Contact" below.) </p>
  <p>At times we may retain third parties to analyze data we collect on our web
  sites, including Personal Information, solely to help us improve our products
  and our web sites.&nbsp; In addition, if you order a product or service from
  us, we may share Personal Information with suppliers and other third parties
  to allow delivery of such product or service.&nbsp; These suppliers and other
  third parties are not authorized by us to use your Personal Information in
  any other way.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Finally, please note that we will release your Personal Information if
  required to do so by law, or by search warrant, subpoena or court
  order.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Other Information We May Collect</b><a name="cookie"></a> </p>
  <p>You may have heard of "cookies," which are files or pieces of
  information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard
  drive.&nbsp; Unilever may use cookies to collect other information during
  your visit to our web site, such as the particular site areas you visit and
  the products or services you buy through our web site. We collect this information
  to better tailor our site and our products to your interests and needs.
  Cookies may also be used to help speed up your future activities at our site;
  the computer can remember that you have already provided Personal Information
  to us and not request that you provide any a second time.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you
  can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being
  sent.&nbsp; Refusal of cookies at the site you entered may result in an
  inability to visit certain areas of the site or to receive personalized
  information when you visit the site. </p>
  <p>In addition, we are constantly trying to improve how we promote our web
  sites. To help us do this, we may measure the effectiveness of our web
  presence by determining what you clicked on to get to our site. </p>
  <p>Information about your computer, such as your IP address (a number
  assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Internet), the type of
  Internet browser you are using and the type of computer operating system you
  are using may also be collected and linked to your Personal
  Information.&nbsp; This is to ensure that our web sites present the best web
  experience for visitors, and that they are an effective information
  resource.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Finally, we may supplement the information that you provided us with other
  information that we receive from third parties.&nbsp; We do this for
  marketing purposes in order to provide more targeted products and service to
  meet your needs. </p>
  <p><b>Children</b><a name="children"></a> </p>
  <p>Unilever is committed to protecting the online privacy of children and
  making the Internet safe for our users. For this reason, Unilever sites which
  are directed in whole or in part at children or likely to attract children
  (for example,&nbsp; "popsicle.com" and "icecreamusa.com")
  have their own specific privacy policy with regard to children.&nbsp; For
  more information about this policy, click <a href="http://www.unileverus.com/privacy/policy_children.html">here.</a> </p>
  <p>At all other Unilever sites, users are told that they must be 13 years or
  older before sending Personal Information. Users under age 13 should not
  submit any Personal Information to us. </p>
  <p>We encourage parents of children under 13 to regularly check and monitor
  their children's use of e-mail and other activities on line </p>
  <p><b>Security of Information</b> </p>
  <p>We take reasonable precautions to keep your Personal Information
  secure.&nbsp; All personally identifiable information is subject to
  restricted access to prevent unauthorized access, modification or
  misuse.&nbsp; </p>
