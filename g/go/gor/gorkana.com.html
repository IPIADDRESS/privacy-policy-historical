Such services may include sending mail, payment processing and marketing services which are necessary to provide you with the services you have requested.</p><p>5.2 We will only disclose information to unrelated third parties without your consent if we are under a duty to disclose or share such information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or on the request of a legal or regulatory authority, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions, or if we are otherwise permitted to do so in accordance with applicable data protection laws. </p><p>5.3 Information relating to journalists in our Media Database may be shared with our corporate subscribers (see section 13).</p><h4>6. STORING AND MAINTAINING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4><p>6.1 We will take appropriate security measures against unlawful or unauthorised processing of your information, and against the accidental loss of, or damage to, your information.

We will take all steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

This information will not usually identify you personally.</p><p>10.3 Some functionality within the Gorkana service enables our corporate subscribers to communicate direct with journalists on the Media Database via the Gorkana service. That functionality also includes tracking technology which will enable the sender to see when a message has been delivered and when it has been opened.  </p><h4 id="cookies">11. COOKIES POLICY</h4><p>11.1 Gorkana’s websites use cookies to understand how you use our website so that we can enhance your experience. As required by the UK interpretation of EU law on Cookies, we have reviewed the cookies used by our services and give advice so that you can manage the use of cookies. </p><p>11.2 Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. They do not contain personally identifiable information such as your name or other personal details – simply a unique identified relevant to you. </p><p>11.3 We use analytical/performance cookies which allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors to our website and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily. We may also use functionality cookies to recognise you when you return to our website. This enables us to personalise our content for you and remember your preferences.  </p><p>11.4 The vast majority of web browsers accept cookies. However, you can change your browser settings so that cookies are not accepted. If you do this, you may lose some of the functionality of the websites. If you need more information about cookies such as what they do, how they work and how to enable/disable them, please go to <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">www.aboutcookies.org</a>.</p><p>11.5 The services we use that use cookies are:</p><p>a) Google Analytics. We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of our websites. Google Analytics generates anonymous statistical and other information about websites by means of cookies, which are stored on users’ computers. The information generated in relation to our websites is used to create reports about the use of the websites. Google will store this information. Google’s privacy policy is available online.</p><p>b) Social Sharing Tools. We use social sharing tools, widgets and plug-ins to allow our users to interact with different social networks. Cookies provided by ShareThis, AddThis, Facebook, Twitter and Google+ may collect information about your browser and usage data. </p><p>c) Vimeo and YouTube.

PHISHING EMAILS</h4><p>"Phishing emails" may circulate the Internet in the name of Gorkana which link to fake websites made to look like our website. These messages are not sent by Gorkana. Gorkana will never send you an email requesting your bank details, login or password, or asking you to make a payment into a bank account. If you have received a message requesting this information or with instructions to pay money into a bank account, please ignore it.</p><p>Key safety tips:</p><p>Be careful accessing Gorkana's site through links contained in e-mails. The address that should appear on your web browser should always start with www.gorkana.com. Fraudsters may provide a link to a bogus site to trick you to disclose your personal information.</p><p>Watch out for SPAM emails with attachments. SPAM emails can be made to look as though they come from a safe source or a friend's email address, however, once you open the attachment they can download a virus on to your computer. Be wary of suspicious looking attachments as even friends can unwittingly send you a virus by email.</p><h4 id="database">13. MEDIA DATABASE</h4><p>13.1 Gorkana takes great pride in the extent and accuracy of its database of media contacts – journalists, bloggers and media outlets – which we call the Media Database. The information we maintain in our Media Database, and how that information is used, depends on the information that has been provided to us, how we obtained that information, and how the media contact uses our services.  This section describes what personal information we obtain about the media contacts on our Media Database and how that information is used. This section should be read in conjunction with the rest of this privacy policy which may also apply media contacts. </p><ul>
<li>What additional information do we collect about journalists on our Media Database? </li>
</ul><p>13.2 In addition to the information referred to at 2.1 above, we may collect additional information about our media contacts which may include information such as your job title, contact information (including mobile phone number and personal email if you provide it to us), career history, beat, articles that you have written, personal interests and other information that may enhance the service that we provide for you and for our corporate subscribers.</p><ul>
<li>How do we obtain information about journalists that is stored in the Media Database? </li>
</ul><p>13.3 In addition to the sources of information set out in section 2.1 above, the information we hold in relation to journalists on our Media Database comes from a variety of sources, including, in particular:</p><p>a) information provided to us direct by journalists (for example, when signing up for one of our services, such as Media Alerts, or when responding to a request for information from Gorkana);</p><p>b) from media outlets (newspapers, magazines etc), who will periodically provide information relating to journalists employed by or connected with them (e.g. current job titles, contact information, areas of interest);</p><p>c) from publicly available sources (such as news stories, press releases, online media);</p><p>d) from other third party sources (for example, information provided by Gorkana’s customers or from other journalists).</p><p>13.4 We will not add any individual journalist to our Media Database without that person’s consent or with the consent of someone acting with that person’s authority.  </p><ul>
<li>How the Media Database is used</li>
</ul><p>13.5 In addition to the general uses in section 4.1, information about our journalists that is contained in the Media Database may be made available to our corporate subscribers who use our products and services.  For example, Gorkana’s corporate PR customers that subscribe to our Media Database &amp; Alerts service will have access to information about journalists that we hold in the Media Database, and will be sent alerts providing information about changes to the database (for example, changes in job titles, journalist moves, and contact information). </p><ul>
<li>Maintaining the Media Database</li>
</ul><p>13.6 Gorkana prides itself in maintaining up to date and accurate data on the Media Database. We will update our records as soon as possible after receiving information that requires changes to our database. Such information may come to us from any of the sources referred to above. We may also receive information from other sources, for example, out of office messages. Whenever a substantive change is made to a journalist entry we will notify the journalist of the change, and, where appropriate, not make any change until it has been approved by the journalist.</p><p>13.7 As a journalist you will always have the opportunity to review and request changes to the information we hold about you. </p><p>13.8 If you no longer wish to be on the Media Database we will remove you from it. You may still receive other services (e.g. Media Alerts) even if you are no longer on the Media Database.</p><p>13.9 If, at any time, you wish to be removed from the Media Database, or if you would like to review your profile, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@gorkana.com">privacy@gorkana.com</a>.</p><h4>14. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY/ CONTACT POINTS</h4><p>14.1 Any changes that we make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by email.</p><p>14.2 If you have any questions or concerns about how Gorkana handles your personal information, please contact our Data Protection Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@gorkana.com">privacy@gorkana.com</a>.</p></div><div class="base_column clear"></div></div></div><div id="upper_nav_wrapper" class="min_width"><div class="wrapper"><div id="select_wrapper"><form><select id="country_select"><option value="xx">Choose Region</option><option value="eu">Europe</option><option value="us">USA</option><option value="fr">France</option><option value="de">Deutschland</option></select><input class="go_button" type="submit" value="Go"></form></div><ul class="horizontal_nav web_content"><li class="first"><a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Navigation / Header / About us', 'click', 'About us']);" href="/about-us">About us
