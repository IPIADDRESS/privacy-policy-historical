<h2>Privacy Policy</h2><br>


 <div class="about_banner" style="-moz-border-radius: 10px 10px 10px 10px; height: 180px ! important;font-size: 15px;">
    <p>The purpose behind founding GoBigg is to help people in managing their bookmarks and share what they like among the people and during the process, gain a status in the domain based on the social popularity of the content shared. We understand the importance of individuals privacy and we take that up with utmost importance. Please read the policy in detail for further details on how we value your privacy concerns.</p>
    <p>This policy covers GoBigg's take on personal information that is being shared with us while registering and using our services. We do not control on how third parties approach with the information shared by GoBigg and do not hold any responsibility on such parties which GoBigg does not manage or have no control on.</p>
    <br>
</div>
<br><br>
<strong style="font-size: 16px;">Collection of Information</strong>
<p style="font-size: 14px;">We collect personal information that is important for the purpose of giving our services on the website i.e. to enable individuals to collect and manage your bookmarks, share what you like and build an online reputation based on the reputation of the content shared. We do not possess this information in a way that is incompatible with our business purpose. The information collected from our users is as below:</p>

<strong style="font-size: 16px;">1. Information You Provide to Us: </strong>
<p style="font-size: 14px;">We store information that we receive from you while registering for our services or provide in any other way for example by connecting via other social networking services e.g. Facebook, Twitter etc. You can choose not to provide additional information other than what is mandatory but that would result in our inability to serve you to the full.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px;">In order to register, you can complete the registration form available on our website or connect via third party services like Facebook or twitter. Based on the permissions granted by you on these services, we can automatically pull your information that is relevant to us. The basic information include: First Name, Last Name, your photo, email address and date of birth. </p>
<p style="font-size: 14px;">User Profile: To allow you to express yourself beyond just the information collected during registration; we enable you to provide additional information, such as a bio, favorite URLs, social networking URL's for LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook. In addition, you may choose to include photos of yourself in your profile. </p>
<br>
<strong style="font-size: 16px;">E-mail Communications</strong>
<p style="font-size: 14px;">GoBigg is very concerned about your privacy and we will never provide your email address to a third party. GoBigg may send out e-mails with GoBigg-related news, products, offers, surveys or promotions. You may also receive notification e-mails from GoBigg, which inform you of actions that have been performed on the site. </p>

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>

The User Profile is the area on GoBigg where we allow you to tell other GoBigg users about yourself and your interests.</li>
<li>Member Directory: The e-mail address that you submit upon registration will be searchable by other GoBigg users who know you by your email address, unless you choose to opt out of this feature. This is primarily so that other users can find you to establish friendship through GoBigg. You may opt-out of this feature by visiting the Privacy Settings section of your User Profile.</li>
