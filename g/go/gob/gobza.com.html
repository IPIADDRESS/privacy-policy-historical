    </div>
    <div class="terms-section">
        <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>
            This privacy policy is designed to inform users of the Gobza website (www.gobza.com), mobile applications, microsites, software and service (collectively, the “Service”) about how Tops Global, Inc., doing business as Gobza (“Gobza”, “we” or “us”), gathers and uses personal information collected by us in connection with use of the Service.  Gobza will take reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this policy and with applicable U.S. laws.  In this policy, “user” or “you” means any person using the Service, whether by browsing the Gobza website or mobile apps, purchasing a Gobza promotional voucher (“Vouchers”) that may be exchanged for goods and services offered by Gobza merchants (each a “Merchant”), uploading or exchanging a Voucher, or participating in any other activities available through the Service.  BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR WEBSITE TERMS OF SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE.</p>
        <p><strong>First Up, We Want You to Know This</strong><br><br>
            We will never disclose your email address to any user (including Merchants) or any other third party for their marketing purposes.  This allows you to use Gobza without receiving a whole lot of direct marketing you don't want.</p>
        <p><strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong><br><br>
            <u>Information You Share</u>: Gobza collects some of your personal information in connection with the Service.  When you sign up to create a Gobza account, purchase a Voucher, submit content to Gobza, complete a survey, send us feedback, request information about the Service, apply for a job, post a video, or sign up for special offers from third parties, Gobza may collect personal information from you, such as your email address, first and last name, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information (collectively, “Personal Information”) when you, for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>sign up to create a Gobza account,</li>
            <li>submit or post content to Gobza,</li>
            <li>participate in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games or applications,</li>
            <li>create, or engage in discussions in, forums or message boards,</li>
            <li>send us feedback or request information about the Service, or</li>
            <li>sign up for special offers from third parties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><br>You do not have to provide Personal Information to Gobza, but you may not be able to take advantage of all features of the Service if you do not.</p>
        <p><u>Information Others Share</u>.  [We may also receive information about you from other people who use the Service and submit or post content about you in a forum or message board].</p>
        <p><u>Web Tracking Information</u>: Gobza and its third party service providers may use web tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and clear GIFs, to collect data related to usage of the Service, the Vouchers and web and email marketing conducted by or on behalf of Gobza.  Such data may include the address of the websites you visited before and after you visited the Service, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, what pages in the Service you visit and what links you clicked on.  In order to collect Web Tracking Information and to make your use of the Service more efficient, we may store cookies on your computer.  Gobza and third party contractors engaged to provide services on behalf of Gobza (“Contractors”) may also use web tracking technologies that are placed in web pages on the Service or in email communications to collect information about actions that users take when they interact with the Service or such email communications.  Web Tracking Information is not correlated by Gobza to individual users.  Some Web Tracking Information may include data, such as IP address data, that is unique to you.  You may be able to modify your browser settings to alter which web tracking technologies are permitted when you use the Service, but this may affect the performance of the Service.</p>

        <p><u>Web Tracking Information</u>:  Gobza uses Web Tracking Information to administer the Service and to understand how well our Service is working, and to develop aggregate, statistical information on usage of the Services.

        <p><u>Email Communications</u>:  If you create an account and provide your email address, we will send you administrative and promotional emails.  If you wish to opt out of promotional emails, you may do so by following the “unsubscribe” instructions in the email, or by editing your account settings as described below.  All users receive administrative emails.  If you wish to opt out of administrative emails, you must delete your account entirely and cease use of the Service.</p>
        <p><strong>What Information Do We Disclose to Third Parties?</strong></p>
        <p><u>Public Disclosure</u>: Gobza is a publicly available marketing platform where Merchants and other users may upload content in their use of the Service. Any information or content you post using your account will be viewable by other users, and in some cases, may be viewable by the general public.</p>
        <p><u>Personal Information</u>:  Gobza does not sell or rent its mailing list, and we will not disclose your email address to any third party for marketing purposes.  Gobza will disclose your Personal Information to third parties only in the following limited circumstances:</p>

Such carriers and service providers are not Gobza's contractors, and any information that a carrier collects in connection with your use of the Service is not “Personal Information” and is not subject to this Privacy Policy.  Gobza is not responsible for the acts or omissions of telecommunications carriers or service providers.</p>
        <p><u>Additional Disclosures</u>:  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, Gobza reserves the right to use or disclose Personal Information and any other information Gobza collects in connection with the Service (a) to any successor to Gobza's business, including as a result of any merger, acquisition, asset sale or similar transaction, (b) to any law enforcement, judicial authority, or governmental or regulatory authority, to the extent required by law or legal process, or (c) if in Gobza's reasonable discretion, such use or disclosure is necessary to enforce or protect Gobza's legal rights or to protect third parties.</p>
