        </p><h5>(c) Cookies.</h5>
        In addition, we use “cookies” on certain pages of our site.
        Cookies are small files that can be used to track a user’s steps or
        automatically generate a user’s password.
        Cookies allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session.
        Cookies can also help us provide information which is targeted to your

        automatically deleted at the end of a session.
        You may decline our cookies if your browser permits, although your use
        of the site will then be restricted.

      <h4>3. How and When the Information is Used.</h4>
      <p>
        Information you submit to Us will fall into two categories.
        The first is personal information, which we will protect and not disclose
        to other Users.
        The second is information you submit for inclusion in your profile.
        Please note that your profile may be viewed by other Users, and as such,
        you should use discretion and consideration before submitting such
        profile information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your information is also used for administering our business activities.
        We may use the information to notify you, either directly or through our
        agent(s) about changes to our website, new services, or special offers.
        You authorize Us to send you newsletters relating to Our Service.

      <h4>4. Legal Requests</h4>
      <p>
        We cooperate with law enforcement authorities, as well as with other
        third parties, to enforce laws, intellectual property rights, and to
        prevent fraud. In response to a verified request by law enforcement
        or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or
        alleged illegal activity, we can, and you authorize us to, disclose your
         email address, login history, fraud complaints, and site use history,
        with or without a subpoena. Without limiting the above, we will not
        disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government
        officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal
        procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of
        information is necessary to protect our rights or to prevent
        imminent physical harm, financial loss or to report suspected past,
        present, or future illegal activity.
        Further, we can, and you authorize us to, disclose to a third party your
        information, including your email address,
        as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in
        connection with an investigation of fraud,
        intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity.

      <h4>5. How We Protect Your Information.</h4>
      <p>
        The privacy and protection of your information is important to us.
        We therefore use practices that are consistent with standards in the
        industry to protect your privacy. Subject to the other sections of this
        Privacy Policy, we do not make any personal information available
        to third parties without your permission. Please note, however, that no
        transmission over the Internet can be fully guaranteed in its
        confidentiality and non-disclosure, and as such you transmit at your
        own risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your access to some services and content, such as the viewing of full
        cook profiles, are password protected.
        We advise that you do not disclose your password to anyone. In addition,
        we recommend you sign out of password-protected services at the end of
        your session. You are responsible for all actions taken with your login
        name and password. Your user password should be held in strict confidence.
        If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control
        over your information and cook profile. Therefore, if your password has
        been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your
        password. We offer you the ability to review and change the information
        you submit to us by logging into the site and entering in the new
        information yourself. Once logged in as a registered user,
        you can change your Password and user preferences.
        Please contact us at support@bookofcooks.com if you are unable to change
        your password. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from
        your failure to comply with this provision.
