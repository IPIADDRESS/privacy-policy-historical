                keep information about you private and secure.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>2. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong><br>
                <br>
                GoShopping.com might collect personally identifying information 
                when you register for a GoShopping.com account, when you use certain 
                GoShopping.com services, including the pages you view, the links 
                you click, and other actions taken in connection with the website. 
                We also collect certain information that your web browser sends

                GoShopping.com uses "cookies" to recognize returning

                From time to time, we might use your information for unanticipated 
                uses, such as notification of new services, announcements, and 
                general communications.<br>
                If our information practices materially change, we will post such 
                changes to the website before we use your data for these new purposes.<br>
                If you are concerned about how we use your information, please 
                periodically check this privacy policy.<br>
                We do not knowingly collect personal information from children, 
                and we will destroy such information if it anyone discloses it

                <strong>3. USE OF INFORMATION</strong><br>
                <br>
                GoShopping.com uses the personal information you provide to deliver 
                services, respond to your inquiries, or to process your requests. 
                We might share the personal information you provide with other 
                companies we have hired to provide services for us. These companies 
                are contractually bound to use personal information we share with 
                them only to perform the services that we have hired them to provide. 
                We do not share, sell, or lease personal information about you 
                to any third parties for their marketing use.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>4. PROTECTION OF INFORMATION</strong><br>
                <br>
                We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your 
                information from your Internet connection to our servers. We have 
                implemented technology and security policies, rules, and other 
                measures to protect the personal data that we have under our control 
                from unauthorized access, improper use, alteration, unlawful or 
                accidental destruction, and accidental loss. We also protect your 
                information by requiring that all our employees and others who 
                have access to or are associated with the processing of your data 
                respect your confidentiality. Only authorized personnel handle 
                your data, and our database servers have a backup system to prevent 
                loss of data. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet 
                can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure, and we will not be 
                held liable should a third party illegally obtain your personal 
                information. While we have made a great effort to protect your 
                personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security 
                of any information you transmit to us. You do so at your own risk.<br>
                <br>
