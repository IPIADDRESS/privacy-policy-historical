<p>We collect Personal Data in a variety of ways:</p>
<li>• <b>Directly from you:</b>  Information is collected directly from you, either by you providing the information directly to us or you acting in a manner that provides us with the information, for example:</li>
<li>• <b>Offline:</b>  We collect Personal Data from you offline, for example when you contact customer service, enroll in a product or service or provide information to us in writing.</li>
<li>• <b>Online:</b>  We collect your Personal Data through the EF Products, for example when you sign up for a newsletter or a brochure or enroll in or use a product or service. We also collect Personal Data:</li>
<li>• <b>Through cookies.</b> “Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use both session and persistent cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard, used to provide useful features for customers. Cookies by themselves, do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. We may append contact information gathered from third parties to cookie data that we collect. Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer or device for recordkeeping and other purposes. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. If you do so, however, you may not be able to take full advantage of our website. For example, the complete online reservation process can only be accessed if you accept cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ .</li> 
<li>• <b>Through your use of a mobile application.</b> When you download and use one of our mobile applications, and to the extent allowed by your privacy settings in the application, we track and collect mobile application usage data, such as the date and time the mobile application on your device accessed our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the mobile application based on your device number.</li>
<li>• <b>Through your device.</b>  Provided that you have enabled that function on your device, we collect the physical location of it to provide you with personalized location-based services and content. Read more about such services under “How do we use Personal Data?”</li>
<li>• <b>Through links.</b>  We track and collect information about how users interact with links across products and services, including through email and links made available through third party services.</li>
<li>• <b>Through browsing our sites.</b> We may also collect information about your use of our services through your browser to trace activity on our sites, such as your IP address, Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, service provider, time of visit, page(s) visited and the name and version of the EF Product you are using.”</li>
<li>• <b>From our corporate affiliates, business partners, assistance providers or claim handlers.</b> We may receive Personal Data from other parties in conjunction with your program, including:</li>
<li>• Our corporate affiliates, such as the local EF company that promotes the sales of our services and offers customer service in your country of residence and provides us with the Personal Data that is needed to come to an agreement with you on your order, or the school in your country of destination that provides some of the services that you have ordered, or the Swiss principal company that is located in Switzerland and is responsible for the performance of the contract with you for any of EF’s offers.</li> 
<li>• Business partners, such as local sales agents that promote the sales of our services in your country of residence. </li>
<li>Claims handlers who receive information about your insurance claims in case of an insurance situation. </li>
<li>• <b>From other sources.</b>  We may receive your Personal Data from other sources, such as public databases; licensed databases from third parties; joint marketing partners such as marketing agencies or providers of software and services for digital marketing automation and analytics; social media platforms, including but not limited to; Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Musically, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube and messenger services such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger; from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected with on social media platforms, as well as from other third parties. For example, if you elect to connect your social media account to your EF Products account, such personal data that you have registered in your profile, such as your email address, phone number, postal address, date of birth, name and user name will be shared with us. Furthermore, we use cookies to track members of social media networks as further explained above in the section “How do we collect Personal Data?”</li>
<p></p><h3><strong>How do we use Personal Data?</strong></h3><p></p>
<p>
</p><li>Your Personal Data will be processed by EF for the purposes of completing your booking, providing you with the products and services that you have ordered (including travel insurance coverage), for customer service, administrative services or as otherwise necessary to perform the contract between you and us or as further described in this policy.</li> 
<li>We may also use Personal Data:</li>
<li>• For statistical purposes, calculating usage levels, and helping diagnose server problems with the EF Products as well as to ensure that the EF Products function properly.</li>

<li>• To allow you to participate on message boards, chat, profile pages and blogs and use other services enabling you to post information and materials.</li>
<li>• To analyse and improve our offers by identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and tailoring the EF Products experience and content based on your past activities on the EF Products. For example, depending on what EF Product you have searched for on our website, or in previous browsing, the offer presented to you on the EF Products may be limited to a specific tour, geography or budget.</li>
<li>• To provide you with personalized location-based services and content through the use of your device’s physical location.

<li>• To market our products and services, including special promotions based on your interests, for example through email marketing solutions such as Salesforce Marketing Cloud’s management software which maintains mailing lists and schedules and modifies email messages based on what recipients read, click-on or forward. All such email communication will include a clear unsubscribe link.</li>
<p></p><h3><strong>How do we share Personal Data?</strong></h3><p></p>
<p>
</p><li>• We share your Personal Data with our corporate affiliates, business partners and service providers both within and outside the U.S. and Canada:</li>

<li>• Business partners are for example local sales agents that promote the sales of our services in your country of residence; transportation or accommodation providers in your destination country; or course leaders, activity leaders or other contractors for management of any of our programs; or a travel insurance company that prepares the travel insurance for you.</li>
