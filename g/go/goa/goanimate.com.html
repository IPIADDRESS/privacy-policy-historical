<h3>GoAnimate, Inc. Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Thank you for visiting this GoAnimate, 
Inc. ("GoAnimate") Internet web site ("Site") located 
at the URL GoAnimate.com. This Privacy Policy details certain policies 
implemented throughout GoAnimate governing GoAnimate's use of personally 
identifiable information about users of our Site and users of our services 
(the "Services").   <br></p><br>
<p>Your privacy is important to us 
and, as described in this Privacy Policy, we try to protect information 
about you from unauthorized disclosure to others. This Privacy Policy 
explains how we collect, use and, in certain circumstances, share your 
personally identifying information. Please read this Privacy Policy 
carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us. 
 </p><br>
<p><b>Privacy Policy Updates</b> </p><br>
<p>Due to the Internet's rapidly 
evolving nature, GoAnimate may need to update this Privacy Policy from 
time to time.  If so, GoAnimate will post its updated Privacy Policy 
on our Site and we may send registered users an email, so you are always 
aware of what personally identifiable information we may collect and 
how we may use this information.  If any modification is unacceptable 
to you, you shall cease using this Site and the Services. If you do 
not cease using this Site and the Services, you will be deemed to have 
accepted the change.</p><br>
<p><b>Information Collection and 
Use</b> </p><br>
<p>You can generally visit our Site 
without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. 
However, in certain sections of this Site and when you use our Services, 
we may invite you to register and become a member of GoAnimate.  
When you register, provide us with feedback or contact us, we may collect 
personally identifiable information, such as your name, contact data 
such as your email address, gender and username and password and any 
other personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide 
to us in your communications that you transmit to us.  We may offer 
you the opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such 
as occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.), or we may be able 
to collect that information from third party sites on which you have 
installed our Services (in accordance with the terms of use of those 
sites).  </p><br>
<p>We also may collect clear gifs 
and web bugs through your use of the Site.  We also may collect 
all of the foregoing personally identifiable information about you from 
third party websites on which you post your animations through application 
programming interfaces and when you request an animation posted or created 
on our Site on a third party site as the animations are hosted on our 
Site.</p><br>
<p>In order to provide the best possible 
service and to allow us to make certain internal reports, we collect 
aggregate information about the use of the Services, including information 
about users accessing the site or viewing animations or using our Services 
on other sites, such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser 
language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of 
clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those 
pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and 
time.</p><br>
<p>We may use your personal information 
to register to use our Site and Services, deliver you certain Services, 
provide you with notices regarding services you have purchased or might 
want to purchase, improve the content and general administration of 
our Site and send you targeted advertising.</p><br>
<p>We make your profile and animations 
available to other users according to the control settings you set for 
yourself. If you have elected to make your animations public, then other 
users will be able to see that you posted animations and view your animations.  
We also use your name, email address and other information on our system 
to notify you of new product releases, service notifications, to solicit 
your feedback and input and to determine the type of content that you 
might like to view. In the event that we decide to allow you to submit 
other information about yourself, the availability of that information 
to other users will also be controlled by privacy settings you will 
set for yourself. In the event that you make your animations publicly 
available, or "embed" them on another publicly available web site 
(such as a social networking site), we may include links to those shows 
or web sites or otherwise identify them in our marketing materials as 
places where GoAnimate animations that may interest other users can 
be found.</p><br>
<p><b>Contests, Sweepstakes, and 
Promotions</b></p><br>
<p>From time to time you may be able 
to participate in contests, giveaways, sweepstakes or other similar 
promotions we sponsor on this Site. Participation such in contests, 
giveaways, sweepstakes or other similar promotions may require sharing 
your personal information with us or third parties sponsoring the contest, 
giveaway, or promotion, and we will use such personal information in 
accordance with the rules for such contest, giveaway, sweepstakes or 
other promotion.  Therefore, you should check the rules to determine 
how your information will be used and shared with others. If a third 
party administers the contest, your participation may be subject to 
additional terms and conditions and that third party's privacy policy. 
We are not responsible for such third parties. You should carefully 
review these third parties' terms and conditions.</p><br>
<p><b>Children's Privacy</b> </p><br>
<p>GoAnimate recognizes the privacy 
interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take 
an active role in their children's online activities and interests.  
This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13.  GoAnimate 
does not target its Services or this Site to children under 13.  
GoAnimate does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information 
from children under the age of 13.  </p><br>
<p><b>Cookies</b> </p><br>
<p>We may use small text files called 
cookies to improve overall Site experience. A cookie is a piece of data 
stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. 
Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you.  </p><br>
<p><b>Others' Information</b></p><br>
<p>You may decide to provide us with 
another person's email address so that person may be invited to join 
GoAnimate. We use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind 
that person that he or she has been invited to join GoAnimate. All invitees 
are provided with the option not to receive further invitations from 
GoAnimate. We may disclose such information if required to do so in 
order to comply with legal process, as described below.</p><br>
<p><b>Disclosure</b> </p><br>
<p>We do not sell or rent your personally 
identifiable information to any third party. We may however provide 
your personally identifiable information and the data generated by cookies 
and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that 
we may engage to assist us.  For example, we may provide your personally 
identifiable information to a marketing, research and/or advertising 
agency to notify you of new product releases, service notifications, 
and to solicit your feedback and input on our behalf.  We will 
disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe 
we are required to do so by law or regulation or in cooperation with 
any governmental investigation.  We may transfer your personally 
identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation 
or other corporate reorganization in which GoAnimate participates or 
to a purchaser of all or substantially all of GoAnimate's assets to 
which this Site relates.  </p><br>
<p><b>Links to Third Party Sites</b> </p><br>
<p>The Site may provide links to 
other Web sites or resources over which GoAnimate does not have control 
("External Web Sites").  Such links do not constitute 
an endorsement by GoAnimate of those External Web Sites.  You acknowledge 
that GoAnimate is providing these links to you only as a convenience, 
and further agree that GoAnimate is not responsible for the content 
of such External Web Sites.  Your use of External Web Sites is 
subject to the terms of use and privacy policies located on the linked 
to External Web Sites.</p><br>
<p><b>Security</b> </p><br>
<p>We may employ procedural and technological 
security measures that are reasonably designed to help protect your 
personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, 
disclosure, alteration or destruction.  GoAnimate may use secure 
socket layer, firewalls, password protection, and other security measures 
to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable 
information.  </p><br>
<p><b>Users Outside of the United 
States</b></p><br>
<p>Our computer systems are currently 
based in the United States, so your personal data will be processed 
by us in the United States where data protection and privacy regulations 
may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the 
world, such as the European Union.  If you create a user account 
with the Site as a visitor from outside the United States, by using 
the Site you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer 
of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an 
equivalent level of protection of that required in the European Union 
or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information 
as described in this Privacy Policy. </p><br>
<p><b>Correction/Updating Personally 
Identifiable Information </b></p><br>
<p>GoAnimate provides you with the 
ability to review, correct and delete your contact information.  
If you wish to review or correct any information you have provided to 
us, you may access your account online.</p><br>
<p>If you have any questions regarding 
this Privacy Policy please contact us via email at privacy-support@GoAnimate.com.  </p><br>
<p>This Privacy Policy was last updated: 
April 1, 2008</p><br>
<p>This Privacy Policy is effective 
as of: April 1, 2008</p><br>
