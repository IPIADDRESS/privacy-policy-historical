<h1>HOW OUR WEBSITE WORKS</h1>
<p>
GoAbroad is a hyper-specialized search engine that connects future travelers to thousands of travel programs and opportunities offered by external organizations and companies worldwide. We do not provide international programs.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to our <strong>comprehensive program directories</strong> and filters, our website helps make the decision-making process easier for travelers. Our travel program directories include:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goabroad.com/adventure-travel-abroad">
Adventure Travel</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goabroad.com/degree-abroad">
Degrees Abroad</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goabroad.com/highschool-study-abroad">
High School Programs Abroad</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goabroad.com/intern-abroad">
Internships Abroad</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jobs.goabroad.com/">
Jobs Abroad</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goabroad.com/language-study-abroad">
Language Schools Abroad</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goabroad.com/study-abroad">
Study Abroad</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goabroad.com/teach-abroad">

<li><a href="https://www.goabroad.com/tefl-courses">
TEFL Certificates</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goabroad.com/volunteer-abroad">
Volunteer Abroad</a></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
Each program directory also features verification levels, real participant reviews of programs, and past participant interviews to help travelers understand what the program experience is like on a deeper level.
</p>
We also provide <strong>resource directories and information</strong> on <a href="https://www.goabroad.com/scholarships-abroad">scholarships abroad</a>, <a href="https://embassy.goabroad.com/">embassies</a>, <a href="https://www.goabroad.com/study-abroad-loans">study abroad loans</a>, and <a href="https://insurance.goabroad.com/">travel insurance</a>, as well as an <a href="https://www.goabroad.com/articles">extensive article directory</a>.
<p></p>
<p>
In addition to our program and resource directories, we also offer <strong>free tools</strong> to help travelers choose an international program: MyGoAbroad and the GoAbroad Online Advisors. MyGoAbroad is a personalized dashboard whereby you can bookmark and compare programs side-by-side, save articles and resources, and organize your travel plans. Our Online Advisor Tool provides a platform for travelers to request customized advice on which programs from our database fit their expressed travel goals and interests.
</p>
<p>
We are the <strong>go-to website for travelers</strong> to find all of the information they need to choose a program abroad. We take this responsibility very seriously, and therefore, continue to evolve our website offerings to meet the needs of the modern explorer.
