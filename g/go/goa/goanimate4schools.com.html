<h1>GoAnimate, Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Thank you for visiting this GoAnimate,
Inc. ("GoAnimate") Internet web site ("Site") located
at the URL goAnimate4schools.com. This Privacy Policy details certain policies
implemented throughout GoAnimate governing GoAnimate's use of personally
identifiable information about users of our Site and users of our services
(the "Services").   <br></p>
<p>Your privacy is important to us
and, as described in this Privacy Policy, we try to protect information
about you from unauthorized disclosure to others. This Privacy Policy
explains how we collect, use and, in certain circumstances, share your
personally identifying information. Please read this Privacy Policy
carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us.
 </p>

<h4>Privacy Policy Updates</h4>
<p>Due to the Internet's rapidly
evolving nature, GoAnimate may need to update this Privacy Policy from
time to time.  If so, GoAnimate will post its updated Privacy Policy
on our Site and we may send registered users an email, so you are always
aware of what personally identifiable information we may collect and
how we may use this information.  If any modification is unacceptable
to you, you shall cease using this Site and the Services. If you do
not cease using this Site and the Services, you will be deemed to have
accepted the change.</p>

<h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
<p>You can generally visit our Site
without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself.
However, in certain sections of this Site and when you use our Services,
we may invite you to register and become a member of GoAnimate.
When you register, provide us with feedback or contact us, we may collect
personally identifiable information, such as your name, contact data
such as your email address, gender and username and password and any
other personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide
to us in your communications that you transmit to us.  We may offer
you the opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such
as occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.), or we may be able
to collect that information from third party sites on which you have
installed our Services (in accordance with the terms of use of those
sites).  </p>
<p>We also may collect clear gifs
and web bugs through your use of the Site.  We also may collect
all of the foregoing personally identifiable information about you from
third party websites on which you post your animations through application
programming interfaces and when you request an animation posted or created
on our Site on a third party site as the animations are hosted on our
Site.</p>
<p>In order to provide the best possible
service and to allow us to make certain internal reports, we collect
aggregate information about the use of the Services, including information
about users accessing the site or viewing animations or using our Services
on other sites, such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser
language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of
clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those
pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and
time. We may also use purpose-built tools provided by third parties to access, monitor, analyze, use and disclose this data.</p>
<p>We may use your personal information
to register to use our Site and Services, deliver you certain Services,
provide you with notices regarding services you have purchased or might
want to purchase, improve the content and general administration of
our Site and send you targeted advertising.</p>
<p>We make your profile and animations
available to other users according to the control settings you set for
yourself. If you have elected to make your animations public, then other
users will be able to see that you posted animations and view your animations.
We also use your name, email address and other information on our system
to notify you of new product releases, service notifications, to solicit
your feedback and input and to determine the type of content that you
might like to view. In the event that we decide to allow you to submit
other information about yourself, the availability of that information
to other users will also be controlled by privacy settings you will
set for yourself. In the event that you make your animations publicly
available, or "embed" them on another publicly available web site
(such as a social networking site), we may include links to those shows
or web sites or otherwise identify them in our marketing materials as
places where GoAnimate animations that may interest other users can
be found.</p>

<h4>Contests, Sweepstakes, and Promotions</h4>
<p>From time to time you may be able
to participate in contests, giveaways, sweepstakes or other similar
promotions we sponsor on this Site. Participation such in contests,
giveaways, sweepstakes or other similar promotions may require sharing
your personal information with us or third parties sponsoring the contest,
giveaway, or promotion, and we will use such personal information in
accordance with the rules for such contest, giveaway, sweepstakes or
other promotion.  Therefore, you should check the rules to determine
how your information will be used and shared with others. If a third
party administers the contest, your participation may be subject to
additional terms and conditions and that third party's privacy policy.
We are not responsible for such third parties. You should carefully
review these third parties' terms and conditions.</p>

<h4>Children's Privacy</h4>
<p>GoAnimate recognizes the privacy
interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take
an active role in their children's online activities and interests.
This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13.  GoAnimate
does not target its Services or this Site to children under 13.
GoAnimate does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information
from children under the age of 13.  </p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>We may use small text files called
cookies to improve overall Site experience. A cookie is a piece of data
stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user.
Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you.  </p>

<h4>Others' Information</h4>
<p>You may decide to provide us with
another person's email address so that person may be invited to join
GoAnimate. We use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind
that person that he or she has been invited to join GoAnimate. All invitees
are provided with the option not to receive further invitations from
GoAnimate. We may disclose such information if required to do so in
order to comply with legal process, as described below.</p>

<h4>Disclosure</h4>
<p>We do not sell or rent your personally
identifiable information to any third party. We may however provide
your personally identifiable information and the data generated by cookies
and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that
we may engage to assist us.  For example, we may provide your personally
identifiable information to a marketing, research and/or advertising
agency to notify you of new product releases, service notifications,
and to solicit your feedback and input on our behalf.  We will
disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe
we are required to do so by law or regulation or in cooperation with
any governmental investigation.  We may transfer your personally
identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation
or other corporate reorganization in which GoAnimate participates or
to a purchaser of all or substantially all of GoAnimate's assets to
which this Site relates.  </p>

<h4>Links to Third Party Sites</h4>
<p>The Site may provide links to
other Web sites or resources over which GoAnimate does not have control
("External Web Sites").  Such links do not constitute
an endorsement by GoAnimate of those External Web Sites.  You acknowledge
that GoAnimate is providing these links to you only as a convenience,
and further agree that GoAnimate is not responsible for the content
of such External Web Sites.  Your use of External Web Sites is
subject to the terms of use and privacy policies located on the linked
to External Web Sites.</p>

<h4>Security</h4>
<p>We may employ procedural and technological
security measures that are reasonably designed to help protect your
personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access,
disclosure, alteration or destruction.  GoAnimate may use secure
socket layer, firewalls, password protection, and other security measures
to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable
information.  </p>
<h4>Users Outside of the United States</h4>
<p>Our computer systems are currently
based in the United States, so your personal data will be processed
by us in the United States where data protection and privacy regulations
may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the
world, such as the European Union.  If you create a user account
with the Site as a visitor from outside the United States, by using
the Site you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer
of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an
equivalent level of protection of that required in the European Union
or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information
as described in this Privacy Policy. </p>

<h4>Correction/Updating Personally Identifiable Information </h4>
<p>GoAnimate provides you with the
ability to review, correct and delete your contact information.
If you wish to review or correct any information you have provided to
us, you may access your account online.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding
this Privacy Policy please contact us via email at privacy-support@GoAnimate.com.  </p>

April 1, 2008</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is effective
as of: April 1, 2008</p>
