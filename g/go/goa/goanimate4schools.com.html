<h1>
    GoAnimate, Inc.
    <br>
    GoAnimate for Schools COPPA Policy
</h1>
<p>
    <b>Effective Date</b>: 7/20/2015
</p>
<p>
    GoAnimate for Schools, provided by GoAnimate, Inc. (“GoAnimate for Schools”,
    “we”, “us”, or “our”) recognizes the importance of the privacy of children
    and of all of its users. This COPPA Privacy Policy (“COPPA Policy”) is
    designed to comply with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
    (COPPA) and contains important information for teachers, parents, and
    children about how we collect, use, and disclose the personal information of
    users of our website
    <a href="https://goanimate4schools.com/">goanimate4schools.com</a> (the
    “Site”) and the services available through our Site (collectively, the
    “Services”), including information from children under thirteen (13) years
    of age and teachers.
</p>
<p>
    While COPPA only applies to personal information collected from children
    under thirteen (13), GoAnimate for Schools is designed for use by persons
    under eighteen (18) years of age. Therefore, for purposes of this COPPA
    Policy, “student” or “students” means a “child” or “children” under eighteen
    (18).
</p>
<p>
    At GoAnimate, we provide tools for teachers and students to create animated
    videos. When a teacher uses our Services in the classroom or an educational
    setting to sign students up to GoAnimate, the teacher is required to provide
    consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from
    students and is required to affirm to us that they have the authority to do
    so.
</p>
<p>
    Students’ personal information will be handled as described in this COPPA
    Policy. Use of our Site or Services, and any dispute over privacy, is
    subject to this COPPA Policy and our
    <a href="https://goanimate4schools.com/termsofuse">Terms of Service</a>,
    including its applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of
    disputes. Our <a href="https://goanimate4schools.com/termsofuse">Terms of
    Service</a> are incorporated by reference into this COPPA Policy.

</ul>
<h2 id="how-we-disclose-information">How We Disclose Information</h2>

</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>GoAnimate for
        Schools Users.</b> Teachers already know the login credentials of
        their students. Teachers will also have access to student videos and
        may be able to moderate their creation, editing, or deletion.
        Students and teachers may also message other students and/or
        teachers within our Services.
    </li>

        person, violations of our
        <a href="https://goanimate4schools.com/termsofuse">Terms of Service
        </a> or this COPPA Policy, or as evidence in litigation in which we
        are involved.

    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cookies-and-other-tracking-mechanisms">
    Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
</h2>
<p>
    We and our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to
    track information about our users’ use of our Site or Services. We or our
    service providers may combine this information with other personal
    information we collect from our users.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Do Not Track.
        </b> Our Site does not respond to Do Not Track signals and we may
        track a user’s activities once s/he leaves our Site. Users may
        disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by
        disabling cookies).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Cookies.</b>
        We or our service providers may use cookies to track visitor
        activity on our Site. A cookie is a text file that a website
        transfers to a user’s computer’s hard drive for record-keeping
        purposes. We or our service providers may use cookies to track user
        activities on our Site, such as the pages visited and time spent on
        our Site. Most browsers allow users to refuse cookies. The Help
        portion of the toolbar on most browsers can inform users about how
        to prevent their computer from accepting new cookies, how to have
        the browser notify a user upon receipt a new cookie, or how to
        disable cookies altogether. Users of our Site and Services who
        disable cookies may not be able to browse certain areas of the Site.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Clear GIFs,
            pixel tags and other technologies.</b> Clear GIFs are tiny
            graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to
            cookies, which are embedded invisibly on web pages. We or our
            service providers may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons,
            web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to track
            the activities of our users, help us manage content, and compile
            statistics about usage of our Site. We or our service providers
            may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our users, to help us
            track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed,
            and track whether our emails are forwarded.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Third-Party
        Analytics.</b> We use third-party service providers, such as
        Google Analytics and Hubspot, to evaluate the use of our Site and
        our Services. We or our service providers use automated devices and
        applications to evaluate use of our Site and Services. We or our
        service providers use these tools to help us improve our Site,
        Services, performance, and user experiences. These entities may use
        cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or
        Flash LSO, to perform their services.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-generated-content">User-Generated Content</h2>
<p>
    Users can create content on our Site or Services, such as by creating videos
    using the assets we provide and importing their own assets (such as image
    and audio files) for inclusion in these videos. Teachers control the sharing
    and distribution settings for the videos created by their students. If a
    user publishes his/her video on our Site or Services, the video and
    information contained within will be available to other users to the extent
    agreed upon between GoAnimate for Schools and the user’s teacher,
    classmates, school, district, or other similar person or entity. We cannot
    prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this
    COPPA Policy, the law, or our user’s personal privacy.  If a teacher
    downloads or exports a video, the resulting video file does not reside on
    our Site or Services and is no longer governed by this Policy.
</p>
<h2 id="third-party-links">Third-Party Links</h2>
<p>
    Our Site and Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access
    to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this COPPA Policy but
    instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites.
    We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party
    websites.
</p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>
    We have taken steps to help protect the information we collect from loss,
    misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
    However, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security. Users should
    take steps to protect against unauthorized access to their accounts by,
    among other things, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can
    easily guess and keeping their log-in and password private. We are not
    responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any
    activity on an account via unauthorized password activity.
</p>
<h2 id="rights-to-review-delete-and-control-our-use-of-students-personal-information">
    Rights to Review, Delete, and Control Our Use of Students’ Personal
    Information
</h2>
<p>
    Teachers have a right to review the personal information we have collected
    about their students, to delete it, and to tell us to no longer use or
    disclose it. Teachers can review most of the personal information we collect
    about their students by logging in to their accounts and reviewing their
    account information and updating the personal information we maintain about
    their students. If a teacher does not want us to collect and use his/her
    student’s personal information anymore, then the teacher may cancel the
    student’s account and the student’s use of the Services.
</p>
<p>
    Parents may also contact us at schools@goanimate4schools.com to request
    access to their child’s information or cancellation of their child’s
    account. After liaising with that child’s teacher, we will endeavor to honor
    a parent’s request.

    GoAnimate, Inc.
    <br>
    GoAnimate for Schools Direct Notice to Teachers
</h1>
<p>
    Dear Teacher [Principal, School Administrator, etc.],
</p>
<p>
    You wish to sign your students up to use GoAnimate for Schools, provided by
    GoAnimate, Inc. (“GoAnimate for Schools”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), which
    provides tools for teachers and students to create animated videos through
    our website <a href="https://goanimate4schools.com/">goanimate4schools.com
    </a> (the “Site”) and the services available through our Site (collectively,
    the “Services”).
</p>
<p>
    We are required to provide you with this notice (“Direct Notice”) and obtain
    your consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your students’
    personal information pursuant to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection
    Act (COPPA).
</p>
<p>
    While COPPA only applies to personal information collected from children
    under thirteen (13), GoAnimate for Schools is designed for use by persons
    under eighteen (18) years of age.  Therefore, for purposes of this Direct
    Notice, “student” or “students” means a “child” or “children” under eighteen
    (18). This Direct Notice applies to the personal information we collect from
    students and describes how we collect, use, and disclose such information
    via the GoAnimate for Schools Site and Services.
</p>
<h2>Consent Under COPPA</h2>
<p>
    Under COPPA, teachers [principals, school administrator, etc.] may consent
    to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from their
    students who are under thirteen (13) , with respect to online tools that the
    teacher and students use in a classroom setting or otherwise in the
    educational context. In order to use the GoAnimate for Schools Site and
    Services in the classroom, you must:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Be the teacher [principal, school administrator, etc.] for any
        student whom you sign up to our Services;
    </li>
    <li>
        Be acting in your capacity as a teacher [principal, school
        administrator, etc.];
    </li>
    <li>
        Have the authority to consent to the collection of personal
        information from your students;
    </li>
    <li>Affirm all of the above.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Rights to Review, Delete, and Control Our Use of Students’ Personal
    Information
</h2>
<p>
    Teachers have a right to review the personal information we have collected
    about their students, to delete it, and to tell us to no longer use or
    disclose it. Teachers can review most of the personal information we collect
    about their students by logging in to their accounts and reviewing their
    account information and updating the personal information we maintain about
    their students. If a teacher does not want us to collect and use his/her
    student’s personal information anymore, then the teacher may cancel the
    student’s account and the student’s use of the Services.
</p>
<p>
    Parents may also contact us at schools@goanimate4schools.com to request
    access to their child’s information or cancellation of their child’s
    account. After liaising with that child’s teacher, we will endeavor to
    honor a parent’s request.
</p>
<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
    <b>How Information is
    Collected.</b> We collect information about students directly from
    students or from their teachers, as well as automatically through a
    student’s use of our Site or Services. We will not require a student to
    disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to use our Services.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Information We Collect
    Directly from Students.</b> We collect the login credentials for students
    provided to us by teachers, which may include a student’s name or email
    address. If a student chooses to record his/her own voice in an animation or
    otherwise input information into our Services (e.g., text-to-speech language
    to help narrate a video), we also collect that student’s voice recording or
    other information.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Information We Collect
    Automatically.</b> We may automatically collect the following information
    about students’ use of our Site through cookies and other technologies:
    domain name; browser type; browser language; device ID; operating system
    type; device name and model; pages or screens viewed; links clicked; IP
    address; when and the length of time a user visits or uses our Services; and
    the referring URL, or the webpage that led a user to our Site.
</p>
<h2>How We Use Students’ Information</h2>
<p>
    We use students’ personal information to provide our Services, communicate
    with users, analyze use of our service, and to comply with the law.
</p>
<h2>How We Disclose Students’ Information </h2>
<p>
    We disclose students’ personal information to other GoAnimate for School users (e.g., so students and teachers may message each other on our Site); to service providers who perform functions on our behalf; as part of a business transfer; in response to legal process; to protect us and others; and in the aggregate or in a de-identified format.
</p>
<p>
    To learn more about our privacy practices, please review our COPPA Policy.
</p>
