<h3>2.2 when you visit a go ape adventure site</h3><p>You can make a booking for any of our Go Ape adventures on our website, by contacting our call centre, or when you arrive at a Go Ape site. Before you can take part in your Go Ape adventure, you will need to sign a disclaimer, possibly more than one if you have additional support needs. Sometimes we may ask your permission to take photos and video footage of you experiencing your Go Ape adventure for use in our marketing. If you are involved in an accident or incident we have a process that we need you to follow, which will include the potential collection of additional information.</p><p><b>MAKE A BOOKING</b></p><p><b>What information do we collect?</b></p><p>When you make a booking with us, whether online, by phone, with our call centre or on site, we require certain personal information to deal with your booking. The following is generally required as minimum: name, email address, phone number, postal address, and payment card details or information relating to your company for group bookings. If you have any additional needs, you may need to provide more information.</p><p><b>Why and how do we use it?</b></p><p>The information we request from you is required to finalise your booking including taking your payment, and to ensure we can provide your activity. If you require additional physical assistance to access and enjoy the activities we offer, the extra information you give to us will help. It also helps us to comply under equality legislation.</p><p><b>Where do we look after it?</b></p><p>We keep your information in our booking system and customer databases, operated by our hosting providers.</p><p><b>Who do we share it with?</b></p><p>We will also share certain details with other companies that we work with under contract to process your payment and fulfil your booking, such as with our payment partner.</p><p>After your Go Ape adventure, we share your email address with our customer experience partner, Trust Pilot, which invites you to review and post your experience with us on their platform.</p><p><b>How long do we keep it for?</b></p><p>We keep your details for a minimum of five years after your Go Ape adventure.</p><p><b>AGREE TO HAVE YOUR PHOTO TAKEN AND USED</b></p><p><b>What information do we collect?</b></p><p>If you give your consent to having photos or video taken we will ask for the following information: name, email address, mobile number, signature and whether you are under 16 or not. For children under 16, we will collect these details for the parent/guardian of each child, plus the name of the child(ren).</p><p><b>Why and how do we use it?</b></p><p>We may use these images across our full range of marketing and media channels and applications which promote and publicise Go Ape. This may include digital and print content and materials such as our website, blog, social media, posters, advertisements, email content, leaflets and other publicity materials.</p><p>Footage will not be used in conjunction with any other information that could identify you, unless we have gained your express permission beforehand. Such instances could include for a press article which may name you, or as a competition winner on a social media channel.</p><p><b>Where do we look after it?</b></p><p>We keep all footage that we are actively using on servers operated by our hosting provider. Once we stop using the photos and video, we will destroy most of it but will keep selected footage that we used as a historical archive on the same servers.</p><p><b>Who do we share it with?</b></p><p>We will not sell the images but may share them with third parties, as may be needed in the production and dissemination of our marketing materials, such as designers, printers, advertisers, journalists, third party re-sellers. We may also share them with other companies and organisations with whom we engage in joint promotional activities, such as suppliers of other leisure services or products. Images used on our social media channels may also be shared by our active followers. Although we have clear terms of use of materials set out in our Website Terms of Use Policy it is possible that other third parties will take and use images on our website or other digital channels without our permission – that’s just the nature of the web.</p><p><b>How long do we keep it for?</b></p><p>Go Ape has a policy to actively use images for up to 10 years. Again, due to the nature of the web, some images may remain ‘out there’ for longer. We may also keep images that have been used in marketing activity in our archive library as a historic record of our brand and promotional development and these may remain indefinitely. </p><p><b>RISK ACKNOWLEDGEMENT DISCLAIMERS</b></p><p><b>What information do we collect?</b></p><p>When you book a Go Ape adventure with us, you will be asked to read and sign a Risk Acknowledgement and Disclaimer for each activity, providing your name, age and signature. A parent, guardian or carer must sign for each child under 16 years of age that they are supervising.</p><p><b>Why and how do we use it?</b></p><p>We ask for this information to ensure you have read and understood the risks of taking part in the activity, as they can all be dangerous if instructions and safety measures are not followed. The forms are used in the event of any claim and helps improve safety standards by tracking any accidents, should they occur.</p><p><b>Where do we look after it?</b></p><p>We save the information on the paper form you signed and keep it in the booking office onsite for three months after your visit. The forms are then moved to our central storage facility.</p><p><b>Who do we share it with?</b></p><p>We do not share this information unless you have an accident whist at a Go Ape site or other issue that needs to be investigated in which case we may need to share the form with, for example, parents of a child you were supervising, our solicitors or insurers, or other agencies as may be required by law – see ‘Sharing due to legal requirements’ section below.</p><p><b>How long do we keep it for?</b></p><p>Forms will be kept for a period sufficient to cover Limitation Act claims. Consequently, most forms will be kept for four years. Those relating to individuals under the age of 18 may be kept until they are 21 years of age.</p><p><b>MEDICAL AND RELIGIOUS DISCLAIMERS</b></p><p><b>What information do we collect?</b></p><p>When you book a Go Ape adventure with us, if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or needs, cultural or religious traditions that impact your ability to safely take part in the activity, you will be asked to read and sign an additional disclaimer. In each instance we will collect your name and signature, but some forms require additional information. Each child under 18 years of age must be signed for by either a parent, guardian or carer, dependent on the disclaimer.</p><p><b>Why and how do we use it?</b></p><p>We issue disclaimers for the following:</p><p>Religious headwear - If you are unable or unwilling to wear the protective helmets for our Forest Segway experience, due to a cultural or religious tradition of wearing a headscarf or turban, we will ask you to sign a form declaring this.</p><p>Pregnancy - If you are pregnant but still wish to take part in an activity we will ask you to sign a form declaring this.</p><p>Existing physical injury or condition - If you have a pre-existing injury or condition but still wish to take part in an activity we will ask you to sign a form declaring this including providing details of the injury or condition. </p><p>Hearing impaired - If you have hearing difficulties we will agree with you any additional adjustments to the safety brief to assure your safety and will ask you to sign a form agreeing to follow these rules.</p><p>Additional needs - If you have a medical or physical disability we will ask you to declare the needs which are to be accommodated. We may agree to provide you with additional assistance or increased supervision and will ask you to sign a form agreeing to this.</p><p>We ask for this information to ensure you have read and understood the additional risks of taking part in the activity. This is a legal requirement to ensure:</p><ul><li>we have brought the risks to your attention;</li><li>where appropriate we have devised additional support in accordance with your specific conditions;</li><li>you have understood and accepted any additional risks and agree to any additional rules and support.</li></ul><p>The forms are used in the event of any claim and to help improve safety standards by tracking any accidents, should they occur.</p><p><b>Where do we look after it?</b></p><p>We save the information on the paper form you signed and keep it in the booking office onsite for three months after your visit.

Those relating to individuals under the age of 18 may be kept until they are 21 years of age.</p><p><b>ACCIDENTS AND INCIDENTS</b></p><p><b>What information do we collect?</b></p><p>If you have an accident whether causing injury or not, we will collect details on a form about the event including at minimum your name, age, gender, address, phone number and the same for the adult who was supervising you and any other customers involved but not injured.</p><p>Similarly, if you are involved in an incident we will collect your name, age, gender, address, phone number.</p><p>It may also be necessary to take injury details, witness statements and photographs to document what happened.</p><p><b>Why and how do we use it?</b></p><p>We will collect this information so that we can comply with our policies and any legal requirements to investigate what happened, ensure our first-aider and any other medical professionals tending to you can provide you with the appropriate care, and take any other administrative actions required. It is required by law to keep a record of accidents and treatment, and to register attendance by a medical professional. The forms are also used in the event of any claim and to help improve safety standards by tracking any accidents, should they occur.</p><p><b>Where do we look after it?</b></p><p>We transfer the information on the paper form to an online database operated by our hosting partners as soon as possible and destroy the paper copies. On occasion, some paper copies are moved to our central storage facility, together with any disclaimers you would have signed. </p><p><b>Who do we share it with?</b></p><p>We do not share this information unless with, for example, medical personnel if you need medical attention; our solicitors or other agencies as may be required by law – see ‘Sharing due to legal requirements’ section below. </p><p><b>How long do we keep it for?</b></p><p>We keep the information in case there is a claim about the cause of the accident and/or the treatments received. information will be kept for a period sufficient to cover Limitation Act claims.
