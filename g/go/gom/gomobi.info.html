            <h2>4. Use of Internet</h2>

            <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure.

We are not in a position to establish whether your personal information is accurate or up-to-date and cannot, therefore, be responsible for doing so. Any information which you provide in this way is not made available to any third parties, and is used by us for internal business purposes only.

            We reserve the right to transfer ownership of the website (including personal information you submit) to a third party in the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of us, a subsidiary or line of business associated with us.</p>

This is to prevent third parties from gaining unauthorised access to a user’s account and is for users’ own protection.<br><br>

            You should note that technical details which we cannot associate with any identifiable individual do not constitute "personal data" for the purposes of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.<br><br>
