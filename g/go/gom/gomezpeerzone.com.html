<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><b>Information Collection and Use </b><br>
              Gomez, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected 
              on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information 
              to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 
              Gomez, Inc. collects information from our users at 
              several different points on our website. Registration will be required 
              to access certain portions of our website, but is not required to 
              use this website.
</p><p><b>Reward Programs</b><br>
              Participants in the Gomez PEER program may be eligible to participate 
              in reward programs that allow users to earn money. Any such payments 
              to users will be issued through a third-party payment fulfillment 
              provider. Gomez's current third-party payment fulfillment provider 
              is PayPal. To enable this provider to properly issue payments to 
              users, Gomez will disclose the e-mail address of eligible users 
              and the cash amount to be paid. Because this privacy policy only 
              addresses the practices of Gomez, and because Gomez 
              cannot govern the practices of third parties, we urge you to read 
              the privacy policy of our third party provider.</p>

            <p><b>Referral Programs</b><br>
              When you sign up for a Gomez PEER account, you will have the ability 
              to <a class="b2g" href="referral.php">refer your friends</a> to the program. If people you refer subsequently join the Gomez PEER program, indicate you as the referrer, and meet the eligibility requirements, you will be eligible for a cash referral bonus. Please use our referral program responsibly.</p>
            <p><b>Cookies</b><br>
              Cookies may be used on this site to allow for movement between secure 
              sections. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard 
              drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is 
              in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while 
              on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply 
              terminates. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our 
              site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited 
              in some areas of our site.</p>
            <p><b>Log Files</b><br>

              We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track 
              users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate 
              use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
            <p><b>Sharing</b><br>
              We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners 
              and/or customers. This is not linked to any personal information 
              that can identify any individual person. For customers that order 
              Gomez's peerReview service using a credit card, we must share 
              the credit card information with a bank card merchant service provider 
              (RBC Centura Bank), the appropriate credit card clearinghouse (Visa, 
              MasterCard, and American Express), and an online payment processing 
              service (VeriSign) in order to process the transaction. Gomez never 
              stores or shares the credit card information with any other third 
              parties.</p>
            <p><b>Links</b><br>
              This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that 
              Gomez, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices 
              of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they 
              leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every 
              website that collects personally identifiable information. This 
              privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this 
              Website. </p>
            <p><b>Mailing List</b> <br>

              If a user wishes to subscribe to our mailing list, we ask for contact 
              information such as name and e-mail address. From time to time, 
              our site may request feedback from users via surveys. Participation 
              in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore 
              has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Survey 
              information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving 
              the use and satisfaction of this site. Please see our "Choice/Opt-out" 
              below. </p>
            <p><b>Security </b><br>
              Gomez takes every precaution to protect our users' information. 
              When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information 
              is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/login 
              forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as account 
              information), that information is encrypted and is protected with 
              the most widely used encryption software in the industry - SSL. 
              While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers 
              such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes 
              locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 
              To learn more about SSL, follow this link <a class="b2g" href="http://www.ssl.com">www.ssl.com</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, 
              we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. 
              All of our users' information is restricted in our offices and our 
              service provider's offices. Only employees who need the information 
              to perform a specific job (for example, our technical team or a 
              customer service representative) are granted access to personally 
              identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date 
              on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as 
              any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or 
              reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they 
              can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, 
              the servers that we store personally identifiable information on 
              are kept in a secure environment. </p>
            <p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, 
              please visit our <a class="b2g" href="contact.php">Contact Us</a> page. 
            </p>

            <p><b>Special Offers</b><br>
              We send all registered Gomez PEER users a welcoming e-mail to verify 
              password and username. We may occasionally send registered users 
              information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. 
              Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option 
              to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice 
              and opt-out below. </p>
            <p><b>Administrative Updates </b><br>
              We also send administrative updates to registered Gomez PEER users, 
              and customers of Gomez's peerReview service. We communicate 
              with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues 
              relating to their account via e-mail. Members are not able to unsubscribe 
              from administrative updates, which contain important information 
              about the service. Administrative update e-mails will include information 
              such as important software and site upgrades, system status information 
              and scheduled downtime. Administrative update e-mails do not contain 
              advertising information. </p>
            <p><b>Correction/Updating Personal Information</b><br>
              If a user's personally identifiable information changes, or if a 
              user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide 
              a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided 
              to us. Gomez PEER users can change their account password and e-mail 
              address, ZIP code and country through the Gomez PEER Custom Homepage. 
              This page is accessible via the "Gomez PEERs" section 
              of the Web site after logging in with username and password. If 
              a user no longer desires our service, they can unsubscribe from 
              the Gomez PEER program by visiting our <a class="b2g" href="contact.php">Contact Us</a> page. 
            </p>

            <p><b>Choice/Opt-out </b><br>
              If information will be used for purposes not directly related to 
              our site, our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out.' Users 
              who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt-out of receiving 
              these communications by visiting our <a class="b2g" href="contact.php">Contact Us</a> page.
              Gomez PEER users can also opt-out of newsletters and leaderboards 
              through the Gomez PEER Custom Homepage. This page is accessible 
              via the "Gomez Peers" section of the Web site after logging 
              in with username and password. </p>
            <p><b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
              If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will prominently post 
              changes on our homepage so that our users are always aware of what 
              information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, 
              if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally 
              identifiable information in a manner different from that stated 
              at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an 
              e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their 
              information in this different manner. We will use information in 
              accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was 
              collected.</p>
            <p><b>Legal Disclaimer </b><br>

              Gomez may disclose personal information when required by law or 
              in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order 
              to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process 
              served on our website. <br>
