<h4>WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS:</h4>

<br>
In connection with using our Services, we may collect information from you which can be used to identify you, such as your name, address, email address, phone, date of birth, gender, username and password ("Personal Data").  This Privacy Policy explains what Personal Data about you we collect from you and others, and how we use it.  As you use our Services, we want you to be clear how we are using your information and the ways in which you can protect your Personal Data.
<br>
<br>

<li>How We Use the Personal Data We Collect</li>
<li>How to Access and Control Your Personal Data</li>
</ol>
<br>
By using our Services, you explicitly consent to the use of Personal Data for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.  If at any time you object to any of these uses of Personal Data, you should stop using our Services and notify us that permission for any use of your Personal Data is withdrawn.  If you opt-out of the use of your Personal Data, you will not be able to use our Services.
<br>
<br>
<h4>WHY WE COLLECT AND USE PERSONAL DATA:</h4>
<br>
We use your Personal Data with your consent and in furtherance of our legitimate interests, including providing you with any Services you have requested or authorized.

<br>
<br>
<h4>WHAT PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT:</h4>
<br>
We may collect Personal Data in the following ways:
<br>
<ol>
<li>Information You Provide.  Many of our Services require you provide your Personal Data, including to register for a GotSoccer Account. When you register, we may ask for personal information, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, gender, birth date and other personal information necessary for you to participate on your team, club, state association and national organization.  You may also provide us Personal Data when you request our Services or report a problem with our Services.</li>

<li>Information Your Team, Club, State or National Association Gives Us About You.   GotSoccer may collect and process Personal Data provided by our clients, which may include your team, club, association, state association, national organization, and other similar organizations (collectively "GotSoccer Clients").

For example, your team's manager, coach or your club may provide us, with your consent, your player information and other Personal Data to register you for a tournament or a league.
    Your club may authorize your team manager, team coach or other representatives to access your Personal Data for the purposes of administering your team.
    If a GotSoccer Client provides any of your Personal Data to us, the GotSoccer Client is responsible for providing any notices and/or obtaining any consents necessary from you for us to access and use the Personal Data.  We do not control information collection or use practices of GotSoccer Clients.
	Please contact your team, club, association, state association, national organization, or other organizations regarding their own privacy policies.  Once your Personal Data is provided to us by a GotSoccer Client, you may access and control your Personal Data pursuant to the provisions of this Privacy Policy.</li>

	In this regard, we use Google Analytics to better understand how our customers navigate to and through our websites, how long customers spend visiting our content items and how often they return to visit our websites.
	You may set your browser to block all cookies; however, it's important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<br>

<br>
<ol>

The privacy and data protection laws and rules regarding when government authorities may access data may vary from those in the country in which you live.</li>

<li>Application of Privacy Policy.  Our Privacy Policy applies to all the sites, services and applications offered by GotSoccer and its affiliates, but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy. For example, clubs (and coaches/administrators authorized by clubs), associations, and state associations may, with your consent, export your Personal Data  to comply with obligations from the United States Soccer Federation (USSF), U.S. Youth Soccer (USYS) or other similar organizations.  Our Privacy Policy does not extend to data and its use once exported, with your consent, from GotSoccer to your club, association, state association or national association.  Please contact your club, association, state organization, USSF, USYS or others regarding their own privacy policies.</li>

<li>Changes to Privacy Policy.  We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy, which may change from time to time. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes).</li>

<li>Third-Party Links.  Our website, services and applications may link to other sites that we do not control.  In addition, you may have visited our website through a link or a banner advertisement on another site.  In such cases, the site you linked from may collect your information. These third-party sites are governed by their own privacy policies. Be sure to review these privacy policies when visiting such sites to see how they collect and use this information. We are not responsible for the content of privacy practices of such third-party sites.</li>

<li>'Do Not Track' Notifications.  Some browsers allow you to automatically notify websites you visit not to track you using a "Do Not Track" signal. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser.</li>

If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected Personal Data from a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete it, unless we are legally obligated to retain such data.  When you use our Services, you may provide us with Personal Data regarding your minor child.

Contact us if you believe that we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected information from a child under the age of 13.
