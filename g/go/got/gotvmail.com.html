					Only employees who need the information to perform a

					identifiable information.&nbsp; Our employees must use 
					password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.&nbsp; 
					When they return, they must re-enter their password to 
					re-gain access to user information.&nbsp; Furthermore, ALL 
					employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy

					policies are added, our employees are notified and/or 
					reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what
