<h2>Information Collection</h2>
<p>GotVMail   					Communications is the sole owner of the information   					collected on www.GotVMail.com. GotVMail Communications   					collects information from our users at several different   					points on our Web site.</p>
<h2>Order</h2>
<p>We request information from   					the user on our order form. A user must provide contact   					information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and   					financial information (such as credit card number,   					expiration date).&nbsp; This information is used for billing   					purposes and to fill customer’s orders.&nbsp; If we have   					trouble processing an order, the information is used to   					contact the user.</p>
<h2>Information Use</h2>
<p>Information collected is used   					only for setting up service and conveying information about   					user accounts and upcoming features and benefits of GotVMail   					programs. </p>
<h2>Profile</h2>
<p>We store   					information that we collect through cookies, log files,   					clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our   					users.&nbsp; A profile is stored information that we keep on   					individual users that details their viewing preferences.&nbsp;   					Consequently, collected information is tied to the users   					personally identifiable information to provide offers and   					improve the content of the site for the user. This profile   					is used to tailor a user’s visit to our Web site, and to   					direct pertinent marketing promotions to them.&nbsp; We do   					not share your profile with other third parties.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie   					is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to   					information about the user.&nbsp; Usage of a cookie is in no   					way linked to any personally identifiable information while   					on our site.&nbsp; We use cookies on this site.</p>
<p><strong>Log   					Files</strong></p>
<p> Like most standard Web site   					servers we use log files.&nbsp; This includes internet   					protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service   					provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type,   					date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends,   					administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate,   					and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.&nbsp;   					IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable   					information.&nbsp;We use a tracking utility called "analog 4.13"   					that uses log files to analyze user movement.</p>
<p><u><strong> Communications from the Site</strong></u></p>
<h2>Special Offers and Updates</h2>
<p>We send   					all new members a welcoming email to verify password and   					username. Established members will occasionally receive   					information on products, services, special deals, and a   					newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we   					present the option to not receive these types of   					communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.</p>
<h2> Newsletter</h2>
<p>If a user   					wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact   					information such as name and email address.&nbsp; Out of   					respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of   					these communications.&nbsp; Please see the Choice and   					Opt-out sections. </p>
<h2>Service Announcements</h2>
<p>On rare   					occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service   					related announcement.&nbsp; For instance, if our service is   					temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an   					email.&nbsp; Generally, users may not opt-out of these   					communications, though they can deactivate their account.&nbsp;   					However, these communications are not promotional in nature.&nbsp;   					&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Customer Service</h2>
<p> We communicate with users on a   					regular basis to provide requested services and in regards   					to issues relating to their account we reply via email or   					phone, in accordance with the users wishes.</p>
<p><u><strong>Sharing</strong></u></p>
<h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Though we   					make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to   					disclose personal information when required by law wherein   					we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to   					comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or   					legal process served on our Web site.</p>
<h2> Third Party Advertisers</h2>
<p>GotVMail   					Communications DOES NOT share Web site usage information   					about users with a reputable third party. GotVMail may share   					general customer information but never call records or usage   					statistics to partners who have signed a non-disclosure   					agreement for the sole purpose of establishing a partnership   					agreement. This data may include customer name and address.</p>
<h2>Service Providers</h2>
<p>We do not   					partner with other third party Systems to provide toll free services. When the user signs up   					for these particular services, we share names, or all   					contact information that is necessary for the third party to   					provide these services.&nbsp; These third parties are not   					allowed to use personally identifiable information except   					for the purpose of providing these services.</p>
<h2> Business Transitions</h2>
<p>In the   					event GotVMail Communications goes through a business   					transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another   					company, or selling a portion of its assets, users’ personal   					information will, in most instances, be part of the assets   					transferred.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>This Web   					site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we,   					GotVMail Communications, are not responsible for the privacy   					practices of such other sites.&nbsp; We encourage our users   					to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy   					statements of each and every Web site that collects   					personally identifiable information.&nbsp; This privacy   					statement applies solely to information collected by this   					Web site. </p>
<p><strong>Surveys &amp; Contests</strong></p>
<p>From   					time-to-time our site requests information from users via   					surveys or contests.&nbsp; Participation in these surveys or   					contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has   					a choice whether or not to disclose this information.&nbsp;   					The requested information typically includes contact   					information (such as name and shipping address), and   					demographic information (such as zip code).&nbsp; Contact   					information will be used to notify the winners and award   					prizes.&nbsp; Survey information will be used for purposes   					of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this   					site.&nbsp; Users’ personally identifiable information is   					not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice   					and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct   					these surveys or contests, they may not use users’   					personally identifiable information for any secondary   					purposes. </p>
<h2>Refer an Entrepreneur</h2>
<p> If a user elects to use our   					referral service for informing an entrepreneur or friend about our site, we   					ask them for the entrepreneur’s or friend’s name and email address.&nbsp;   					GotVMail Communications will automatically send the entrepreneur or friend a   					one-time email inviting them to visit the site.&nbsp;   					GotVMail Communications&nbsp; does not store this   					information; it is used for the sole purpose of sending this one-time   					email and tracking the success of our referral program.&nbsp;   					The friend may contact GotVMail Communications by <a href="http://support.gotvmail.net/index.php?_m=tickets&amp;_a=submit">submitting a ticket</a> to request the removal of this   					information from our database. </p>
<h2>Chat Rooms, Message   					Boards, and Public Forums</h2>
<p>Please   					keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal   					information online - for example on message boards, through   					e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected   					and used by others. In short, by posting personal   					information online that is publicly accessible, you may   					receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p> This Web site takes every   					precaution to protect our users’ information.&nbsp; When   					users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their   					information is protected both online and off-line.</p>
<p>When our registration/order   					form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as   					credit card number and/or social security number), that   					information is encrypted and is protected with the best   					encryption software in the industry - SSL.&nbsp; While on a   					secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the   					bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and   					Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to   					un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’. </p>
<p>While we use SSL encryption to   					protect sensitive information online, we also do everything   					in our power to protect user-information off-line.&nbsp; All   					of our users’ information, not just the sensitive   					information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.&nbsp;   					Only employees who need the information to perform a   					specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer   					service representative) are granted access to personally   					identifiable information.&nbsp; Our employees must use   					password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.&nbsp;   					When they return, they must re-enter their password to   					re-gain access to user information.&nbsp; Furthermore, ALL   					employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy   					practices.&nbsp; Every quarter, as well as any time new   					policies are added, our employees are notified and/or   					reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what   					they can do to ensure our users’ information is protected.&nbsp;   					Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable   					information are in a secure environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If users have any questions   					about the security at our Web site, users can <a href="http://support.gotvmail.net/index.php?_m=tickets&amp;_a=submit">submit a ticket</a> to our Customer Support Center. </p>
<h2>Supplementation of Information </h2>
<p>In order for this Web site to   					properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for   					us to supplement the information we receive with information   					from 3rd party sources.</p>
<h2> Address Verification</h2>
<p>We use   					Authorize.net to verify a user’s address for credit card   					authentication purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<h2> Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal   					Information</h2>
<p>If a   					user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as   					zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no   					longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct,   					update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable   					information. This can usually be done by <a href="http://support.gotvmail.net/index.php?_m=tickets&amp;_a=submit">submitting a ticket</a> to our   					Customer Support Center.</p>
<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
<p> If we decide to change our   					privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy   					statement, the homepage, and other places we deem   					appropriate so our users are always aware of what   					information we collect, how we use it, and under what   					circumstances, if any, we disclose it.&nbsp;</p>
<h2> Contact Information</h2>
<p>If users   					have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy   					policy, please contact us at:</p>
