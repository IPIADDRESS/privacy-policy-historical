    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p>GoToQuiz.com is committed to maintaining high standards of privacy for its visitors. 
    This document describes the ways in which we respect visitor privacy.</p>
    
    <br>
    <b>Information GoToQuiz stores:</b>

    <p>Our server logs the visitor's IP address and certain browser headers as part of the 
    standard logging proccess that most web sites follow. This data is stored only in log 
    form and is used to generate aggregate reports on visitor use of the site. Information 
    such as real names and e-mail addresses are not collected by simply visiting GoToQuiz.com, 
    and in fact are not possible to collect without a visitor actually volunteering that information.</p>
    
    <p>When taking quizzes at GoToQuiz.com, if you have not created a GoToQuiz account, no quiz results 
    are linked to you in any way unless you have opted in. Answers to some questions may be 
    logged only to generate aggregate reports, which may be made public.  This data is anonymized. 
    The quiz results of users with GoToQuiz accounts are saved and may be deleted upon 
    request.  Saved results are displayed to the quiz-makers, and are not used for marketing 
    purposes.</p>

    <p>We may collect personal information volunteered by the visitor through the use of HTML forms, 
    and this might include surveys, site registrations, or other form posts.</p>
    <br> 
    <b>What GoToQuiz does with stored information:</b>

    <p>Any information that is volunteered by a visitor is not shared with any third parties unless the visitor 
    has given explicit permission to do so ("opt-in").  Internally, this information 
    may be used to make personalized recommendations (such as quiz recommendations) 
    or to adjust the advertisements that are shown.</p>

    <br>
    <b>How GoToQuiz uses cookies:</b>
    
    <p>Using GoToQuiz.com may result in a cookie being set, which is used to "remember" you 
    from page to page.  This is the essential function of HTTP cookies.  In this case, 
    it allows you to log in to a GoToQuiz account as well as for 
    GoToQuiz.com to make personalized recommendations and show more accurate advertising 
    offers to you during your visit.</p>

    <p>It is possible for you to disable or modify the cookie feature in your browser 
    by consulting your browser's "help" screen, looking up cookies, and following the directions.
    Be aware that disabling cookies will likely disable certain functionality on the sites you visit.</p>
