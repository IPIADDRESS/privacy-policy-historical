<b>How We Use Cookies</b>

A cookie is a small file placed on your computerвЂ™s hard drive that enables us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. Our site and third parties such as advertisers may add a cookie to help analyze web traffic or to determine targeted advertisements based on your preferences.

Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our sites and other sites on the Internet.
