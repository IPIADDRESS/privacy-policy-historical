The “Services” refers to all of the marketing websites and products provided by GetGo, including product websites, mobile apps, and in-product experience. From time to time, GetGo may introduce new products and services. To the extent that these new products and services affect this policy, this policy will be updated. Please see item number 8 for details on how we will notify you of updates to our privacy policy. This privacy policy covers the digital properties listed <a href="https://secure.logmein.com/home/policies/digital-properties-list">here</a>.</p>

GetGo complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>

<p>With respect to personal data received or transferred to the Privacy Shield Framework, GetGo is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

            </ol></li><li><strong>Analytics, Cookies and Other Web Site Technologies</strong></li>
        
    
</ul>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>GetGo is continuously improving our websites and our products and we utilize different third party web analytics tools to help us do so. We are interested in how visitors use our websites, our desktop tools, our mobile applications, what they like and dislike, and where they have problems. We maintain ownership of this data and we do not share this type of data about individual users with third parties.</p>

<p>Geolocation and Other Data:</p>
<p>We may utilize precise Geolocation data but only if you specifically opt-in to collection of such data in connection with a particular service. We also use information such as IP addresses to determine the general geographic locations areas of our visitors. The web beacons used in conjunction with these web analytics tools may gather data such as what browser a person uses, what operating systems are used, domain names, MIME types, what is downloaded, and what content, products and services are reviewed when visiting or registering for services at one of our websites or using one of our mobile applications.</p>

<p>Google Analytics and Adobe Marketing Cloud:</p>
<p>We use Google Analytics as described in <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">“How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.”</a> You can prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics on websites by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>. We also employ IP address masking, a technique used to truncate IP addresses collected by <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">Google Analytics</a> and store them in an abbreviated form to prevent them from being traced back to individual users. Portions of our website may also use Google Analytics for Display Advertisers including DoubleClick or Dynamic Remarketing which provide interest-based ads based on your visit to this or other websites. You can use <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated">Ads Settings</a> to manage the Google ads you see and opt-out of interest-based ads. We also use Adobe Marketing Cloud as described <a href="http://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html#use">here</a>. You can opt-out of use of this information as described below.</p>

<p>Tracking Technologies:</p>
<p>GetGo and our partners use cookies or similar tracking technologies to track user traffic patterns and hold certain registration information. Tracking technologies also used are beacons, tags and scripts to collect and track information and to improve and analyze our service. If you wish to not have the information these technologies collect used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">opt-out here</a>, or if located in the European Union, <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">click here</a>. The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. You can still review the website if you choose to set your browser to refuse all cookies; however, you must enable cookies in order to establish an account and to install the Services.

                <strong>Accessing Your Data</strong>

                <p>GetGo is headquartered in the United States of America and maintains a global infrastructure. Information that we collect and maintain may be transferred to, or controlled and processed in, the United States and/or other countries around the world.

                <p>GetGo follows generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received.
