<h3>1. What is Citrix GoToAssist?</h3>
<p>Citrix® GoToAssist® is an online managed service that enables organizations to provide remote-support assistance to customers and employees over the Internet with speed, ease and security. Two versions of the product are available: GoToAssist® Express™, for individual users, and GoToAssist® Corporate™, for multi-agent teams.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h3>2. What information does GoToAssist collect and how is it used?</h3>
<p>PERSONAL INFORMATION: For online managed accounts, we must collect personal information from users during the registration process, including first and last names, a valid credit card to process payment for service, an email address to be used as a login, a billing address and a password. When a user registers online for a free trial of the service, Citrix Online will take steps to validate the credit card and billing information supplied to us to ensure it is accurate. We use the information collected to deliver services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products and services and to update our records and generally maintain your accounts with us. We do not share, sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties for unknown reasons. We also use this information to determine your eligibility for our one-time free trial offer.</p>
<p>The credit card information supplied will then be used to establish your subscription with us should you decide to continue the service after the free trial has ended. Your email address may be used to send you periodic newsletters from Citrix Online. Users can opt out of promotional emails at any time, but will still receive communications such as receipts, confirmation emails and customer service updates that are considered necessary to provide the service to you. Because of our commitment to present the best possible product to all our users, we track the category of services selected by our individual users as well as all information pertaining to user satisfaction. To ensure the quality of our product, we reserve the right to maintain evaluation and feedback records.</p>
<p>BUSINESS INFORMATION: In-session information is considered confidential to the GoToAssist account holder. We will not view Business Information except as necessary to appropriately support the service. (Business Information includes email addresses, names, chat logs and any other business contact information used while in session.) We will only use the Business Information provided for the purpose of anticipating, diagnosing, supporting or resolving any problems that might limit or disrupt the quality of your GoToAssist Express experience.</p>
<p>UNATTENDED SUPPORT: Unattended Support is a permission-based feature available for GoToAssist Express customers and access must be set up in advance and with the approval of the owner of the unattended machine. The person providing unattended support must provide a strong password, and all network activity is encrypted using both SSL and AES encryption, so only the approved support provider can gain access via the Unattended Support link. The responsibility for security then rests on the relationship of trust between the support provider and the customer. Because it is 100 percent permission-based feature, the customer has the ability to block or disable Unattended Support access at any time, temporarily or permanently.</p>
<p>SECURITY INFORMATION: GoToAssist's secure-communication architecture uses industry-standard secure sockets layer (SSL) and 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption. GoToAssist encrypts session data end to end and never holds unencrypted session information within its infrastructure. "In-session information" includes all screen-sharing data, keyboard/mouse control data and text chat information. This information is never exposed in unencrypted form while temporarily resident within Citrix Online communication infrastructure servers or during transmission across public or private networks.</p>
<p>Citrix Online also collects certain standard information about the end user's computer for security and identification purposes. This information may include: IP addresses, domain names, access times, cookies and other uniquely identifying information of machines that have the software downloaded and installed. This information is used for the operation of the service, to identify and protect our customers and to control unauthorized use or abuse of our services.</p>
<p>SESSION RECORDS: To maintain our quality of service and to assist in the analysis of product performance, we may also gather data on connection information, including the timing and size of all packets sent over the Internet during a session. The gathered information is used only to ensure the highest quality experience possible.</p>
<p>COOKIES: A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. We use cookies to track user traffic patterns and hold certain registration information. When you register at Citrix Online sites, we use cookies to store unique, randomly assigned user IDs that we generate for administrative purposes. These cookies enable you to enter the Citrix Online sites without having to log on each time. We do not store passwords or any Personal Information about you in the cookies.</p>
<p>We continuously improve our Web sites and utilize different Web analytic tools to help us do so. We are interested in how visitors use our Web sites, what they like and dislike, and where they have problems. The Web beacons used in connection with our Web analytics services do not share any personally identifiable information about our Web site visitors with third parties. Our tools may gather data such as what browser a person uses, what operating systems are used, and what content, products and services are reviewed when visiting or registering for services at one of our Web sites. This information is used solely to assist Citrix Online in maintaining a more effective and useful Web site for our customers.</p>
<p>Citrix Online also partners with selected marketing companies to help us track the effectiveness of our Web sites, generate visitor traffic, and manage our affiliate referral program through Commission Junction (<a href="http://www.cj.com" onclick="return popUp(this);">http://www.cj.com</a>). When a partner refers a visitor to us from any of these sites, they set a Web beacon and a cookie on our site. An ad ID and a partner ID are stored in the cookie, but no Personal Information specific to the actual visitor is stored. Citrix Online does not see the cookie; we only include the Web beacon on our page, which results in a request to the partner's servers from the customer browser. We have no control over their use of the cookie after it is placed on our site.</p>
<p>The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. You can still review the Web site if you choose to set your browser to refuse all cookies.</p>

<h3>3. With whom does Citrix Online share my GoToAssist Personal Information and Other Data?</h3>
<p>Ensuring your privacy is important to us. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to third parties.</p>
<p>Citrix Online products and services by necessity require us to provide some Personal Information to third parties. We may occasionally employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include, but are not limited to, processing credit card payments, sending postal mail and email, analyzing data and providing marketing assistance. These parties have access to Personal Information needed only to perform their functions and may not use it for any other purpose. Further, they must process the Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In the event that GoToAssist, Citrix Online or substantially all of its assets are acquired, Personal Information will be one of the transferred assets. For more information on how you will be notified in this instance, see Section 4 below.</p>
<p>Occasionally we send offers to select groups of GoToAssist customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not share your personal information with the other businesses. Except in the limited instances as stated above, we will never voluntarily share personally identifiable information with any third party without the user’s express consent or unless compelled by applicable state and federal laws. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
<p>Citrix Online does not control the practices of our affiliates. If you have questions about how affiliates use the information gathered when you link to them, please read their privacy policies.</p>
