	From time to time, Citrix Online may introduce new products and services. To the extent that these new products and services affect this policy, this policy will be updated. Please see item number 5 for more details.
	<p class="tocQ" id="needed">1. What is GoToMyPC and why is my information needed?</p>
	The Citrix® GoToMyPC® remote-access service provides the registered user with remote access to the user's registered PC(s) or Mac® computers from any Web browser. Citrix Online makes the GoToMyPC service available under a number of different subscription plans. Because GoToMyPC is Web based, it requires the use of first and last names, a password, a valid email address as a login, a billing address and a valid credit card to process payment for service. Therefore, at a minimum, we require such necessary information during the registration process. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from this site.
	<p class="padT8px"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
	<p class="tocQ" id="used">2. What information does Citrix Online gather/track and how is it used?</p>
	PERSONAL INFORMATION: Because of the nature of our product, we must collect personal information from users during the registration process, including first and last names, a valid credit card to process payment for service, an email address to be used as a login, a billing address and a password. When a user registers online for a free trial of the service, Citrix Online will take steps to validate the credit card and billing information supplied to us to ensure it is accurate. We also use this information to determine your eligibility for our one-time free trial offer. The credit card information supplied will then be used to establish your subscription with us should you decide to continue the service after the free trial has ended. Your email address may be used to send you periodic newsletters from Citrix Online and GoToMyPC. Users can opt out of promotional emails at anytime, but will still receive communications such as receipts, confirmation emails and customer service updates that are considered necessary to provide the service to you. We use the information collected to deliver services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products and services and to update our records and generally maintain your accounts with us. We do not share, sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties for unknown reasons.
	<p class="padTB8px">Because of our commitment to present the best possible product to all our users, we track the category of services selected by our individual users as well as all information pertaining to user satisfaction. To ensure the quality of our product, we reserve the right to maintain evaluation and feedback records indefinitely.</p>
	PARTNERS: In some cases we provide services or sell product lines jointly with other businesses. For these co-branded offerings in which a third party is involved in your transactions, we will sometimes share or jointly collect customer information related to those transactions with that third party. We will notify you on the co-branded registration pages at the time you create your account who is collecting the information or receiving the information, and whose privacy statement governs the information through such a co-branded offering. If you are registered with Citrix Online through a partnership and you request to opt out, we will provide your email address to the partner so that we can process your request and discontinue sending you any future marketing communications or third-party promotional information.
	<p class="padTB8px">SECURITY INFORMATION: Citrix Online also collects certain standard information about your computer for security and identification purposes. This information may include: IP addresses, domain name, access times, network addresses and the primary disk-drive serial number of machines that have the GoToMyPC software downloaded and installed. This information is used for the operation of the service, to identify and protect our customers and to control unauthorized use or abuse of our services. All information is encrypted during transmission and is stored securely within our servers.</p>
	SESSION RECORDS: To maintain our quality of service and to assist in the analysis of product performance, we may also gather data on connection information, including the timing and size of all packets sent over the Internet during a session. The gathered information is used only to ensure the highest quality experience possible at GoToMyPC.
	<p class="padTB8px">SURVEYS: In addition to required subscriber information, we may conduct surveys and ask users to volunteer demographic information to be used on an aggregate basis for internal market research, presentation to advertisers and joint research projects with outside companies involved in product development. We use such information to better focus our product and personalize the scope of services offered to each individual user. Such information will not be passed to third parties without your prior consent unless where required by applicable law.</p>
	TRAFFIC PATTERNS: We also track aggregate traffic patterns throughout our site. However, we do not correlate this information with personally identifiable data about individual users. We do track domain names, browser types and MIME type.
	<p class="padTB8px">COOKIES: A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. We use cookies to track user traffic patterns and hold certain registration information. When you register at Citrix Online sites, we use cookies to store unique, randomly assigned user IDs that we generate for administrative purposes. These cookies enable you to enter the Citrix Online sites without having to log on each time. We do not store passwords or any Personal Information about you in the cookies.</p>
	<p class="padTB8px">We continuously improve our Web sites and utilize different Web analytic tools to help us do so. We are interested in how visitors use our Web sites, what they like and dislike, and where they have problems. The Web beacons used in connection with our Web analytics services do not share any personally identifiable information about our Web site visitors with third parties. Our tools may gather data such as what browser a person uses, what operating systems are used, and what content, products and services are reviewed when visiting or registering for services at one of our Web sites. This information is used solely to assist Citrix Online in maintaining a more effective and useful Web site for our customers.</p>
	<p class="padTB8px">Citrix Online also partners with selected marketing companies to help us track the effectiveness of our Web sites, generate visitor traffic, and as part of our affiliate referral program through Commission Junction (http://www.cj.com). When a partner refers a visitor to us from any of these sites, they set a Web beacon and a cookie on our site. An ad ID and a partner ID are stored in the cookie, but no personally identifiable information specific to the actual visitor is stored. Citrix Online does not see the cookie; we only include the Web beacon on our page, which results in a request to the partner's servers from the customer browser. We have no control over their use of the cookie after it is placed on our site.</p>
	The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. You can still review the Web site if you choose to set your browser to refuse all cookies; however, you must enable cookies in order to establish an account and to download and install the GoToMyPC software.
	<p class="padT8px"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
	<p class="tocQ" id="share">3. With whom does Citrix Online share the information?</p>
	Ensuring your privacy is important to us. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to third parties.
	<p class="padTB8px">Citrix Online products and services by necessity require us to provide some of your information to third parties. To the extent such disclosure is necessary, we will notify you of the specific information disclosed. GoToMyPC employs other companies and individuals to assist us in performing certain functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments, sending postal mail and email, analyzing data and providing marketing assistance. They only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in strict accordance with this Privacy Policy. Also, in the event that GoToMyPC/Citrix Online or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets. For more information on how you will be notified in this instance, <a href="/privacy.tmpl#opt">see Section 5 below</a>.</p>
	<p class="padTB8px">Occasionally we send offers to selected groups of GoToMyPC customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give the businesses your name and address. Except in the limited instances as stated above, we will never voluntarily share personally identifiable information with any third party without the user's express consent or unless compelled by applicable state and federal laws. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
	Citrix Online does not control the practices of our affiliates. If you have questions about how affiliates use the information gathered when you link to them, please read their privacy policies.
	<p class="padT8px"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
	<p class="tocQ" id="review">4. How can I review, correct and update my personal information?</p>
	If you wish to change or review your personal information, go to your My Account page. There you can access or update the personal information and account history we have on file. You can also change your email subscription status to receive our newsletter, email marketing communications and third-party promotions administered by Citrix Online. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:gotocustomercare@care.gotomypc.com">gotocustomercare@care.gotomypc.com</a> if you need assistance in updating or reviewing your information. Citrix Online will respond to your request to review the information we have on file for you within 30 days.
	<p class="padT8px"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
	<p class="tocQ" id="opt">5. How can I opt out of Citrix Online's collection, use and distribution of my information?</p>
	To change your email subscription status to receive or to stop receiving marketing communications or third-party promotions administered by Citrix Online or to opt out of Citrix Online's collection, use and distribution of your information, go to the <a href="/en_US/unsubscribe.tmpl">Unsubscribe page</a>. Users who would like to delete their account can contact us at <a href="mailto:gotocustomercare@care.gotomypc.com">gotocustomercare@care.gotomypc.com</a> for assistance.
	<p class="padTB8px">This privacy policy is subject to change at the sole discretion of Citrix Online. If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in a different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. When we post the notice, we will also, in some cases, email a notification regarding such changes to those users who have opted to receive communications from us.</p>
	<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
	<p class="tocQ" id="protect">6. How does Citrix Online protect my information from loss, misuse or alteration?</p>
	Citrix Online uses industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of personally identifiable information, including encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).
	<p class="padTB8px">Furthermore, Citrix Online is not liable for loss of passwords due to user carelessness. If you lose control over your password, you may lose control over your personally identifiable information. If you believe your password has been compromised, we recommend that you immediately change your password. For information on how to do this, please see section 4 above (How can I review, correct and update my personal information?)</p>
	<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
	<p class="tocQ" id="do">7. What does Citrix Online do with Send a Friend a Free Trial/Guest Invite information?</p>
	We do not collect or store any personal information as part of our referral program. If you would like to send a friend or colleague information about a free trial of our product, we will provide you with an email text or link that you can send to them from your email account.
	<p class="padTB8px">If a user elects to use the Guest Invite feature, we ask the user for the friend's email address. GoToMyPC will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting the friend to visit the user's desktop for a guest session. The friend will also receive an automatic one-time follow-up email after the guest session is complete. Citrix Online does not store the mail sent, but does keep a record of who sent the email and to whom it was sent. To request the removal of this information from our database, the friend may contact Citrix Online by sending a message to <a href="mailto:privacy@citrixonline.com">privacy@citrixonline.com</a>.</p>
	<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
	<p class="tocQ" id="become">8. What does Citrix Online do with information submitted through the Become a Partner link?</p>
	Information submitted to us via the Become a Partner link is completely voluntary and enables us to provide you with information on GoToMyPC partnership opportunities. You may submit this information via our online form at <a href="/en_US/partners.tmpl">https://www.gotomypc.com/partners.tmpl</a> or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:gotopartners@citrixonline.com">gotopartners@citrixonline.com</a>. All information submissions are voluntary and will be used solely to provide information to you at your request. In keeping with our privacy policy standards, we will never voluntarily share personally identifiable information submitted to us about partnership opportunities with any third party without your express consent or unless compelled by applicable state and federal laws.
	<p class="padT8px"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
	<p class="tocQ" id="ask">9. Who can I contact if I have additional questions?</p>
	For additional inquiries about the privacy of your information, you can contact Citrix Online via email at <a href="mailto:privacy@citrixonline.com">privacy@citrixonline.com</a>, by calling +1-805-690-6400 or by writing to us via regular mail at: Citrix Online, 6500 Hollister Avenue, Goleta, California 93117.
