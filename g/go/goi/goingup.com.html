      <h2>GoingUp! Privacy Policy</h2>
      <div style="padding: 20px 30px 0px 5px;">
        <p> GoingUp! (GU!) is committed to protecting the  privacy of visitors to our website, as well as our customers and clients. GU! has established this Privacy Policy to explain what  information we collect through this website and how it is used. </p>
        <p>In this policy, "GU!" refers to GU! staff, board members,  cooperating attorneys, interns, volunteers, and consultants, all of  whom are bound by law or contract to keep information they receive as  part of their assistance to GU! confidential. </p>
        <p>GU! does not sell or rent  information under any  circumstances, and we do not share information without prior consent  except as compelled by law. (See discussion below.) </p>
        <p><strong>Information Gathered by GU!'s Site</strong><br>
          For visitors to our  website and sites using GoingUp! services, we  log standard technical  information, such as the numerical Internet protocol (IP) address of  the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your  operating system; and the Internet address of the website from which  you linked directly to our site. You use of the GU! site or partner sites indicates your consent to the gathering of this information.</p>
        <p> We do not use persistent cookies on this site unless you log into the  Account Center or use "Remember Me" or other similar functionality. We  may use session cookies from time to time. Session cookies expire when  you close your browser. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, and  use Tor if you wish to keep your IP number and other technical information anonymous. </p>
        <p> In addition, GU! collects and retains information you submit to us. It  is up to you whether to submit information to us, and how much  information to provide. If you choose to become an GU! customer or  register for the GU! Subscription Service, we ask for your name, title, email  address, city, state, postal code, country of residence, credit card number and phone  number, and we may invite you to select a password.</p>
        <p><strong>GU!'s Use of Information</strong><br>
          In general, GU! uses the information provided by you to provide you with the services you ask for, and to provide visitors with information. </p>
        <p> If you invite another person to join GU!, we will ask for that person's  name and online contact information. We use this information to contact  and, if necessary, remind that person that he or she has been invited  to join GU!. </p>
        <p> We may run surveys, contests, or similar activities through this site.  Such information will be used for the purposes for which it was  collected. </p>
        <p> We look at technical information to diagnose problems with our server and to administer the GU! site. </p>
        <p><strong>Disclosure of Your Information</strong><br>
          While GU! endeavors to  provide the highest level of protection for your information, <strong>we will not disclose personally identifiable information about you </strong>to third parties  in any circumstance without your consent; or when it is required by law, such as pursuant to  a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order. </p>
        <p> If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have  submitted, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are  prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order  to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt  to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address,  or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address. If you do not  challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn  over your information. </p>
        <p> In addition, we will independently object to requests for access to  information about users of our site that we believe to be improper. </p>
        <strong>Updating or Removing Your Information</strong><br>
        <p> You may choose to correct, update, or delete the membership information  you have submitted to us by sending an email requesting changes to  webmaster@goingup.com. Furthermore, if we inadvertently collect more  personal information than intended, we endeavor to delete the  extraneous information. However, please understand that deleted  information may continue to persist on back-up media. </p>
        <strong>Changes to Our Policies</strong><br>
        <p> GU!'s Privacy Policy may change from time to time. However, any revised  privacy policy will be consistent with GU!'s mission. If we make any  substantive changes to our policies, we will place notice in GU!ector  and post notice of changes on this page. </p>
        <p><strong>Security</strong><br>
          GU! employs industry standard security measures to protect the loss,  misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.  Information submitted through the shopping and membership processes is encrypted through a Secured Socket Layer (SSL)  connections, which protects the information in transit. </p>
        <p>Although we make good faith efforts to store information  collected by GU! in a secure operating environment, we cannot guarantee  complete security. Information collected by GU! will be maintained for  a length of time appropriate to our needs.</p>
