<h2>
            Privacy Policy
        </h2><h4>
            Our Commitment to Your Privacy
        </h4>
        <p>
            Your privacy is important to GoDairyFree.org and Fleming Marrs, Inc.. To better
            protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices
            and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
            To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on these pages and at every
            point where personally identifiable information may be requested.
        </p>
        <h4>
            The Information We Collect
        </h4>
        <p>
            This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the
            GoDairyFree.org and GoDairyFree.com
        websites . On some pages, you may be able to order products,
            make requests, and register to receive materials or make use of our private forums.
            The types of personal information collected at these pages may be any or all of
            the following:</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Name </li>
                <li>Address </li>
                <li>Phone Number</li>
                <li>Email Address </li>
                <li>IP Address (for use on private forum) </li>
                <li>Credit/Debit Card Information </li>
            </ul>
        
        <p>
            The credit and payment services we utilize to process your order have their own
            privacy statements which may be different from those found here at GoDairyFree.org
            and GoDairyFree.com. It is therefore recommended that you carefully read the privacy
            statements located on these other sites to help protect your privacy.
        </p>
        <h4>
            How We Use Your Information
        </h4>
        <p>
            We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to
            complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except
            to the extent necessary to complete that order. We use the information you provide
            about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm
            delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent
            necessary to complete that order. We use return email addresses to answer the email
            we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared
            with outside parties or collected in a database. You can register with our website
            if you would like to receive updates on our new products and services. Information
            you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out
            the registration form. We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better
            design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser
            that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number
            of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not
            disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. Finally, we
            never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online
            in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity
            to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Our Commitment to Your Data Security
        </h4>
        <p>
            To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use
            of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
            procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Our Commitment to Children's Privacy
        </h4>
        <p>
            Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important to us at GoDairyFree.org
            and GoDairyFree.com. And for that reason, we never collect or maintain information
            at our website from those we actually know are under the age of 13 .
            No part of our website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 13 . Also, if we hear
            of, are informed of, or are witness to any illegal activity with, to, or directed
            at children, we will promptly report such parties to the proper authorities for
            prosecution.
