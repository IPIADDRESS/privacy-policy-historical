</p><p><strong>GodTube, Inc.</strong> ("GodTube") recognizes that its customers, visitors,   users, and others who use www.GodTube.com or other web sites owned or operated by GodTube (the "GodTube Sites")   (collectively or individually "Users") value their privacy. This Privacy Notice   details important information regarding the use and disclosure of User   information collected on the GodTube Sites. GodTube provides this Privacy Notice   to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the   GodTube Sites.</p>
<p>This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the GodTube Terms of Use. Your use of the GodTube Sites and any   personal information you provide on the GodTube Sites remains subject to the   terms of this Privacy Notice and our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Please note that any video, image, or other content posted at the direction   of Users onto the GodTube Sites becomes published content and is not considered   personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Notice.</p>
<span class="bold_blue_large">The Information GodTube Collects</span>
<ul>
  <li><strong>User Provided Information:</strong> You provide certain personally   identifiable information (such as your name and email address) to GodTube when   choosing to participate in various activities on the GodTube Sites such as   uploading videos, posting messages in our forums or in the video comments   section, entering contests or sweepstakes, taking advantage of promotions,   responding to surveys, or subscribing to newsletters or other mailing lists. <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cookies Information:</strong> When you visit the GodTube Sites, we may send   one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric   characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. GodTube   uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains   after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on   subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following   your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and   disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to   refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some   features of the GodTube Sites may not function properly if the ability to accept   cookies is disabled. <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Log File Information:</strong> When you use the GodTube Sites, our servers   automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever   you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your   web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language,   referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names,   landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time   spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more   cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Clear GIFs Information:</strong> When you use the GodTube Sites, we may employ   "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage   patterns of our Users anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable   manner). In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to   our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. </li>
</ul>
<span class="bold_blue_large">The Way GodTube Uses Information</span>
<ul>
  <li>If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the GodTube   Sites, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide   to you the features and functionality of the GodTube Sites. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose   online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public   profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by   others. Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users   when you upload videos or send messages through the GodTube Sites and other   Users can contact you through messages and comments. Any videos that you submit   to the GodTube Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media   channels, and may be viewed by the general public. <br>
  </li>
  <li>We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable   information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or   except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the   ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without   further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying   you of major GodTube Site changes or for customer service purposes). <br>
  </li>
  <li>We use both your personally identifiable information and certain   non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data,   cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the   quality and design of the GodTube Sites and to create new features, promotions,   functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences   and trends. <br>
  </li>
  <li>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember   information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the   next time you visit the GodTube Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content   and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d)   monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.;   and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes,   and contests. </li>
</ul>
<span class="bold_blue_large">When GodTube Discloses Information</span>
<ul>
  <li>We provide personally identifiable information and   non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated   companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such   information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such   information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts   to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate   confidentiality and security measures. <br>
  </li>
  <li>We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or   email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or   marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or   feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. <br>
  </li>
  <li>We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User   usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks,   etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage   patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or   functionality on the GodTube Sites. <br>
  </li>
  <li>We may release personally identifiable information and/or   non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the   good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal   laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or   search warrant. <br>
  </li>
  <li>GodTube also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable   information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that GodTube   believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to   investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to   assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of   our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of   GodTube, our Users or others. </li>
</ul>
<span class="bold_blue_large">Your Choices</span>
<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information   through the GodTube Sites, in which case GodTube may not be able to provide   certain services to you. You may update or correct your personal profile   information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account profile page. Please note that media files   uploaded by Users to the GodTube Sites cannot be removed and remain subject to   our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as   requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you   profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the   secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.</p>
<p>Please contact GodTube with any questions or comments about this Privacy   Notice, your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out   choices using this contact form.</p>
<span class="bold_blue_large">Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</span>
<p>GodTube allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks,   to serve advertisements within the GodTube Sites. These third-party ad servers   or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the   advertisements and links that appear on the GodTube Sites. They automatically   receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies   (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of   their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.</p>
<p>GodTube does not provide any personally identifiable information to these   third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of   a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or   opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks GodTube to show an   advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience   segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of   content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may   conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.   The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the GodTube Sites,   such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally   identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.</p>
<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad   servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices   and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. GodTube's privacy   policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other   advertisers or web sites.<br>
</p>
<span class="bold_blue_large">Our Commitment To Data Security</span>
<p>GodTube uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical   safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.   We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you   transmit to GodTube and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your   transmission of information, GodTube makes commercially reasonable efforts to   ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a   guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or   destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial   safeguards.</p>
<p>If GodTube learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify   you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. GodTube   may post a notice on the GodTube Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending on   where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security   breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to   withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us   using this <a href="/contact?PHPSESSID=2227c6a130f82e5d551f666336700c93">contact form</a>.</p>
<span class="bold_blue_large">Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy</span>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that   reason, GodTube does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable   information or non-personally-identifiable information on the GodTube Sites from   persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons   under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the   GodTube Sites at any time or in any manner. If GodTube learns that personally   identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on   the GodTube Sites without verified parental consent, then GodTube will take the   appropriate steps to delete this information.</p>
<span class="bold_blue_large">Special Note to International Users</span>
<p>The GodTube Sites are hosted in the United States and are intended for and   directed to Users in the United States. If you are a User accessing the GodTube   Sites from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or   regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ   from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of   the GodTube Sites, which are governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Notice, and our Terms of Use, you are transferring your personal   information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.</p>
<span class="bold_blue_large">In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</span>
<p>In the event that GodTube is acquired by or merged with a third party entity,   we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the   information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger,   acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our   bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the   benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles   affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your   personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
<span class="bold_blue_large">Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice</span>
<p>This Privacy Notice may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by   the "effective date" below. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any   changes. In general, we only use your personal information in the manner   described in the Privacy Notice in effect when we received the personal   information you provided. Your continued use of the GodTube Sites constitutes   your agreement to this Privacy Notice and any future revisions.</p>
<p>For revisions to this Privacy Notice that may be materially less restrictive   on our use or disclosure of the personal information you have already provided   to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing such revisions   with respect to such information.</p>
