    <h2>How we process data</h2>
    <p>The GO 4 Schools system processes data provided by school/academy to allow them to:</p>
    <ul class="points">
    <li>Make data about a student available to the student and their parents/guardians to support the student's education.</li>
    <li>Make data about students available to school/academy staff to help them support students' education and to work more efficiently.</li>
    <li>Make aggregated data about students (containing no user-identifiable data) available to their Governing Bodies and/or Multi-Academy Trusts to help them support students' education.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We will also use anonymised data (containing no user-identifiable information) for:</p>
    <ul class="points">
    <li>Producing statistical analyses to help us improve our service and to support schools and academies.</li>
    <li>Producing marketing materials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The basis on which data is processed</h2>
    <ul class="points">
    <li>Hyperspheric acts as a Data Processor and the school/academy transferring data to us acts as a Data Controller.</li>
    <li>Maintained schools and academies generally have a lawful basis to process data related to students' education and to transfer it to GO 4 Schools for processing to pursue their legitimate interests, but our customers are responsible for ensuring they have the necessary measures in place before they transfer data to us.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Disclosure of your information</h2>
    <p>We will not share, sell or distribute any of the information you provide to us without your consent, except where disclosure is:</p>

    <ul class="points">
    <li>Necessary to enforce our rights, including under the GO 4 Schools Terms and Conditions.</li>
    <li>Necessary to enforce our rights under any other Terms and Conditions.</li>
    <li>Required or permitted by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Specifically:</p>
    <ul class="points">
    <li><strong>Sub-processors</strong> – Hyperspheric will not sub-contract any processing to third parties without the school/academy's written consent.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-border transfers</strong> – Hyperspheric does not transfer data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) unless the data is being accessed by a GO 4 Schools user outside the EEA.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If Hyperspheric becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>Information security</h2>
    <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorised access to or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorised access to systems where we store personal data.</p>
    
    <p>We restrict access to personal information to Hyperspheric employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
    

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>If a school ends their GO 4 Schools subscription, data held within the live system will be:</p>
    <ul class="points">
    <li>Anonymised within four weeks of cancellation.</li>
    <li>Deleted within sixteen weeks of cancellation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Backups of data containing user-identifiable information will be deleted within 6 months. </p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) outlines several rights. More information about these rights, including the conditions under which they apply, can be found <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/">here</a>.</p>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul class="points">
    <li>Ask for access to, or rectification or erasure of your data.</li>
    <li>Restrict processing (pending correction or deletion).</li>
    <li>Object to communications or direct marketing.</li>
    <li>Lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner's Office at <a href="https://ico.org.uk/concerns/">https://ico.org.uk/concerns/</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>You should address such requests to your school/academy which acts as the Data Controller.</p>

    <p>None of the data within the GO 4 Schools system is subject to the right for data portability.</p>

    <p>GO 4 Schools does not carry out any profiling or automated decision making with a "legal or similarly significant effect"</p>
