    <p>Hyperspheric Solutions Ltd ("Hyperspheric"), the company behind the GO 4 Schools product,

    This Privacy Policy applies to the GO 4 Schools product ("www.go4schools.com") and lets you 
    know how any personal information is processed and used by us. Our procedures covering 
    the storage and disclosure of your information are designed to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
    
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to <a href="/ContactUs.aspx" title="Contact us">contact us</a> through our

    <h2>Information we collect and how we use it</h2>
    <p>In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
    
    <ul class="points">
    <li>Cookies – When you visit GO 4 Schools, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, and tracking user trends.</li>
    <li>Log information – When you access GO 4 Schools, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</li>
    <li>User communications – When you send email or other communications related to GO 4 Schools, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.</li>
    <li>Links – GO 4 Schools may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our product.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This information is used for the provision of the GO 4 Schools service, plus:</p>
    <ul class="points">
        <li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services.</li>
        <li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network.</li>
        <li>Protecting the rights or property of Hyperspheric Solutions Ltd or our users.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In order to log on to GO 4 Schools you must have supplied one or more schools with your email address or been supplied with an email address by a school. We will use such email addresses solely to allow you to log on to GO 4 Schools and to communicate with you on the request of the appropriate school.</p>

    <h3>Choices for personal information</h3>
    <p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, GO 4 Schools may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.</p>

    <h2>Information sharing</h2>
    <p>Hyperspheric only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Hyperspheric 
    only if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is 
    reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental 
    request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, 
    (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm 
    to the rights, property or safety of Hyperspheric, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
    <p>If Hyperspheric becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, 
    we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice 
    before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
    <p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the 
    number of users who are using GO 4 Schools. Such information does not identify you individually.</p>
    <p>Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data. </p>
    
    <h2>Information security</h2>
    <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized 
    alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, 
    storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard 
    against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.</p>
    <p>We restrict access to personal information to Hyperspheric employees, contractors and agents who 
    need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals 
    are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and 
    criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>

    <h2>Data integrity</h2>
    <p>Hyperspheric processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in 
    accordance with this Privacy Policy. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to 
    ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our 
    services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy.</p>
    
    <h2>Accessing and updating personal information</h2>
    <p>GO 4 Schools only holds data about you which has been provided by schools. If this data is incorrect, 
    you should contact the school. Changes that the school makes to data held about you will then be 
    automatically reflected within GO 4 Schools.</p>
    
    <h2>Enforcement</h2>
    <p>Hyperspheric regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. 
    Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or 
    Hyperspheric's treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or

    the complainant regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory

    of personal data that cannot be resolved between Hyperspheric and an individual.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights 
    under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. 
    Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, 
    we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy 
    Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its 
    effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.</p>
