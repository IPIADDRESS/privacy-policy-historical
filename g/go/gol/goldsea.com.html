e at GoldSea firmly believe that web sites commit gross violations of privacy when they surreptitiously track, gather, use and sell data about visitors, their habits and internet-access paths without their express written prior consent.  

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Consumers should be informed that the surreptitious use of cookies and other commercial viruses to match visitor habits with their net addresses subjects visitors to the possibility of becoming targets of unscrupulous database merchants and direct marketers, and even to having their internet useage revealed through subpoenas and other legal proccesses.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For that reason GoldSea has never collected, maintained, sold, distributed or otherwise used visitor data gathered without their express knowledge.

The only absolutely sure way to protect consumers against abuse is not to collect such data in the first place.  We have only collected information submitted voluntarily through survey and order forms.  We keep such data password protected against unauthorized access soley for internal use.   We have never sold or otherwise disseminated personal data and are firmly committed against doing so.
