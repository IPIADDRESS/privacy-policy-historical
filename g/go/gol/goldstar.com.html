<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This privacy policy is effective on November 8th, 2007.</p>
<p>Goldstar Events, Inc. is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an
independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and
confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.
This privacy statement covers the site www.goldstar.com. Because this Web
site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to
disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for
compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
<p>At Goldstar, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We
do not share any personal information with third parties in ways that are not
disclosed in this privacy statement.</p>
<p>Visitors to the goldstar.com Web site ("Site") can access many
informational areas of the Site, such as browsing information about our company,
policies, and help content. While visitors can browse these portions of the Site
without sharing personal information, visitors must become registered members in
order to enjoy the full benefits and features of what Goldstar has to offer,
including purchasing event admissions. We use the information we collect about
our members to create a more personalized online experience. Users must be 18
years of age or older to purchase tickets on Goldstar.</p>
<p>By using our Site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your
information as described below. This Privacy Policy may change from time to
time, so please check back periodically. If we make material changes to this
policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home
page.</p>
<h3>Business Transitions</h3>
<p>In the event Goldstar goes through a business transition, such as
a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its
assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the
assets transferred.  You will be notified via email and/or prominent notice
on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your
personal information.</p>
<h3>Your IP Address</h3>
<p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer
the Site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad
demographic information about our members. Your IP address is recorded when
joining and making purchases. This enables us to detect and prevent fraudulent
activity.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Cookies are small amounts of data stored on your computer. The Site uses cookies
to "remember" you once you've logged in so that you are not repeatedly
asked to log in. This cookie is associated with your account and your personal
information. The Site also uses cookies to record referral information.</p>
<p>Additionally, various third parties who refer potential new members to the Site
may set cookies on their own Web site before linking to us. Said third parties
may also read cookies on the Site to track purchase and join referrals that said
parties are responsible for.</p>
<h3>Web Beacons and Unique URLs</h3>
<p>We use clear GIFs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails are
opened by recipients.  Additionally, links in emails may be unique to let us
know which emails are clicked on. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness
of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>
<h3>Information We Request Directly From You</h3>
<p>Our Site's registration forms, order forms, contact us forms, surveys and
contests may require you to give us contact information (such as your name and
email address), unique identifiers (such as a username and password), and
demographic information (such as your ZIP code or age). Our order forms require
financial information (such as your account or credit card numbers and billing
address) as well. If tickets are mailed, we require a shipping address.</p>
<p>In the case your purchase is a gift for another person, we may require and
collect third party personal information. Specifically, we may provide the
gift recipient's name and/or phone number to the venue or event promoter. If
the tickets are mailed, we require the recipient's shipping address. This
information will only be used to complete fulfillment of the gift.</p>
<h3>How We Use Contact Information</h3>
<p>Your contact information is used to contact you when necessary in connection
with transactions entered into by you on our Site. A limited amount of personal
information is provided to the venues and selected promoters of concerts and
events for which you purchase admission.  Specifically, we disclose your name
or the name of the gift recipients. We may also disclose other personal
information specifically related to your purchase such as the need for
handicap seating. In rare instances, we may also need to disclose your phone
number to the venue or event promoter because of last minute changes that will
affect your purchase.  Examples of this might include cancellations and
postponements on the day of the event. If tickets will be delivered by mail,
your shipping address may also be disclosed. Your credit card information,
email address and/or demographic information is specifically not disclosed.
Your billing address will also not be disclosed unless it is also the
shipping address. Venues and/or promoters are specifically prohibited from
using personal information provided to them for any purpose other than
fulfilling your purchase or admission.</p>
<p>We also use customer contact information we collect in order to send you
information and offers from our company. We carefully select the information
we send and make sure that it offers real value to you, such as discounts,
exclusive offers or special event information. Users may opt-out of all
special event notifications by editing their
<a href="/account/index.pl">account preferences</a>. Users are
required to receive our weekly event newsletter as part of their membership.
Users not wanting to receive our weekly event newsletter may terminate their
membership by visiting our  <a href="/unsubscribe.pl">unsubscribe</a>
page.</p>
<h3>How We Use Feedback and Ratings</h3>
<p>If you buy tickets to an event on our site, we may solicit you by email for
your feedback on the experience.  Feedback can include ratings, reviews,
names, taglines and/or photos.  If you choose to give us feedback and make
your feedback public, it will be displayed on the Goldstar website
in association with the specific event or venue, and shared with the venue or
producers of the event. Goldstar may also use all or part of your review
as part of the "Roar of the Crowd"
email along with your member profile name.  If you choose not to make your
feedback public, it will only be made available anonymously to the venue or
producers of the event, but not to the public at large or to other venues and
producers. In the event that you unsubscribe or discontinue your Goldstar
membership, all feedback and your member profile will be considered not public
and removed from the public site.</p>
<p>We strongly discourage you from disclosing any personal information, such as
email addresses, phone numbers or credit card information, in your feedback,
especially if you've chosen to make it public.  If you disclose any personal
information in your feedback that you have chosen to make public, anyone will
be able to see this information. If you disclose any personal
information in your feedback that you have chosen not to make public, such as
your email address, the venue and their staff will have access to this
information but are prohibited from using it to send you unsolicited messages.
From time to time, Goldstar or the venue may want to reprint or reuse
feedback as a testimonial or quote outside of the Goldstar website. For
example, a venue may want to include it in marketing materials. When such
occasions arise, we will contact you to obtain consent.</p>
<h3>How We Use Financial Information</h3>
<p>Financial information that is collected is used to check your qualifications
and bill you for products and services. Unique identifiers such as your date
of birth are collected from you to verify your identity. We will not share
financial or unique identifier information with third parties unless it is
necessary to process your transaction (i.e. processing your credit card).</p>
<h3>How We Use Demographic Information</h3>
<p>We use this information to tailor our Site to the interests of our users. This
information is shared with third parties only on an aggregate basis so that they
can tailor our content to the appropriate audience.</p>
<h3>Other Sites/Third Party Vendors and Their Privacy Policies</h3>
<p>This Site may contain links to other Web sites. Goldstar is not
responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites or for
the privacy policies and practices of other third parties.</p>
<h3>Our Security Precautions</h3>
<p>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and
alteration of the information under our control. Our secure server software (SSL)
is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure
commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including
credit card number, name and address, so that it cannot be read as the information
travels over the Internet.</p>
<h3>How You Can Update Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>This Site gives you the opportunity to change and/or modify your account
information you have provided to us through our <a href="/account/index.pl">account
preferences</a> page. If you have created a Public Member Profile, you can change
and/or modify the profile information you have provided to us by editing feedback
in your <a href="/account/history.pl">purchase history</a>.
Changing or deleting your any of this data will change or delete the
data only in our member database, but will not change or delete information
which we have collected as part of a particular ticket purchase in our
transactions database. Users may change or update information related to
transactions by <a href="/help/contact_us.pl">contacting us</a> or
replying to their confirmation email.</p>
<h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>
<p><i>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as
required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our
rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process
served on our Web site.</i></p>
