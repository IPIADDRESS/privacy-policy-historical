<p>This privacy policy is effective on January 31st, 2009.</p>
<p>Goldstar Events, Inc. is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site www.goldstar.com. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
<p>At Goldstar, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We do not share any personal information with third parties in ways that are not disclosed in this privacy statement.</p>
<p>Visitors to the goldstar.com Web site ("Site") can access many informational areas of the Site, such as browsing information about our company, policies, and help content. While visitors can browse these portions of the Site without sharing personal information, visitors must become registered members in order to enjoy the full benefits and features of what Goldstar has to offer, including purchasing event admissions. We use the information we collect about our members to create a more personalized online experience. Users must be 18 years of age or older to purchase tickets on Goldstar.</p>
<p>By using our Site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information as described below. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>

<h3 class="bottom-border">Business Transitions</h3>
<p>In the event Goldstar goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>

<h3 class="bottom-border">Your IP Address</h3>
<p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about our members. Your IP address is recorded when joining and making purchases. This enables us to detect and prevent fraudulent activity.</p>

<h3 class="bottom-border">Cookies</h3>
<p>Cookies are small amounts of data stored on your computer. The Site uses cookies to "remember" you once you've logged in so that you are not repeatedly asked to log in. This cookie is associated with your account and your personal information. The Site also uses cookies to record referral information.</p>
<p>Additionally, various third parties who refer potential new members to the Site may set cookies on their own Web site before linking to us. Said third parties may also read cookies on the Site to track purchase and join referrals that said parties are responsible for.</p>

<h3 class="bottom-border">Web Beacons and Unique URLs</h3>
<p>We use clear GIFs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails are opened by recipients. Additionally, links in emails may be unique to let us know which emails are clicked on. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>

<h3 class="bottom-border">Information We Request Directly From You</h3>
<p>Our Site's registration forms, order forms, contact us forms, surveys and contests may require you to give us contact information (such as your name and email address), unique identifiers (such as a username and password), and demographic information (such as your ZIP code or age). Our order forms require financial information (such as your account or credit card numbers and billing address) as well. If tickets are mailed, we require a shipping address.</p>
<p>In the case your purchase is a gift for another person, we may require and collect third party personal information. Specifically, we may provide the gift recipient's name and/or phone number to the venue or event promoter. If the tickets are mailed, we require the recipient's shipping address. This information will only be used to complete fulfillment of the gift.</p>

<h3 class="bottom-border">How We Use Contact Information</h3>
<p>Your contact information is used to contact you when necessary in connection with transactions entered into by you on our Site. A limited amount of personal information is provided to the venues, suppliers, promoters and/or their affiliated agents of the events for which you purchase admission. Specifically, we disclose your name or the name of the gift recipients. We may also disclose other personal information specifically related to your purchase such as the need for handicap seating. In rare instances, we may also need to disclose your phone number to the venue or event promoter because of last minute changes that will affect your purchase. Examples of this might include cancellations and postponements on the day of the event. If tickets will be delivered by mail, your shipping address may also be disclosed. Your credit card information and/or demographic information is specifically not disclosed. Your billing address will also not be disclosed unless it is also the shipping address. For some purchases, we may require additional permission from you to disclose other personal information such as your email address. A notice of what personal information and how it will be used will appear during the checkout process. Venues, suppliers, promoters and/or their affiliated agents of the events are specifically prohibited from using personal information provided to them for any purpose other than fulfilling your purchase or admission, unless you specifically opt-in and authorize other uses.</p>
<p>We also use customer contact information we collect in order to send you information and offers from our company. We carefully select the information we send and make sure that it offers real value to you, such as discounts, exclusive offers or special event information. Users may opt-out of all special event notifications by editing their <a href="/subscriptions">email subscriptions</a>.</p>

<h3 class="bottom-border">How We Use Feedback and Ratings</h3>
<p>If you buy tickets to an event on our site, we may solicit you by email for your feedback on the experience. Feedback can include ratings, reviews, names, taglines and/or photos. If you choose to give us feedback and make your feedback public, it will be displayed on the Goldstar website in association with the specific event or venue, and shared with the venue or producers of the event. Goldstar may also use all or part of your review as part of the "Roar of the Crowd" email along with your member profile name. If you choose not to make your feedback public, it will only be made available anonymously to the venue or producers of the event, but not to the public at large or to other venues and producers. In the event that you unsubscribe or discontinue your Goldstar membership, all feedback and your member profile will be considered not public and removed from the public site.</p>
<p>We strongly discourage you from disclosing any personal information, such as email addresses, phone numbers or credit card information, in your feedback, especially if you've chosen to make it public. If you disclose any personal information in your feedback that you have chosen to make public, anyone will be able to see this information. If you disclose any personal information in your feedback that you have chosen not to make public, such as your email address, the venue and their staff will have access to this information but are prohibited from using it to send you unsolicited messages. From time to time, Goldstar or the venue may want to reprint or reuse feedback as a testimonial or quote outside of the Goldstar website. For example, a venue may want to include it in marketing materials. When such occasions arise, we will contact you to obtain consent.</p>

<h3 class="bottom-border">How We Use Financial Information</h3>
<p>Financial information that is collected is used to check your qualifications and bill you for products and services. Unique identifiers such as your date of birth are collected from you to verify your identity. We will not share financial or unique identifier information with third parties unless it is necessary to process your transaction (i.e. processing your credit card).</p>

<h3 class="bottom-border">How We Use Demographic Information</h3>
<p>We use this information to tailor our Site to the interests of our users. This information is shared with third parties only on an aggregate basis so that they can tailor our content to the appropriate audience.</p>

<h3 class="bottom-border">Other Sites/Third Party Vendors and Their Privacy Policies</h3>
<p>This Site may contain links to other Web sites. Goldstar is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites or for the privacy policies and practices of other third parties.</p>

<h3 class="bottom-border">Our Security Precautions</h3>
<p>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our secure server software (SSL) is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.</p>

<h3 class="bottom-border">How You Can Update Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>This Site gives you the opportunity to change and/or modify your account information you have provided to us through our <a href="/account">edit account</a> page. If you have created a Public Member Profile, you can change and/or modify the profile information you have provided to us by editing feedback in your <a href="/my_profile">profile</a>. Changing or deleting your any of this data will change or delete the data only in our member database, but will not change or delete information which we have collected as part of a particular ticket purchase in our transactions database. Users may change or update information related to transactions by <a href="/help/contact_us">contacting us</a> or replying to their confirmation email.</p>

<h3 class="bottom-border">Legal Disclaimer</h3>
<p><em>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</em></p>
