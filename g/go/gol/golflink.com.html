            <strong>Effective Date: May 13, 2008</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your privacy is important to
            GolfLink
            (“GolfLink”, “we” or “us”). This Privacy
            and Information Security Policy (“the Policy”) discusses the personally
            identifying information (“PII”) that we collect about you when you use
            our website <a href="/">http://www.golflink.com</a> (“the Site”) and
            the other services we provide on or through the Site (together with the Site, the
            “Service”). This Policy is part of and incorporated into the
            GolfLink
            <a href="/terms.aspx">Terms of Use</a> (collectively, the “Terms”).
        </p>
        <p>
            Policy highlights:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet2 ml mt">
            <li>We will not collect PII about you through the Service unless you disclose such information
                to us; </li>
            <li>We will not knowingly disclose PII about you that we collect through the Service
                to third parties, except under the limited circumstances described in this Policy;
                and </li>
            <li>We will take reasonable steps to protect the security of the PII we collect from
                you through the Service. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb">
            These Policy highlights are qualified by full reference to the terms and conditions
            described below.

        <h4>
            BY PROVIDING PII OR OTHER INFORMATION TO US OR BY USING OUR SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO

                <h4>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">INFORMATION YOU GIVE US</span>.</h4>

                    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Types of Information
                        GolfLink
                        Collects</span>. We collect any information you enter on the Service or give us
                        in any other way (such as through an email, survey, or letter). The information
                        that we collect varies depending upon how you use our Service. Our account registration
                        process requires that you provide us with your user name, birthday and email address,
                        and that you create and provide us with a password. We may also request other information,
                        such as but not limited to, your actual first and last name, gender, and zip code.
                        You may access and update certain of your personal information or account settings
                        by accessing “My Account” or “My Profile” or a similar link
                        on the Site. </li>
                    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information in Public Areas of the Site</span>.
                        Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily provide information in public
                        areas of the Service, such as the user profile pages or forums, that information
                        can be viewed and possibly used by others. We therefore advise visitors not to disclose
                        contact information, including phone number, email address, street address or instant
                        messenger address (within these public areas) that they do not wish to share. We
                        are not responsible for PII you choose to submit in these public areas. Also, we
                        may highlight content you post to the public areas of the Service such as reviews
                        or comments, such as by featuring your content on the Site's home page. </li>
                    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Minors</span>. We do not knowingly collect
                        or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow
                        such persons to register. If you are under 13, do not attempt to register for our
                        Site or send any information about yourself to us. We recommend that prospective
                        users between the ages of 13 and 17 ask their parents or other legal guardians for
                        permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.

                <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies</span>. Like many websites, we
                        use “cookies.” Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer
                        to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to
                        recognize your browser. We use persistent, identifying cookies to remember your
                        information and to link your activities to you. While you can take steps to warn
                        off, block or disable cookies, if you do, the Service may not function and appear
                        as we have designed it. Nonetheless, if you want to take these steps, you can do
                        so by following the instructions associated with your browser. Our cookies do not
                        collect PII that you provide to us during the registration process, but they do
                        collect other information such as the following:
                        <ol style="list-style: lower-roman;">
                            <li>the domain name and host from which you access the Internet and the Internet address

                            <li>the date and time you access the Site and pages you visit; </li>
                            <li>your computer's IP address and information about its operating system, platform
                                and the Web browser type and version you use; </li>
                            <li>demographic and other non-personally identifiable profile information about you;
                                and </li>
                            <li>information to combat fraud or misuse. </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pixel Tags</span>. In our email to you,
                        we use “pixel tags” to determine if your email software or service can
                        display html-formatted email (this helps us optimize the size of our email messages
                        and conserve bandwith). </li>
                    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Collection of Information by Third Parties</span>.
                        Our Site may include third-party advertising, links to other websites, and other
                        content from third party businesses. The content posted by these parties will be
                        reasonably identifiable as coming from a third party. We do not provide any PII
                        to these advertisers, third-party websites, or other businesses, although on occasion
                        we may mutually share non-personally identifiable (e.g., demographic) information
                        to facilitate delivery of relevant advertisements. These third-party websites, businesses,
                        and advertisers, or advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use
                        technology to deliver (or “serve”) the advertisements that appear on
                        our Site directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when
                        this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as
                        action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness
                        of their ads and to personalize or optimize advertising content. We do not have
                        access to or control over cookies or other technologies that they may use, and the
                        information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites or businesses
                        are not covered by this Policy but are covered by their respective privacy politices.
                        Some, but not all, third party advertising companies provide a mechanism to opt-out
                        of their technology. For more information and an identification of advertisers that
                        provide an opt-out mechanism, please click the following: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.

                        From time to time, we may host a promotion, sweepstake, or contest on the Service.
                        You may be asked to provide personal information or permit the transfer to a third
                        party of your personal information in connection with such promotion, sweepstake
                        or contest. It will be disclosed at the point of collection or transfer who is collecting
                        or transferring the information and whose privacy statement applies, and it will
                        be your choice whether or not you wish to permit such transfer or collection of

                <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advertisers and Others</span>. We share
                        non-personally identifiable information with advertisers, service providers, and
                        other persons with whom we conduct business. Similarly, these advertisers, service
                        providers, and other persons may share with us non-PII about you that they have
                        independently gathered or acquired. </li>

                        you on our behalf. Examples include providing marketing assistance, providing customer
                        service, sending
                        GolfLink
                        emails to you, removing repetitive information from customer lists, and analyzing
                        data. These third parties may have access to your PII for use solely in connection
                        with these authorized business activities. </li>
                    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Transfer</span>. As we develop
                        our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets, or engage in acquisitions,
                        mergers, restructurings, changes of control, or similar transactions. In such transactions,
                        customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets, and your
                        PII may be subject to such a transfer. Also, in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy,
                        customer information may be transferred to a bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession
                        and then to a subsequent purchaser. </li>
