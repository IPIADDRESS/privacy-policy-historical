<h1>GoldBamboo Privacy Policy</h1>
August 5, 2004
<h2>General</h2>
<p>GoldBamboo recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of information we may collect from our on-line visitors. To this end, we are committed to using our best efforts to respect the privacy of our on-line visitors.

With the information we can learn through this technology, we hope to improve our sites. </p>
