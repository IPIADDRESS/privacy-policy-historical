	<h3>How is the information collected</h3> 
	<p id="list_leader">
		We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Site, including but not limited to those described below: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<h3>Registration</h3>

			You may be asked first to complete a registration form and provide personally identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Site may choose to offer, including, but not limited to, Newsletters, Contests, Forums, Fantasy or other subscription based services.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Newsletters and Site Emails</h3>
			We may offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Site, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our business partners and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Site.

		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Contests or Sweepstakes</h3>
			We may operate contests and sweepstakes through the Site, which may require registration.

Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Site, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.
