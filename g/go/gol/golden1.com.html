	<b>Privacy Policy and Notice for The Golden 1 Credit Union and Golden 1 Financial Services, Inc.<br>Effective January 1, 2002</b>
	<br><br>
	The Golden 1 Credit Union (Golden 1) and its
affiliate, Golden 1 Financial Services (G1FS), are
committed to providing you with financial products
and services to meet your needs and to help you
reach your financial goals. Protecting the privacy
and security of your personal information and
ensuring the accuracy of such information is one of
our top priorities. Neither Golden 1 nor G1FS sell
any of your personal information to nonaffiliated
third parties, although we do disclose that
information, as provided below. While either
Golden 1 or G1FS may offer products or services
on behalf of outside companies, Golden 1 or G1FS
controls the information used to make those offers.
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy describes how Golden 1 and
G1FS (its affiliate) collect and use your personal
information and how we maintain the confidentiality
and accuracy of such information. This policy is
provided pursuant to Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the Federal Privacy Act).

	<br><br>
	<b>Information That We Collect About You</b>
	<br><br>
	We collect and maintain your information to serve
you and administer your business relationship with
Golden 1 and G1FS. Specifically, we collect
nonpublic personal information about you from
the following sources:

	<ul>
	<li>Information we receive from you on
applications or other forms, including
information such as social security numbers,
addresses, e-mail addresses, income, assets and
debt that you provide to us verbally,
electronically or in writing on applications or
forms.

	</li><li>Information we receive from a consumer
reporting agency, including information we
receive from an outside company, such as a
credit bureau, providing your credit history,
credit score or employment verification.

	</li><li>Information created as a result of your being a
customer of G1FS or your being a Golden 1
member or nonmember joint owner on a
deposit or loan account, such as account
numbers, PIN codes, and passwords.

	</li><li>Information about your transactions with us,
our affiliates, or others, including
information about your transactions or
experiences, such as insurance contracts issued
to you, brokerage accounts or relationships you
have, or loan or deposit balance histories.
  
	</li><li>Information received from other sources to
verify the information that you provide on an
application form. This may be obtained from
your current or past employers, or from other
institutions where you have conducted financial
transactions in the past.

	</li></ul>
	<b>Information Use and Disclosure Within Golden 1 and Golden 1 Financial Services</b>
	<br><br>
	We may disclose all of the information that we
collect, as described above, within Golden 1 or
G1FS for a variety of reasons, including the
following:

	<br><br>
	<ul>
	<li>To protect the security of your account or
business relationship. For example, we use
your personal information for identification
purposes, to prevent unauthorized persons from
accessing your accounts or records with us.

	</li><li>To conduct our business in a safe and sound
manner. For example, we use information
gathered in loan applications to ensure that we
underwrite loans in a prudent manner
consistent with the requirements of credit union
regulations.

	</li><li>To satisfy legal requirements. For example, we
use your social security number for federal
income tax reporting purposes.

	</li><li>To help us determine which products and
services may best serve your needs. Services
might be offered by Golden 1 or G1FS, but
your nonpublic personal information will
always remain in the control of Golden 1 or
G1FS making the offer or extending the service
and will not be shared except as permitted by
law.
 
	</li></ul>
	For example, G1FS offers uninsured investment
products through a joint marketing arrangement
administered by a provider of securities and broker
dealer services. <em>As an added service to our members
those products will be offered through a variety of
delivery channels.</em>

	<br><br>
	<b>Information Use and Disclosure With Nonaffiliated Third Parties <em>or Affiliates</em></b>
	<br><br>
	When it comes to Golden 1 or G1FS sharing its
information with an outside party, we do so only as
permitted or required by law and for specific
purposes to provide you products and services that
you've requested or already have with us. We may
disclose all of the information that we collect, as
described above. We share this information as
needed to provide those products and services and to
provide a good member experience. We may
disclose nonpublic personal information about
you to nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by
law to the following types of third parties:

	<br><br>
	<ul>
	<li>Financial service providers, such as companies
that service your loan, provide you an
insurance or securities product or relationship,
mortgage insurers or payment processing
companies, mortgage bankers, securities
brokers-dealers, and insurance agents.

	</li><li>Non-financial companies, such as companies
that perform services on our behalf, for
example check printers, data processing
companies, companies that prepare and mail
account statements or notices and companies
that help us market our own products and
services to you.

	</li><li>Others, such as independent contractors,
including technical system consultants who
program our software to help us administer our
products or market our own products to you.

	</li></ul>
	<b>Information Disclosed to Outside Parties Who are Service Providers and Financial Institutions With Whom We Have Joint Marketing Agreements</b>
	<br><br>
	We may disclose all of the information we collect
from members, as described above, to companies
that perform marketing services on our behalf or
to other financial institutions with whom we have
joint marketing agreements. For example,
through a joint marketing arrangement, G1FS
offers brokerage and securities services from
another financial provider.
<br><br>
<strong>Information Disclosed to Outside Parties in Other Situations</strong>
	<br><br>
	Either Golden 1 or G1FS might also disclose its
own member/customer information to government
agencies, consumer reporting agencies, and other
outside parties as permitted or required by the
Federal Privacy Act and other applicable laws.
These disclosures are made for specific, limited
purposes, for instance:

	<br><br>
	<ul>
	<li>To verify individuals' identities (reducing fraud
and identity theft).

	</li><li>To meet member/customer service expectations
(connecting to ATM networks for ATM card
access, processing an application for insurance).

	</li><li>To verify information for prompt credit
approvals (meeting members' immediate
financial needs).

	</li><li>To make certain information a matter of public
record (recording mortgages to let prospective
buyers, title insurers, and others know about
property liens).

	</li><li>To comply as required with subpoenas, court
orders, and legal reporting requirements, such
as interest reporting to the Internal Revenue
Service.

	</li><li>To relate our experience with you to credit
reporting agencies and similar organizations,
such as ChexSystems.

	</li><li>To comply with your written consent, including
  when you give someone power of attorney or
  other authorization to act on your behalf.

	</li><li>To act as an agent or broker of insurance, or
completing some other routine business
transaction such as selling traveler's checks.

	</li><li>To protect your accounts or business records
against fraud and unauthorized transactions, to
resolve member/customer disputes, and, as
necessary, to our regulators, attorneys,
accountants and auditors.

	</li></ul>
	In no event will we share any account number or
any access code to any of your Golden 1 or G1FS
accounts or business records with anyone, except as
permitted by law.

	<br><br>
	<b>Disclosure of Information About Former Members</b>
	<br><br>
	It is generally unnecessary for us to disclose
information about former members or customers of
Golden 1 or G1FS to others that have a relationship
with us. However, to the extent we do disclose
information, we will adhere to the same policies as
described elsewhere in this notice.

	<br><br>
	<b>How We Protect Your Information</b>
	<br><br>
	We restrict access to nonpublic personal information
about you to those employees who need to know
that information to provide products or services to
you. Our employees are trained in the importance of
maintaining confidentiality and member/customer
privacy. We maintain physical, electronic, and
procedural safeguards that comply with federal
regulations to guard our nonpublic personal
information.
