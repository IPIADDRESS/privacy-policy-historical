                  <p><b>Information Collection and Use </b><br>
                    Gold Coast Professional Schools,inc. is the sole owner of 
                    the information collected on this site. We will not sell, 
                    share, or rent this information to others in ways different 
                    from what is disclosed in this statement. Gold Coast Professional 
                    Schools collects information from our users at several different 
                    points on our website.</p>
                  <p><b>Registration </b><br>
                    In order to use this website, a user must first complete the 
                    registration form. During registration a user is required 
                    to give their contact information (such as name and email 
                    address). This information is used to contact the user about 
                    the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. 
                    It is optional for the user to provide demographic information 
                    (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers 
                    (such as social security number), but encouraged so we can 
                    provide a more personalized experience on our site. </p>
                  <p><br>
                    <b>Order</b> <br>
                    We request information from the user on our order form. Here 
                    a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping 
                    address) and financial information (like credit card number, 
                    expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes 
                    and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing 
                    an order, this contact information is used to get in touch 
                    with the user.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    <b>Cookies</b><br>
                    A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive 
                    containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is 
                    in no way linked to any personally identifiable information 
                    while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the 
                    cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie 
                    on our site, the user would not have to log in a password 
                    more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If 
                    a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The 
                    only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in 
                    some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be 
                    able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, Contests or 
                    monthly Drawings that take place. Cookies can also enable 
                    us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance 
                    the experience on our site. Some of our business partners 
                    use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, 
                    we have no access to or control over these cookies. Gold Coast 
                    currently does not use cookies.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    <b>Log Files </b><br>
                    We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, 
                    track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information 
                    for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally 
                    identifiable information. </p>
                  <p><br>
                    <b>Sharing </b><br>
                    We will share aggregated demographic information with our 
                    partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal 
                    information that can identify any individual person. We use 
                    an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card 
                    processing company to bill users for goods and services. These 
                    companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable 
                    information for any secondary purposes. We partner with another 
                    party to provide specific services. When the user signs up 
                    for these services, we will share names, or other contact 
                    information that is necessary for the third party to provide 
                    these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally 
                    identifiable information except for the purpose of providing 
                    these services. </p>

                    Newsletter</b><br>
                    If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for

                    Surveys &amp; Contests </b><br>
                    From time-to-time our site requests information from users 
                    via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or 
                    contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has 
                    a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information 
                    requested may include contact information (such as name and 
                    shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip 
                    code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify 
                    the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used 
                    for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction 
                    of this site.</p>

                    <b>Tell-A-Friend</b><br>
                    If a user elects to use our referral service for informing 
                    a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name 
                    and email address. Gold Coast Professional Schools will automatically 
                    send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the 
                    site. Gold Coast Professional Schools stores this information 
                    for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend 
                    may contact Gold Coast Professional Schools at remove@goldcoastschoolsinc.com 
                    to request the removal of this information from their database.

                    <b>Security</b> <br>
                    This website takes every precaution to protect our users' 
                    information. When users submit sensitive information via the 
                    website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 
                    All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information 
                    mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees 
                    who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, 
                    our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are 
                    granted access to personally identifiable information. Our 
                    employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they 
                    leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their 
                    password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, 
                    ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy 
                    practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies 
                    are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about 
                    the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to 
                    ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the 
                    servers that we store personally identifiable information 
                    on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. 
                    If you have any questions about the security at our website, 
                    you can send an email to <a href="mailto:security@goldcoastschools.com%20">security@goldcoastschools.com 
                    </a></p>

                    Supplementation of Information</b><br>
                    In order for this website to properly fulfill its obligation 
                    to our customers, it is necessary for us to supplement the 
                    information we receive with information from 3rd party sources. 
                    For example, to determine if our customers qualify for one 
                    of our credit cards, we use their name and social security 
                    number to request a credit report. Once we determine a user's 
                    credit-worthiness, this document is destroyed. </p>
                  <p><br>
                    <b>Special Offers </b><br>
                    We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password 
                    and username. Established members will occasionally receive 
                    information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. 
                    Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the 
                    option to not receive these types of communications. Please 
                    see our choice and opt-out below. </p>
                  <p><br>
                    <b>Site and Service Updates </b><br>
                    We also send the user site and service announcement updates. 
                    Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, 
                    which contain important information about the service. We 
                    communicate with the user to provide requested services and 
                    in regards to issues relating to their account via email or 
                    phone. </p>
                  <p><br>
                    <b>Correction/Updating Personal Information</b><br>
                    If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such 
                    as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, 
                    we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove 
                    that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually 
                    be done at the member information page or by emailing our 
                    Customer Support. [Some sites may also provide telephone or 
                    postal mail options for updating or correcting personal information]. 
                  </p>
                  <p><br>
                    <b>Choice/Opt-out </b><br>
                    Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having 
                    their information used for purposes not directly related to 
                    our site at the point where we ask for the information. For 
                    example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users 
                    who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, 
                    can keep their email address off of our lists. Users who no 
                    longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials 
                    from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications 
                    by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email 
                    or email us at <a href="mailto:remove@goldcoastschools.com">remove@goldcoastschools.com</a> 
                    sites are able to offer opt-out mechanisms on member information 
                    pages and also supply a telephone or postal option as a way 
                    to opt-out.] Users of our site are always notified when their 
                    information is being collected by any outside parties. We 
                    do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether 
                    they should proceed with services that require an outside 
                    party, or not. </p>
                  <p><br>
                    <b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
                    If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those 
                    changes on our Home page link so our users are always aware 
                    of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, 
                    if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally 
                    identifiable information in a manner different from that stated 
                    at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way 
                    of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not 
                    we use their information in this different manner. We will 
                    use information in accordance with the privacy policy under 
                    which the information was collected. </p>
