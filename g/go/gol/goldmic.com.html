              <br>
						Goldmic only collects personally identifiable information (such as name, email address, mailing address, telephone number) about You when You specifically provide this information on a voluntary basis.

						You should be very cautious when You voluntarily disclose personal information (for example, name or email address) on bulletin boards, in chat areas, or the upload areas of our Site. That information, along with any other information You may disclose in your posting, can be collected, correlated, and used by third parties, and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Goldmic and are not subject to this Privacy Policy.<br>

We do this in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of our website and to create tailored marketing offerings.

              You should be aware that non-personally identifiable information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of Goldmic's web servers or through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small text files a website can use to recognize repeat users. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside of the website that he or she is visiting. Goldmic uses cookies to recognize visitors and more quickly provide personalized content or grant You unimpeded access to registered areas of our website. <br>                  
              <br>
            Information gathered through cookies also helps Us measure use of our Site. Cookie data allows Us to track usage behavior and compile data that We can use to improve the Site and target advertising. This data will generally be used in aggregate form; however, We may track specific users from time to time to help Us improve our products and services. 
            Sometimes, advertisers or third parties hosting data for Goldmic will issue cookies. We cannot control the use of these cookies or the information that they gather.<br>
