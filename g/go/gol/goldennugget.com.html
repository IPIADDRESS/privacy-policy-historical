<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<!--
<div class="imgright">

</div>
-->
	<h2>Effective Date: May 1, 2009</h2>
<p>We want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. We want to provide you with the means to control your privacy and give you a way to voice questions or concerns you may have.</p>
<p>When you use our website certain information about your online activity is collected. We use this information to determine our website users’ preferences, to design initiatives to meet those preferences, to eliminate online hassles, and to generally make your online Landry’s, Inc. (“Landry’s”) experience more satisfying. Very infrequently, we may initiate a program, service or survey that requests your name, birthday, e-mail address, city of residence, zip code, or information about what you like and do not like about Landry’s. We recognize that the loyalty of our customers depends upon our relationships with them and we strongly support the rights of customers to maintain privacy of personal data.</p>
	<h2>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</h2>
	<p>Like you, we have children of our own and are concerned about their 
		safety when they use the Internet. We want you and your family to be safe while 
		visiting our website. That is why, consistent with the Federal Children's Online 
		Privacy Protection act of 1998 (COPPA), personally identifiable information from 
		children, we have no intention of collection of any personally identifiable 
		information from individuals under 13 years of age. If a child under 13 years of 
		age has provided us with personally identifiable information, a parent or 
		guardian of that child can contact us at the e-mail address or phone number 
		listed in the Contact Us section of the website if they would like this 
		information deleted from our records. We will use reasonable efforts to delete 
		the child’s information from our existing records. For more information about 
		protecting the privacy and safety of minors online, we recommend you visit the 
		<a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online" target="_blank">COPPA website</a>.
	</p>
	<h2>What Information Do We Collect? 
	</h2>
	<p>We 
		collect information in several different ways. We collect the domain name of 
		visitors to our web pages, user-specific information on the pages visitors 
		access, and information such as survey information or other information that you 
		provide voluntarily. Like many other commercial websites, our website may employ 
		a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our 
		site is used. With respect to cookies: We use cookies to store visitors 
		preferences, record session information, record user-specific information on 
		what pages users access or visit, record past activity at a site in order to 
		provide better service when visitors return to our site, customize Web page 
		content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor 
		sends. 
	</p>
	<h2>How the Information Is Used 
	</h2>
	<p>We use the information that we collect to 
		understand your preferences and history using our website and related services. 
		With this information we make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our 
		website, any related services, and enjoy your guest experience at our 
		restaurants and venues. 
	</p>
	<p>Our ability to provide enhanced services may 
		occasionally depend on our ability to develop summary reports for our 
		advertising agents that contain raw numbers or statistics (but never tell them 
		who it was that stated a preference or clicked on an option). 
	</p>
	<p>It is our policy 
		to never send messages to website users unless they request that we do so.
	</p>
	<h2>Who 
		Has Access to Your Personal Information 
	</h2>
	<p>The information that you provide is 
		collected by Landry’s. In the 
		case of links to our gift card and guest recognition sites, the information you 
		voluntarily provide at those sites will only be shared with those service 
		vendors who help Landry’s administer its websites and the services they provide. 
		In any case, Landry’s is the lawful “owner” of the information and each of these 
		vendors may use the information only for the purpose of administering the 
		website and its services for Landry’s and will take all necessary precautions to 
		protect the information. Ownership of any information you provide us will be 
		held solely by Landry’s. We will not sell ownership of this data to any other 
		company or organization.	</p>
	<p>We will not transfer information to competitors. Your 
		information will always be used only to help us ensure that our website and any 
		related services meet your expectations. At Landry’s, your personal information 
		is safe. We don't give, share, sell, or lend your information.
	</p>
	<h2>Information 
		Distribution 
	</h2>
	<p>It is our strict policy not to share your personal information or 
		preferences with any third party, except as is necessary to operate and improve 
		our website, or to provide any service requested by you on our website.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;Although 
		unlikely, we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to 
		provide personally identifiable information to the appropriate governmental 
		authorities. If requested as part of a legal proceeding, we will provide this 
		information upon receipt of the appropriate documentation. 
	</p>
	<p>It is not our usual 
		policy but from time to time we may permit other companies to place advertising 
		on our website, and these companies may collect information about you through 
		the use of cookies when you view or click on their advertising or content (using 
		the same techniques described above). Due to the way the Internet operates, we 
		cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these 
		advertisers or content providers if you have any questions about their use of 
		the information they collect. 
	</p>
	<p>There may be links that will let you leave our 
		website, such as when purchasing a Landry’s gift card or finding out more about 
		the different Landry’s concepts. Except for websites directly related to Landry’s programs and 
		services, we cannot control the links or their websites and we are not 
		responsible for the contents of any linked website or any link contained in a 
		linked website. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement of the 
		website. The use and/or privacy provided by a linked website as to any 
		information you provide in accessing that website is in no way subject to our 
		privacy policy. Any linked website may have its own policy that could differ 
		considerably from our policy, or the linked website may not display any privacy 
		policy at all. In any case, even though a linked website is accessed through our 
		website, we cannot be responsible for any use that a linked website may make of 
		your information.
	</p>
	<h2>What Kind of Security Procedures Are in Place to Protect the 
		Loss, Misuse or Alteration of Information 
	</h2>
	<p>We operate 
		secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password 
		protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed 
		and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the 
		information provided by our customers. Any particularly sensitive information, 
		such as a customer's credit card number, is encrypted prior to transmission.		</p>
	<h2>Your Acceptance of These Terms	</h2>
	<p>By using this site, you agree to our 
		Privacy Policy. We may also change the policy from time to time, so please be 
		sure to visit this site often to see if anything has changed. If we post changes 
		and you continue to use the site, you will be deemed to have agreed to the 
		changes.
