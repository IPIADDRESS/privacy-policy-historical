<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p>The User-Friendly Phone Book (“User-Friendly”) has a firm commitment to privacy and created this privacy statement to disclose our privacy policies which include how your personal information is gathered, used, and disseminated for use through 247.com (the “Web Site”) this Web Site.&nbsp;This privacy policy applies only to information collected or obtained through this Web Site and not information obtained by other means. User-Friendly understands the importance of ensuring that your personal information is secure and protected and uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. We will not use or sell your personal information to third parties at any time unless when legally required to do so to cooperate with governmental authorities investigating claims of illegal activity which includes but is not limited to; illegal transfer of copyrighted material, Web Site postings or email messages containing threats of violence or as detailed below. We may also disclose personally identifiable information in other cases where we have reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use.</p>

<h4>Personal Information and Member Registration.</h4>
<p>To receive community services and membership benefits, the Web Site maintains a limited amount of your personal information given during Registration. The information provided prevents others from using the same log-in or Message Board(s) Screen Name. As registration on the site is completely voluntary, the user has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The type of information requested or collected by us includes: user contact information (name, email address, street address, phone number, log-in name password and screen name) and user demographic information (gender or age). The Web Site may also collect personal information from you if you choose to participate in activities such as sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys or because you want us to furnish you with products, services, newsletters, or information in connection with your use of social networking sites and public areas, or in connection with content or suggestions you submit to the Web Site.</p>
&nbsp;
<h4>Use of Personal Information.</h4>
<p>User-Friendly will only use the Personal Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If User-Friendly obtains Personal Information from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is also governed by this Privacy Policy. User-Friendly may share your Personal Information with companies that are affiliated with us, provided you have given us permission.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>User-Friendly will not share your credit card information with third parties except those User-Friendly uses to perform tasks required to complete purchases you make through the Web Site. User-Friendly employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your Personal Information. User-Friendly may share your Personal Information with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities including but not limited to; message boards, sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment and data processing, or with outside contractors, agents or sponsors who help us with administration, judging and prize fulfillment aspects of contests, sweepstakes and games. These outside contractors, agents, or sponsors may only use your Personal Information to provide User-Friendly with a specific service and not for any other purpose without your consent. User-Friendly may also provide your Personal Information to a third party in those instances where you have chosen to receive certain information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such a request requires the sharing of your Personal Information.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>User-Friendly may aggregate Personal Information and use it anonymously. Anonymous click stream, number of page views, calculated web beacons, and aggregated demographic information may also be shared with User-Friendly’s advertisers and business partners.</p>
