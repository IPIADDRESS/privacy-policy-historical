 </pre><p>Cookies Set By Google Analytics Google Analytics sets the following cookies as described in the table below</p><pre>  
   Name		Description	        
  __utma	This cookie is typically written to the browser upon the first visit to your site from that web browser. If the cookie has been deleted by the browser operator, and the browser subsequently visits your site, a new __utma cookie is written with a different unique ID. This cookie is used to determine unique visitors to your site and it is updated with each page view. Additionally, this cookie is provided with a unique ID that Google Analytics uses to ensure both the validity and accessibility of the cookie as an extra security measure.	       
  __utmb	This cookie is used to establish and continue a user session with your site. When a user views a page on your site, the Google Analytics code attempts to update this cookie. If it does not find the cookie, a new one is written and a new session is established. Each time a user visits a different page on your site, this cookie is updated to expire in 30 minutes, thus continuing a single session for as long as user activity continues within 30-minute intervals. This cookie expires when a user pauses on a page on your site for longer than 30 minutes. You can modify the default length of a user session with the _setSessionCookieTimeout() method.
  __utmc	Historically, this cookie operated in conjunction with the __utmb cookie to determine whether or not to establish a new session for the user. For backwards compatibility purposes with sites still using the urchin.js tracking code, this cookie will continue to be written and will expire when the user exits the browser. However, if you are debugging your site tracking and you use the ga.js tracking code, you should not interpret the existence of this cookie in relation to a new or expired session.	       
  __utmz	This cookie stores the type of referral used by the visitor to reach your site, whether via a direct method, a referring link, a website search, or a campaign such as an ad or an email link. It is used to calculate search engine traffic, ad campaigns and page navigation within your own site. The cookie is updated with each page view to your site.	   
  __utmv	This cookie is not normally present in a default configuration of the tracking code. The __utmv cookie passes the information provided via the _setVar() method, which you use to create a custom user segment. This string is then passed to the Analytics servers in the GIF request URL via the utmcc parameter. This cookie is only written if you have added the _setVar() method for the tracking code on your website page.	    
   </pre><h3>Where we store your personal data</h3><p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers, partners, advertisers and affiliates. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of any order for a Product that you make via or through the Website, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy but, in any event, the person or entity storing or processing your data will be part of the EEA or part of the United States “Safe Harbor” framework.</p><p>We have in place appropriate technical and security measures to prevent unauthorised or unlawful access to or accidental loss of or destruction or damage to your information.</p><p>We store your personal details on a secure server. We use industry standard security and firewalls on our servers. When we collect payment card details electronically, we use encryption by using a third party payment provider which will use encryption software. Whilst we are unable to guarantee 100% security, this makes it hard for a hacker to decrypt your details.</p><p>We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.</p><p>You are responsible for protecting against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer.</p><h3>Security</h3><p>Any payment transactions will be encrypted in the payment information you provide to us to pass on to a third party to make an order for a product or service; the encryption will be completed by the third party payment provider who we use from time to time which will use encryption software. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access an App or certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p><p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will take reasonable steps to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted over the Internet; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p><h3>Your Rights</h3><p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data, to provide information to you (whether by email or otherwise) or marketing information about the Products, the Website or Apps. You can email us on<a href="mailto:customerservices@goop.com"> customerservices@goop.com</a> to make these changes, or follow the “unsubscribe” link in any marketing communication that we send to you by email. You can also make changes to your privacy settings at the “<a href="/shop/customer/account/">My Account</a>” part of the Website. We will change what you receive within a reasonable time. However, changing your privacy settings may inhibit your ability to use the Website or receive any information or email that we offer or use an App, so we do not recommend that you do this.</p><p>The Website and an App may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites or mobile applications of suppliers, partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of those websites or mobile applications, please note that those websites and mobile applications have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for those policies. Please check those privacy policies before you submit any personal data to those websites or mobile applications. Changes to this Privacy Policy We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any amended Privacy Policy will be posted on the Website. The amended Privacy Policy will apply immediately for new users and 30 days (or such other timeframe as we say when posting) after first posting for all existing users. Each time you enter the Website, order a Product or download, install, access or use an App, you agree that the Privacy Policy current at that time shall apply to all information which we hold about you.</p><h3>Consent</h3><p>By submitting data to us, using the Website or downloading, installing, accessing or using an App, you consent to our use of your data and of anyone you represent (including, but not limited to, data relating to your then current location) in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy (as amended from time to time, as described above) and you are responsible for ensuring that you have authority to consent on behalf of anyone about whom you submit data to us.</p><p>You also consent to us (or third party advertisers working through the Website or an App) placing cookies on your hard drive or mobile device. You can turn these off if you want, through the settings on your browser. See the “IP addresses and cookies” section above. Please note that we will not place cookies on your hard drive by which you can be personally identified; if we do, we will ask for more, further, specific consent from you.</p><p><em>This Privacy Policy was most recently updated on 01 June 2014.</em></p></div></div></div>  </div>
