<p>GoodLayers (“us”, “we”, or “our”) operates the https://goodlayers.com website and <a href="https://demo.goodlayers.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://demo.goodlayers.com </a>which is the demonstration website of templates that we sell on Envato marketplace(<a href="https://market.envato.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://market.envato.com/</a>) (the “Service”, “Site”). You can read privacy policy of Envato here :&nbsp;<a href="https://envato.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://envato.com/privacy</a></p>
<p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>
<p>We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible from <a href="https://goodlayers.com">https://goodlayers.com</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h2>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
<p>An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://automattic.com/privacy/</a>. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.</p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.</p>
<h3>Contact forms</h3>
<p>Should you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect the data entered on the form, including the contact details you provide, to answer your question and any follow-up questions.</p>
<p>We got 2 kinds of contact forms on our website:</p>
<ol>
<li>Contact forms that send a direct mail to us</li>
<li>Contact forms that are used in our theme demos, which do not send emails and are just for visual presentation</li>
</ol>
<h3>Newsletter data</h3>
<p>If you would like to receive our newsletter, we require a valid email address as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and that you agree to receive this newsletter. When signing up we also collect a name by which to address you (you do not need to provide your real name if you do not want), the date you subscribed and were you signed up for the form. No additional data is collected or is only collected on a voluntary basis. We only use this data to send the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.</p>
<p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. You can revoke consent to the storage of your data and email address as well as their use for sending the newsletter at any time, e.g. through the “unsubscribe” link in the newsletter. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
<p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your subscription when said data will be deleted. Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remain unaffected.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.</p>
<p>If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.</p>
<p>When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.</p>
<p>If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Analytics</h2>
<h4>Google Analytics</h4>
<p>This website uses functions of the web analytics service Google Analytics.&nbsp;Provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
<p>Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”.&nbsp;These are text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you.&nbsp;The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>
<p>Google Analytics cookies are stored on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit.&nbsp;f DSGVO.&nbsp;The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
<p><strong>IP anonymization</strong></p>
<p>We have activated the function IP anonymization on this website.&nbsp;As a result, your IP address will be truncated by Google within member states of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to transmission to the United States.&nbsp;Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there.&nbsp;On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage to the website operator.&nbsp;The IP address provided by Google Analytics as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.</p>
<p><strong>Browser plugin</strong></p>
<p>You can prevent the storage of cookies by a corresponding setting of your browser software;&nbsp;however, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use all the features of this website to the fullest extent possible.&nbsp;In addition, you may prevent the collection by Google of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading the browser plug-in available under the following link and install:&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>&nbsp;.</p>

<p><strong>Demographics in Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>This website uses the demographics feature of Google Analytics.&nbsp;As a result, reports can be produced that contain statements on the age, gender and interests of the site visitors.&nbsp;This data comes from interest-based advertising from Google and third-party visitor data.&nbsp;This data can not be assigned to a specific person.&nbsp;You can disable this feature at any time through the ad settings in your Google Account, or generally prohibit the collection of your data by Google Analytics as outlined in the section “Opposition to Data Collection”.</p>
