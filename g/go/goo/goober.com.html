These privacy terms will complement the general terms and conditions as
well as the license agreement for the utilization of goober.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><b>1. Information of several terms</b></span>
<br>
<br>

businesslike circumstances.
<br>
<br>
"Registration data" is the individual-related data that has to be stated
at registration for the goober services.
<br>
<br>
"Goober platforms" describes the websites and the access software on
which goober provides services.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<span class="red"><b>2. Policies to process individual-related data</b></span>
<br>

data:
<br>
<br>
The ascertainment, processing and utilization of individual-related data
takes place in accordance with the German Data Protection Act and the
privacy terms of the European Union.
<br>
<br>
Goober utilizes your individual-related data exclusively to enable you
to use the internet services provided by goober for which you have to
register. In no case will goober sell your individual-related data or

or marketing purposes.
<br>
<br>

yourself which of the individual-related data can be viewed by other
goober members.Your individual-related data, or parts of it, is only
visible to non-members of goober when you explicitly allowed it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><b>3. Right of access to personal data</b></span>
<br>
<br>
You can always get access to your data you saved in goober, its origin
and function. Furthermore, you have the right to correct, delete and
lock wrong data. Please send an e-mail with your questions to <a href="mailto:support@chatcube.com">support@chatcube.com</a>.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<span class="red"><b>4. Registration information</b></span>
<br>
<br>

has to get and process registration information from certain
individual-related data at your registration. This data is the
following:
<br>
<br>
- Username
<br>
- Password
<br>

<br>
Within goober services, you will be addressed, identified and associated

optional. This supplement, however, can be very helpful for other goober
members to associate the username with a certain person. The e-mail
address should help communication between goober and members and
respectively when a member forgot his/her username or password. Goober
will in no case forward the e-mail address to any third person or let
any other person take notice of it.
<br>
<br>
<br>

additional information and which are not. Only goober members whom you

Every forum provided by goober has one or several moderators. The
respective moderator decides whether a forum is public or only
accessible by a certain group of people. It is also the moderator's
decision who has the permission to read and write in this specific
forum. This information will be shown for the respective forum and will
be visible to goober members and depending on the enabling of the
moderator where appropriate also for non-members.
<br>
When a forum of the goober services is labeled as "public" and the
moderator did not restrict the access rights of the respective forum,
the entries in the forum can not only be viewed by goober members but
also by non-members.
<br>

<span class="red"><b>8. Cookies</b></span>
<br>
<br>
After your registration, goober services uses cookies to be able to
identify you during your session. They are also used to improve
usability, efficiency and security. Cookies are text files which are
filed on your computer and saved by your browser. After your session is
ended, the cookie expires automatically.They are automatically deleted
after your visit. You can save this cookie permanently for an automatic
login with the function "automatically sign in at program start". The
cookie now contains parts of your login details in encrypted format.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><b>9. Log files</b></span>
<br>
<br>

A protocol file is created with every page view in which access data,
the server log, is stored. In this process, your IP address
(identification of your computer is possible), the product information
of the used browser, the remote host (name and IP address of the
computer which requests the site), time, status, the amount of data
transferred, as well as the name of the site from which you came to the
requested site (referrer) will be recorded. For this purpose, goober
applies the standard combined log file format from the apache web server
and uses the protocol data anonymized, this means without reference or
any other hints that would lead to your person. This data will only be
used for statistical evaluation (e.g. to evaluate the times of the day
with the most requests) and to analyse errors (e.g. inaccurate links).
<br>
<br>
If there is any suspicion that somebody is using goober platforms in an
illegal or antinomian way or contrary to contract, goober reserves the
right to check the log files for the last known IP address of these
goober members later.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><b>10. Search functions</b></span>
<br>

The goober services give you the possibility to use different search
functions at divers places. You get support to find other goober members
with similar interests or to get in contact with other goober members
who offer exactly that what you were looking for.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><b>11. Minimum age</b></span>
<br>
The minimum age for a membership with goober is 18 years.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<span class="red"><b>12. Changes of the privacy policy</b></span>
<br>
<br>
Goober reserves the right to change this privacy policy at any time.
There is no reason for a contractual or any other formal right towards
one party. Goober will inform you of any changes regarding this privacy
policy. You will receive this information via e-mail which you will be
asked for during the registration process.
