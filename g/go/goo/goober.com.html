<h3>goober Privacy Policy</h3>
						<p><br>
						The protection of your privacy is our highest priority. Therefor, goober sets a high value on the protection and security of your data and feels obliged to handle your individual-related data as well as your communication data as confidential as possible.<br>
						Below, we inform you about how your individual-related data is generated in goober and with which accuracy and diligence we deal with it.<br>

						Furthermore, you will find out how you can share these data with other users.<br>
						<br>
						These privacy terms will complement the general terms and conditions as well as the license agreement for the utilization of goober.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>1. Information of several terms</b><br>
						<br>

In no case will goober sell your individual-related data or show it to a third person for any reason, for instance for promotional or marketing purposes. <br>
						<br>

						<b>3. Right of access to personal data</b><br>
						<br>
						You can always get access to your data you saved in goober, its origin and function. Furthermore, you have the right to correct, delete and lock wrong data. Please send an e-mail with your questions to <a href="mailto:privacy@goobernetworks.com">privacy@goobernetworks.com</a>.<br>
						<br>

						<br>
						<b>4. Registration information</b><br>

Goober will in no case forward the e-mail address to any third person or let any other person take notice of it. <br>
						<br>
						<br>

It is also the moderator's decision who has the permission to read and write in this specific forum. This information will be shown for the respective forum and will be visible to goober members and depending on the enabling of the moderator where appropriate also for non-members. <br>
						When a forum of the goober services is labeled as "public" and the moderator did not restrict the access rights of the respective forum, the entries in the forum can not only be viewed by goober members but also by non-members.<br>

						<b>8. Cookies</b><br>
						<br>
						After your registration, goober services uses cookies to be able to identify you during your session. They are also used to improve usability, efficiency and security. Cookies are text files which are filed on your computer and saved by your browser. After your session is ended, the cookie expires automatically.They are automatically deleted after your visit. You can save this cookie permanently for an automatic login with the function "automatically sign in at program start". The cookie now contains parts of your login details in encrypted format. <br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>9. Log files</b><br>
						<br>

						A protocol file is created with every page view in which access data, the server log, is stored. In this process, your IP address (identification of your computer is possible), the product information of the used browser, the remote host (name and IP address of the computer which requests the site), time, status, the amount of data transferred, as well as the name of the site from which you came to the requested site (referrer) will be recorded. For this purpose, goober applies the standard combined log file format from the apache web server and uses the protocol data anonymized, this means without reference or any other hints that would lead to your person. This data will only be used for statistical evaluation (e.g. to evaluate the times of the day with the most requests) and to analyse errors (e.g. inaccurate links).<br>
						<br>
						If there is any suspicion that somebody is using goober platforms in an illegal or antinomian way or contrary to contract, goober reserves the right to check the log files for the last known IP address of these goober members later.  <br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>10. Search functions</b>
						<br>

						The goober services give you the possibility to use different search functions at divers places. You get support to find other goober members with similar interests or to get in contact with other goober members who offer exactly that what you were looking for.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>11. Minimum age</b>
						<br>
						The minimum age for a membership with goober is 18 years.<br>
						<br>

						<br>
						<b>12. Changes of the privacy policy</b><br>
						<br>
						Goober reserves the right to change this privacy policy at any time. There is no reason for a contractual or any other formal right towards one party. Goober will inform you of any changes regarding this privacy policy. You will receive this information via e-mail which you will be asked for during the registration process.<br>
