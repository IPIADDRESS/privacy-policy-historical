<br>
We typically use these cookies and similar technologies for essential and functional purposes (e.g. to maintain an active session), to improve the performance and usability of our Sites, and to analyze how users interact with the Services (e.g. to understand how long users stay on a page, how often they return, and how they arrived at our Site). On certain portions of our Sites we may collect data through these technologies for advertising, remarketing, or other similar purposes. Click-stream and related data is typically used for purposes of system administration, to improve our Services, for marketing and advertising-related purposes, and other similar uses.<br>
<br>
Some tracking technologies on our Services may be provided by a third party (which may collect information on its own behalf, or may provide such information to us). For example, we use Google Analytics on our Sites. Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect anonymous traffic data to help use analyze how users use the website. The information generated by a cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.

<p><strong>When You Contact us Through the Services</strong><br>
When you submit an online "contact us" or other online inquiry form, or when you call, write, fax or otherwise initiate contact with GoodTherapy.org, we record your contact information (name, address, phone number, email address, and topics, therapist type, or facility type of interest) in our systems. This information is used for answering your questions, connecting you with a Member or Facility, as well as ongoing marketing communication programs. In some cases, you may be referred to a GoodTherapy.org online inquiry form via a link on a third party referral website. In that case, any information collected on the GoodTherapy.org hosted online inquiry form may be shared with the referring party, and that referring party may use it for their own, non-GoodTherapy.org related, marketing communication programs. If you exchange any messages through our Sites or through our Services, we may store those as well.<br>
<br>
<strong>From Online Surveys</strong><br>
We may occasionally ask Users, Members, and Facilities to complete optional online surveys. These surveys may ask for contact information and demographic information (like zip code, age or income level). We may use this data to tailor the experience on the Sites, provide content that we think might be of interest, and to display content according to a User’s, Member’s or Facility’s stated preferences. We sometimes use contact data from our surveys to send information about our company and/or promotional material on behalf of our parent company, partners, subsidiaries or affiliates.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><br>

<p>The GoodTherapy.org Sites contain links to third-party websites. These links are provided for your convenience and to connect you with resources you may find useful.

<h2><br>
How We Share Information with Third Parties</h2>

<p>Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy or in accordance with any request or consent you provide, GoodTherapy.org does not sell, share, or in any other way transmit personal information (names, address, phone numbers, financial account information, Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI), etc.) submitted by Users, Members, or Facilities to any other persons or companies. We reserve the right, however, to use and disclose anonymous information to third parties, at our discretion. Except as limited below, third parties may use information we share with them for any purpose for which we may use such information.<br>
<br>
Personal information we collect may be shared with service providers who provide certain services on our behalf, including but not limited to, payment processing, business intelligence, customer relationship management, bill collection, marketing, hosting, and other common technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and you consent to our sharing with these parties by using our Service and accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy.<br>
We may provide information, including personal information of registered Members and Facilities to third party service providers and referral partners that work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the aspects of our services, to help us communicate with you, or to provide Members and Facilities with ancillary services offered by such service providers and referral partners. We may also receive information about you, including personal information, from our third party service providers and referral partners. However, these service providers and referral partners do not have any independent right to disclose this information (except to the same extent we would have a right to disclose that information under this Privacy Policy).<br>
<br>
If you use the Services to contact a Member or Facility via email or phone, we may grant access to or share with the Member or Facility any and all information we collect as part of that communication, including Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI), except where that disclosure is prohibited by law, regulation or other obligations (e.g. for data security).<br>
<br>
You hereby agree that we may share some or all of your personal information with a parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (collectively, "Affiliates"). We will require our Affiliates to comply with this Privacy Policy. If our company or some or all of our assets are acquired by another company, any personal or other information we possess may be a part of the assets transferred, and that company will possess any rights granted to us under this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
Finally, in extraordinary circumstances, we may share any personal or other information we possess, including but not limited to credit card and other financial account information, Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI), and content submitted via any form on the Sites, when necessary or appropriate to: comply with the law; cooperate with law enforcement or national security requirements; prevent physical harm to one or more individuals or serve the interest of public safety; respond to lawful requests; comply with law or credit card rules; participate in a lawful federal, state or local government investigation; protect the rights of GoodTherapy.org, GoodTherapy.org Users, Members, and Facilities; or to investigate violations of or to enforce our <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/termsandconditionsofuse.html">Terms of Service for Users</a>, <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/terms-service.html">Terms of Service for Members</a>, and <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/facility-terms-service.html">Terms of Service for Facilities</a>. However, in doing so, we may: (i) dispute demands for release to the extent we believe, in our sole discretion, are unwarranted, illegitimate or overbroad; and (ii) when we determine that it is necessary or appropriate, we will notify &nbsp;you of any requests for release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In all cases where we share Personal Information with third parties, we will use a "minimum necessary" standard to disclose only that information required to perform the service for which the information is disclosed.</p>

<h2>Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</h2>

<p>We will retain personal information for as long as you remain an active GoodTherapy.org User, Member or Facility, and for a reasonable time thereafter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may store for as long as a valid business reason exists, which may be indefinitely, any Personal Information, including but not limited to Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI), collected about a consumer or other individual, whether entered directly into our systems via the Sties by the consumer, or entered by an authorized GoodTherapy.org staff member, authorized Member User, or authorized Facility User. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We may retain anonymized and aggregate data indefinitely.</p>

<p>Upon termination of a contract with a Covered Entity, we will remove any ePHI stored in our systems on behalf of that Covered Entity where required by applicable law.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>GoodTherapy.org takes security very seriously and has security measures in place designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our platform uses the most powerful security tools that exist in the marketplace. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The GoodTherapy.org Sites, including hosted web forms, utilize secure SSL for all form data submissions in conjunction with a 256-bit GlobalSign certificate, but accommodate the majority of browsers at 128-bit encryption.</p>

<p>GoodTherapy.org does not directly store, process, or transmit bank account and credit card information. All payment processing, and collection of payment account data, is accomplished via an integration with third-party service providers. &nbsp;These providers are contractually required to maintain compliance with the PCI DSS - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, and with all NACHA rules for ACH transaction processing. &nbsp;This includes secure transmission of credit card/bank account information, and encrypted storage of all payment account information.</p>

<h2>Choice/Opt-Out</h2>

<p>You may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by following the opt-out instructions we include in such communications.<br>
<br>
You may unsubscribe from any GoodTherapy.org newsletter or blog by following opt-out instructions we include in such communications, or by completing the <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/unsubscribe.html">unsubscribe form</a> on our website.<br>
<br>
To the extent required by law, you may choose to opt out of sharing with any other parties with whom we may share your personal information; however, you may be unable to use the Services or certain features if you wish to limit such sharing.</p>

<h2><br>
Accessing, Correcting and Deleting your Information</h2>

<p>GoodTherapy.org acknowledges the right of individuals to access their personal data. If you are a Member or Facility, you may access and modify your personal and other account information using your account settings page. You may also access, change and modify information previously provided or collected by sending an email to GoodTherapy.org at privacy@goodtherapy.org to initiate changes or modifications or to obtain a file for review. Note that GoodTherapy.org will require you to verify your identity prior to releasing any personal information.</p>

<p>You may close your GoodTherapy.org Member of Facility account by contacting GoodTherapy.org Customer Care at 888-563-2112 or support@goodtherapy.org.<br>
<br>
Further, you may request that your personal information be removed from all GoodTherapy.org systems. This request must be made in writing to the address provided below. Note that if you request removal of your personal information you will no longer have access to any existing GoodTherapy.org account and will not be able to use any GoodTherapy.org product or service. GoodTherapy.org reserves the right to retain certain account information for its recordkeeping or compliance purposes.<br>
<br>
If you are a User who utilized GoodTherapy.org Services to contact or otherwise submit information to a Member or Facility, you must contact that provider/company directly to request that the Member/Facility provide you with access to the Personal Health Information (PHI/ePHI) stored in GoodTherapy.org systems on its behalf, that it make changes to that ePHI, and/or that the ePHI be deleted from GoodTherapy.org systems. &nbsp;Additionally, any Member or Facility that has received your personal information or PHI/ePHI via GoodTherapy.org Services may have stored it in systems outside of GoodTherapy.org. &nbsp;In these situations, you must contact the Member or Facility independently and request access to your personal information, correction of your personal information, and/or deletion of your personal information. &nbsp;GoodTherapy.org has no control over the data retention and removal policies of its Members or Facilities, and can in no way guarantee the security, accuracy, or privacy of data once it leaves our environments.<br>
<br>
Note that using the system delete function to remove any data, or to remove any personal data associated with your Member or Facility account, only restricts viewing that data from any system interface and prevents utilizing that data for any system function. It does not permanently delete the data from GoodTherapy.org systems. To have any personal data permanently deleted from GoodTherapy.org systems, you must make an official request in writing, to the address provided below or by emailing privacy@goodtherapy.org, that includes the specific information that you would like permanently deleted from GoodTherapy.org systems. Note that GoodTherapy.org will require you to verify your identity prior to executing any request to permanently delete data.</p>
