          We may invite you to participate in polls so you can easily share your opinions with others and see what our audience thinks about certain topics. Your opinion or responses are collected in the aggregate and do not identify individual Users. We may use a system to â€œtagâ€� Users after they have voted so we can ensure that Users vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with your personal information.

          One of the most exciting offerings on the Website will be an ongoing series of contests, which will allow you to compete with other Users for prizes. There will be contests built around recipes, videos, participation on the Website, or contribution of specific content.<br><br>
          Contest entry rules or procedures will be specific to each contest and spelled out in detail at the time the contest is offered. If you decide to participate you will be required to comply with the rules of the specific contest.<br><br>
