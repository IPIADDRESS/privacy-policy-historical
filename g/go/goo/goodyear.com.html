<b>Basic Confidentiality and Privacy Policy</b></font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">

The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company, hereafter `Goodyear',
considers personal information, such as your name, postal
and e-mail addresses or telephone number, to be private and
confidential. Accordingly, the personal information you
provide is stored in a secure location, is accessible only
by designated staff or authorized agents, and is used only
to market our products or better serve our customers.
Goodyear will not disclose any personal information to other
organizations.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">

<b>Information Collection</b></font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">

When you browse a Goodyear web site, you do so anonymously.
Personal information is not collected. Some areas of our web
sites, however, may request that you voluntarily supply us
with personal information, including your name, email
address, etc., for purposes such as correspondence, site
registration, making a purchase, or participating in online
surveys.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">

Goodyear may also retain electronic communications you send
to our customer service representatives, webmaster or other
associates. These may be shared only within Goodyear as a
means to continually improve customer service.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">

Goodyear web sites track information about the visits to
those sites. For example, statistics are compiled that show
the daily number of visitors to a site, the daily requests
received for particular files on a site, and what countries
those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are
used to customize our web site to better meet your needs and
may also be provided to others, but the statistics contain
no personal information and cannot be used to gather such
information.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">

There is a technology called "cookies" which can be used to
provide you with tailored information from a web site.  A
cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to
your browser, which may then be stored on your system.
Certain Goodyear sites may use cookies so that we can better
serve site users. You can set your browser to notify you
when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide
whether to accept it.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">

<b>Information Use</b></font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">

Goodyear may use the information users give us to, for
example, provide a service, measure consumer interest in our
various products and services or inform users about new
products and programs. These offers may be based on
information provided in surveys, information that may
indicate purchasing preferences or email sent to a Goodyear
site.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">

Any lists used to send you product and service offers are
developed and managed under strict conditions designed to
safeguard the security and privacy of customer personal
information. Goodyear will use reasonable effort to address
all requests to remove names from any postal mail or email
lists.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">

<b>Disclosure</b></font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">

Because Goodyear considers the individual information we
maintain to be confidential, our policy is to disclose no
personal information gathered on-line to third parties
unless release is required by law or is pertinent to
judicial or government investigations or proceedings.
Goodyear does not sell, rent or transmit personal
information to other organizations.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">

<b>Other Web Sites</b></font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">

Goodyear web sites may contain links to other sites, and we
make every effort to link only to sites that share our high
standards and respect for privacy. However, we are not
responsible for the content or the privacy practices
employed by other sites.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">

<b>Children</b></font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">

Goodyear has no intention of collecting any personally
identifiable information (such as name, address, or
telephone number) from individuals under sixteen years of
age. Where appropriate, Goodyear will specifically instruct
children not to submit such information on our web site.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">

<b>Disclaimer</b></font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">

By using a Goodyear site, you signify your assent to the
Goodyear On-line Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this
policy, please do not use our sites.  We reserve the right,
at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove
portions of this policy at any time.  Please check this page
periodically for changes.  Your continued use of our sites
following the posting of changes to these terms will mean
you accept those changes.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">
