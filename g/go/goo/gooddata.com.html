<p>Last Updated April 17, 2012</p>
<p><a href="//privacy-policy.truste.com/click-with-confidence/ctv/en/www.gooddata.com/seal_m" target="_blank" title="Validate TRUSTe privacy certification"><img alt="Validate TRUSTe privacy certification" src="//privacy-policy.truste.com/certified-seal/ctv/en/www.gooddata.com/seal_m.png" style="border: none"></a></p>

<p>GoodData is committed to protecting the privacy of your information. This Privacy Policy describes our web site privacy practices (“Privacy Policy”). This Privacy Policy applies to data collected by GoodData Corporation and its subsidiaries (“GoodData”) through the gooddata.com web site and other webpages that we operate in which we post a direct link to this Privacy Policy (each a “GoodData Site”). By voluntarily using a GoodData Site and/or providing data or other information via a GoodData Site, you are indicating your consent to this Privacy Policy and agree to be bound by its terms.</p>
<p>GoodData has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this Privacy Policy and associated practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe's program requirements including transparency, accountability, and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions. If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy please contact the GoodData Privacy Administrator at: <a href="mailto:privacy@gooddata.com?subject=GoodData%20Privacy%20Policy"></a><a href="mailto:privacy@gooddata.com">privacy@gooddata.com</a>. If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe by clicking <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request">here</a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with GoodData.</p>
<p>GoodData complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. GoodData has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view GoodData’s certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/ </a></p>
<p><strong>Personal Information </strong><br>
	You can visit a GoodData Site without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need certain personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) from you.</p>
<p>You may choose to provide us with Personal Information (such as your name, email address, phone number and company name) through a GoodData Site when you elect to register with GoodData in order to download or access our products or services. When you provide Personal Information in order to register with GoodData, such Personal Information will be used in order to provide you with access to the requested products, services content and/or information. We may also use the Personal Information to help us understand who is using our products and services and to help us manage business development activities. GoodData may also use Personal Information for marketing purposes. For example, GoodData may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in our products or services and to send you information regarding GoodData and its partners, such as information about promotions or events. If you tell us that you do not want us to use this Personal Information as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletters </strong><br>
	If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
	In addition, we sometimes collect anonymous information from visits to a GoodData Site to help us provide better customer service and to make a GoodData Site as user friendly as possible. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit and we also measure visitor activity on a GoodData Site. However, when we do so, we do so in ways that keep the information anonymous. GoodData may use this data to analyze trends and statistics. None of the information described in this paragraph is reviewed at an individual level.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies </strong><br>
	A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on all GoodData Sites. We do not add the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on a GoodData Site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate a GoodData Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. GoodData uses persistent cookies to store a unique cryptographic hash value so you don’t have to enter your username more than once on a given computer. The information stored does not contain any personally identifiable information.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Third Party Cookies </strong><br>
	A GoodData Site may use cookies that permit select third party partners to serve you GoodData-related content on their sites or elsewhere on the Internet. This is based on your prior visits to a GoodData Site. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>IP Addresses </strong><br>
	When you visit a GoodData Site, GoodData collects your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, GoodData uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which customers and visitors navigate a GoodData Site. GoodData also collects IP addresses from customers whey they log into the GoodData platform as part of GoodData’s security features.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Web Beacons/Usage Analytics </strong><br>
	GoodData employs, or our third party advertising partners employ, web beacons and usage analytics software that help us better manage content on a GoodData Site by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Web Sites </strong><br>
	A GoodData Site may contain links to other web sites. GoodData is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. The links from a GoodData Site do not imply that GoodData endorses or has reviewed the third party web sites. We suggest contacting the operators of those web sites directly for information regarding their privacy policies.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Project Invitations</strong><br>
	If you choose to invite others within your organization to a report or project on a GoodData Site, we will ask you for the other user’s name and email address. We will automatically send him/her a one-time email inviting him/her to visit a GoodData Site. GoodData stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Invited users may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@gooddata.com?subject=GoodData%20Privacy%20Policy"></a><a href="mailto:privacy@gooddata.com">privacy@gooddata.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Blogs/Forums/Chat Rooms/Bulletin Boards</strong><br>
	If you use a blog, forum, chat room or bulletin board on a GoodData Site (“Forum(s)”), you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit in a Forum can be read, collected, or used by other users of such Forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in a Forum.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Customer Testimonials </strong><br>
	GoodData may post customer testimonials on a GoodData Site, which may contain personally identifiable information. We obtain the customer’s consent prior to posting their testimonial.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Information and Other Information </strong><br>
	GoodData is not in the business of selling your Personal Information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Information may be part of the transferred assets.</li>
	<li>Related Companies: We may also share your Personal Information with our subsidiaries, affiliates and other related companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
	<li>Credit Card Processing: We use a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on GoodData’s behalf.</li>
	<li>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: GoodData, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</li>
	<li>Legal Requirements: GoodData may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of GoodData, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of a GoodData Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Joint Offerings </strong><br>
	From time to time, GoodData may partner with other companies to jointly offer products or services. If you purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly-offered product or service from us, GoodData may share information collected in connection with your purchase or expression of interest with our joint promotion partner(s). GoodData does not control our business partners’ use of the information we share with them, and their use of the information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may opt not to purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly offered product or service.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>International Transfer of Information Collected </strong><br>
	To facilitate GoodData’s global operations, GoodData may transfer and access information regarding GoodData customers from around the world, including the United States. This Privacy Policy shall apply even if GoodData transfers information regarding GoodData customers to other countries.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Data </strong><br>
	GoodData customers may electronically submit data or information to the GoodData platform for hosting and processing purposes (“Customer Data”). GoodData will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in the GoodData Terms of Use, or as may be required by law. In accordance with the GoodData Terms of Use, GoodData may access Customer Data only for the purpose of providing the GoodData services, preventing or addressing service or technical problems, at a GoodData customer’s request in connection with customer support matters, or as may be required by law.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Security </strong><br>
	Personal Information collected through a GoodData Site is kept in a secure database and all reasonable precautions are taken to secure this data. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from a GoodData Site may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to GoodData via e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Information to GoodData via the Internet. The security of your Personal Information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information on our registration pages or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p><strong>Choice/Opt-out </strong><br>
	If you no longer wish to receive our emails, newsletters or other communications you may unsubscribe at any time by using the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of such communication or by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@gooddata.com?subject=GoodData%20Privacy%20Policy"></a><a href="mailto:privacy@gooddata.com">privacy@gooddata.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Our Policy </strong><br>
	We may change our business and a GoodData Site from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for us to make changes to this Privacy Policy. GoodData reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically, and especially before you provide GoodData with any Personal Information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated at the top of this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of a GoodData Site after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Correcting, Updating and Accessing Your Personal Information; Other Questions </strong><br>
	You will have the right to contact us to request information about the Personal Information we have collected from you and to request the correction, modification or deletion of such Personal Information. To make such a request and/or to pose any other questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact GoodData via email at <a href="mailto:privacy@gooddata.com?subject=GoodData%20Privacy%20Policy"></a><a href="mailto:privacy@gooddata.com">privacy@gooddata.com</a>.
