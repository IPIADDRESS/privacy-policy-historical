If you do not provide us with certain required information, we may not be able to provide you with access to those services or products or respond to your request or communication.</p>
<p>For example, we may not be able to respond to your enquiry, assess your application, enter you in a promotion, or send you requested information.</p>
<h3>9. UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect and use is accurate, complete and up-to-date. However, the accuracy of the information we hold depends to a large extent on the information you provide. You can update (or request us to update) your personal information at any time. We ask you to keep your information as current as possible so that we may continue to provide you with useful information.</p>
<p>To update your details, please email us at reception@goodlife.com.au. Alternatively, if you have an online account with one of our businesses, you may update your details via your online account. If you would like to unsubscribe or “opt out” from receiving any direct marketing material from Goodlife, that option will be available in the relevant communication sent to you. We will respond to your unsubscribe request within a reasonable period after your request is made.</p>
<h3>10. HOW YOU CAN ACCESS, UPDATE OR REMOVE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>You have a right to request access to your personal information held by us. You are also able to update your details or request us to remove your details should you wish to “opt out” in the future. Should you wish to access, update or remove your details, please email us at reception@goodlife.com.au.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you have an online account with one of our businesses, you may be able to access the personal information we hold about you via your online account.<br>
If there is a lawful reason for not providing you with access, we will provide you with a written explanation and will inform you of the mechanism to complain about our refusal at that time.

<h3>11. SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
Goodlife takes reasonable steps to maintain the security of your personal information and to prevent the misuse, interference, loss, modification and unauthorised access to or disclosure of your personal information.
<p>We have implemented a variety of electronic and physical security measures to safeguard the privacy of your personal information. These measures include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>your information is stored on secured networks consistent with industry standards, and is only accessible by those employees and agents who have special access rights to such systems;</li>
    <li>our websites use a secure server so that credit card details provided when purchasing tickets or paying for memberships, for example, are transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology;</li>
    <li>industry-standard encryption technologies are used when transferring or receiving sensitive information supplied by users;</li>
    <li>where your information is in hardcopy form, such documents are stored in secured areas only accessible by those employees and agents with special access rights;</li>
    <li>our Eftpos terminals for credit card transactions at the retail outlets are PCI Compliant to provide necessary security over credit card data;</li>
    <li>our IT networks undergo necessary penetration testing to continually identify and remediate potential opportunities for unauthorised data access; and</li>
    <li>periodic data recon is carried out on our point of sale systems to ensure no credit card details are stored without encryption.</li>
</ul>
We also ensure where possible that our contractors, agents, commercial partners and third party service providers have the same information security measures in place. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant its complete security. No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have an online account with one of our businesses, your account will be able to be accessed by anyone who knows your login details. You should keep you login details, and any other information you use to remember these details, private and secure.
<p>We will not be responsible for any loss or harm that you may suffer as a result of a leak of your personal information unless we have breached this Privacy Policy or the Australian privacy laws.</p>
<h3>12. COOKIES</h3>
<p>Your websites use cookies for identification purposes and to allow certain functions on the websites to work such as the online shopping process. A cookie is a small string of information that a website transfers to your browser for identification purposes. The cookies we pass to your electronic device are anonymous and do not hold information about you and are not capable of revealing your personal identity. However, if you nevertheless prefer not to receive cookies, you can configure your Internet browser on your electronic device to reject them, or to notify you if they are being used. Rejecting cookies can, however, limit the functionality of our websites and the online shopping process.</p>

<p>All of our websites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to help the website analyse how users use the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of one of our websites (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States of America.
