Your privacy is important to us and we have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, and protect Personal Information (defined below) and Non-Personal Information (defined below) when you use the Site and your choices for managing your information preferences. By using the Site, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy and the <a href="terms-of-service.html" title="Terms of Service">Terms of Service</a> posted on the site.</p>
					
					<ol>
						<li>
							<span>Managing Information Preferences</span>
							
							<p>You may review, correct, update, or change your Personal Information, or remove your Personal Information from our direct marketing efforts, at any time by contacting us at:</p>
						
							<p>
								The Good Men Foundation<br>
								143 Newbury St., 6th Floor<br>
								Boston, MA 02116<br>
							</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span>Information you choose to Submit</span>
							
							<p>We collect information that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, billing information, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information ("Personal Information") only if you choose to share such information with us. For example, you may be required to provide us with certain Personal Information to register with the Site, enter contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions, subscribe to a newsletter, sign up for certain services available through the Site (such as text messages, mobile phone applications, and other communications services), make a purchase, and at other times. The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you decide not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Site or participate in certain services, contests, sweepstakes or other promotions.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span>Information we automatically Collect</span>
							
							<p>We may automatically collect information that does not reflect or reference an individually identifiable user ("Non-Personal Information") to help us understand how our users use the Site. Like most Web sites, we automatically collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files may include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider), the Web browser you used to visit the Site, the time you visited the Site, which Web pages you visited on the Site, and other anonymous Site usage data.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span>Cookies and Web Beacons</span>
							
							<p>We may use cookies (a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your Web browser) and Web beacons (an electronic file placed within a Web site that monitors usage). We may use cookies and Web beacons to improve the quality of the Site. Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your Web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the Site may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Certain of our Service Providers (defined below) may use cookies and Web beacons in connection with the services they perform on our behalf, including, without limitation, targeted ad serving.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span>How we use Personal Information and Non-Personal Information</span>
							
							<p>We use Personal Information and Non-Personal Information for internal purposes only, such as to notify you of new products or services, to send service notifications, to customize the content and advertising you see, to fulfill your requests for products and services, to improve the Site, to conduct research, to solicit your feedback and input about the Site, and to provide more relevant products, services, and advertisements on or through the Site. Personal Information and Non-Personal Information may be combined with data collected from other sources so that we may further improve the relevance of products, services, and advertisements offered on or through the Site. We will not sell, share, or rent Personal Information to third parties, and we will not otherwise disclose Personal Information to third parties, without your express permission or as expressly disclosed in this Privacy Policy.</p>
							
							<p>From time to time, we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours ("Service Providers"). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as Web hosting, and Web development, credit card processing, advertising, analytics tools, widget providers, and data management services. We provide our Service Providers with the information reasonably necessary for them to perform these services. Each Service Provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.</p>
							
							<p>We may use, and disclose to third parties, certain Non-Personal Information regarding the Site (e.g., number of visits, page views, number of registered members who reside in a particular geographic location, etc.). However, such information does not identify you individually.</p>
							
							<p>We may share Personal Information and Non-Personal Information with entities controlling, controlled by, or under common control with GMF. In the event that GMF is merged, sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information and Non-Personal Information in connection with such transaction.</p>
							
							<p>In certain instances we may disclose Personal Information and Non-Personal Information when we believe it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against persons or entities in order to protect GMF or our users or when we believe that the law or legal process requires such disclosure.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span>Public Areas</span>
							
							<p>Please be advised that, whenever you voluntarily post information to any community or interactive areas of the Site, such information can and may be accessed by the public. This means that any person or entity with access to such information can potentially use it for any purpose, including sending unsolicited communications.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span>Security</span>
							
							<p>Information that we collect is stored on servers that GMF manages, using standard security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information in an effort to protect information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through the Site, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit on or through the Site, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span>Children's Privacy Statement</span>
							
							<p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span>Privacy Policy Changes</span>
							
							<p>We may, in our sole and absolute discretion, change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post a copy of the Privacy Policy as changed on the Site. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your agreement to abide by the Privacy Policy as changed. If you object to any such changes, your sole recourse shall be to cease using the Site.</p>
