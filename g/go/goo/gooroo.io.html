We take reasonable steps to ensure that the overseas recipients of your Personal Data do not breach the privacy obligations relating to your Personal Data.</p><p>We may disclose your Personal Data to entities located outside of Australia, including the following:</p><ul><li>our related bodies corporate;</li><li>our data hosting and other IT service providers, located in various countries; and</li><li>other third parties located in various foreign countries.</li></ul><p>We may disclose your Personal Data to entities within Australia who may store or process your data overseas.</p><h2>Notifiable Data Breaches</h2><p>We take data breaches very seriously. Depending on where you reside our policy is:</p><h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you reside in Australia:</h3><p>In the event that there is a data breach and we are required to comply with the notification of eligible data breaches provisions in Part IIIC of the <em>Privacy Act 1988 </em>(Cth) or any other subsequent sections or legislation which supersede this Part IIIC, we will take all reasonable steps to contain the suspected or known breach where possible and follow the following process set out in this clause.</p><p>We will take immediate steps to limit any further access or distribution where possible. If we have reasonable grounds to suspect that the data breach is likely to result in serious harm to any individuals involved, then we will take all reasonable steps to ensure an assessment is completed within 30 days of the breach or sooner if possible. We will follow the guide published by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (if any) in making this assessment.</p><p>If we reasonably determine that the data breach is not likely to result in serious harm to any individuals involved or any remedial action we take is successful in making serious harm no longer likely, then no notification or statement will be made.</p><p>Where, following an assessment and undertaking remedial action (if any), we still have reasonable grounds to believe serious harm is likely, as soon as practicable, we will provide a statement to each of the individuals whose data was breached or who are at risk. The statement will contain details of the breach and recommendations of the steps each individual should take. We will also provide a copy of the statement to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.</p><h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you reside in the European Union of EFTA States:</h3><p>We will endeavour to meet the 72 hour deadline as imposed by the GDPR, to report any data breach to the supervisory authority where a data breach occurs that will likely be a risk to you.</p><p>Further, where there is likely to be a high risk to your rights we will endeavour to contact you without undue delay.</p><p>We will review every incident and take action to prevent future breaches.</p><h2>Integrity and Retention of Data</h2><p>We take all reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data we collect about you is accurate, up to date and complete. Where we collect that information from you directly, we rely on you to supply accurate information. We make it easy for you to keep your Personal Data accurate, complete, and up to date.
