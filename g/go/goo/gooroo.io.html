				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>We at MSGooroo Pty Ltd ("Gooroo", "MSGooroo", "we," "us," "our") know that our users ("you," "your") care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting or using the Application, Website or Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the ways outlined below.</p>

				<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Data") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Application, Website or Services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="clearfix">
				<h2>Types of data collected</h2>
				<p>Gooroo collects various types of Personal Data as explained in this document. We may use this Personal Data to personalize and improve the Services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests for the Services, to analyze how users utilize the Application, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may share certain types of Personal Data with third parties (described in this document). We collect the following types of information:</p>

				<h3>Information you provide</h3>
				<p>We collect, store, and utilize any data you knowingly provide to us. For example, we collect Personal Data such as your name, email address, employment history, and career goals. Failure to provide certain Personal Data may make it impossible for this Application to provide its service. We may anonymise your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners.</p>

				<h3>Information collected automatically</h3>
				<p>Whenever you interact with our Application, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested. Any use of Cookies - or of other tracking tools - by this Application or by the owners of third party services used by this Application, unless stated otherwise, serves to identify Users and remember their preferences, for the sole purpose of providing the service required by the User. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or mobile device to prevent or limit your computer or device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our Application’s features. If you click on a link to a third party website, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.</p>

				<p>When you visit the Application, whether as a Gooroo customer or a non-registered user just browsing, our servers automatically record Usage Data that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Application and the Services and for the Application’s technical administration, to increase our Application’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our Users’ needs.</p>

				<h3>Information collected from 3rd parties</h3>
				<p>Third party services (for example, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Google) allow this Application to access Data from your account on the third party service, and perform actions with it. These services are not activated automatically, but require explicit authorisation by the User. Personal Data collected includes information about the User, Contact email/s, Education History, Employment/Work History, Website and Current City/Location.</p>

				<h3>Other</h3>
				<p>Gooroo often introduces new features, some of which may result in the collection of new information. Furthermore, new partnerships or corporate acquisitions may result in new features, and we may potentially collect new types of information.</p>

				<p>The User assumes responsibility for the Personal Data of third parties published or shared through this Application and declares to have the right to communicate or broadcast them, thus relieving the Data Controller of all responsibility.</p>

			</section>


			<section class="clearfix">
				<h2>How we use your personal data</h2>
				<p>Data concerning the User is collected to allow the Application to provide its services. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Data in personally identifiable form to anyone. Where we transfer information to persons outside Australia we believe that the recipients of such information are subject to a law, binding scheme or contract which effectively upholds principles for fair handling of the information that are similar in all material respects to the National Privacy Principles outlined in the Privacy Act.</p>

				<p>We share Personal Data in personally identifiable form with third parties only as described below:</p>

				<h3>Service providers</h3>
				<p>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide the Services to you. Unless we tell you differently, such third parties do not have any right to use the Personal Data we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. This includes third party companies and individuals employed by us to facilitate our Services, including the provision of maintenance services, database management, web analytics and general improvement of the Services.</p>

				<h3>Partners and advertisers</h3>
				<p>We disclose and/or make available Personal Data to third parties and/or their nominees. The use of your information (personal or otherwise) by these third parties is not within the control of Gooroo and we cannot accept responsibility for the conduct of these companies. This is also the case in respect of a Gooroo Profile that has been provided by Gooroo to an Advertiser.</p>

				<p>Advertisers on Gooroo, and those that purchase Gooroo Paid Services are asked by Gooroo to comply with all relevant obligations relating to the use and disclosure of personal information that are outlined in the Privacy Act. Gooroo cannot however guarantee compliance with these obligations.</p>

				<p>You may directly contact Advertisers to request access to any Personal Data that you have sent as part of an application or that has been provided to them as part of a Gooroo Profile.</p>

				<h3>Employers and recruiters</h3>
				<p>We offer tailored people-search functionality along with communication tools as part of our Gooroo Employer services. These services allow subscribers - generally, enterprises and professional organisations - to export limited information from Users’ public profiles, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location, in order to effectively manage candidate sourcing. You may limit or prevent this service from exporting your profile information by configuring your public profile visibility settings to restrict access to these fields. We do not provide email or other contact information to recruiters and employers. However, if you post that information as part of your profile it will be available to others.</p>

				<h3>Business transfers</h3>
				<p>We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Also, if we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Data would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>

				<h3>Protection of Gooroo and others</h3>
				<p>We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or a court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Gooroo, our employees, our Users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

				<h3>With your consent</h3>
				<p>Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Data may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information. </p>

			</section>


			<section class="clearfix">
				<h2>Additional information</h2>
				<h3>Legal Action</h3>
				<p>The User's Personal Data may be used for legal purposes by the Data Controller, in Court or in the stages leading to possible legal action arising from improper use of this Application or the related services.</p>

				<h3>The rights of Users</h3>
				<p>Users have the right, at any time, to know whether their Personal Data has been stored and can consult the Data Controller to learn about their contents and origin, to verify their accuracy or to ask for them to be supplemented, cancelled, updated or corrected, or for their transformation into anonymous format or to block any data held in violation of the law, as well as to oppose their treatment for any and all legitimate reasons. Requests should be sent to the Data Controller at the contact information set out above.</p>

				<h3>Changes to this privacy policy</h3>
				<p>The Data Controller reserves the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time by giving notice to its Users on this page. It is strongly recommended to check this page often, referring to the date of the last modification listed at the bottom. If a User objects to any of the changes to the Policy, the User must cease using this Application and can request the Data Controller to erase the Personal Data. Unless stated otherwise, the then-current privacy policy applies to all Personal Data the Data Controller has about Users.</p>
