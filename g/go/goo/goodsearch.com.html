				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				
				<h3>WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS</h3>
				<p>GoodSearch (including the GoodSearch Search Engine, GoodShop Mall and GoodPetitions), 
				takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.</p>
				<h4>How GoodSearch Uses Your Personal Information</h4>
				<p>This policy covers how GoodSearch treats personal information that GoodSearch collects 
				and receives, including information related to your past use of GoodSearch products and 
				services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable 
				like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise 
				publicly available.
				</p>

				<h3>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h3>
				<h4>General</h4>
				<p>The GoodSearch Search Engine and GoodShop Mall do not require any personally identifying information.</p>
				<p>GoodSearch collects limited non-personally identifying information and records information from your 
				computer and browser, including your IP address, the date and time of your query, GoodSearch cookie information, 
				software and hardware attributes, and the page you request.  We use this information to operate, develop 
				and improve our services.</p>
				<p>Some of our services, including registering your nonprofit with GoodSearch and signing a petition 
				on GoodPetitions may require you to provide personally indentifying information (typically your name, 
				e-mail address, and mailing address).</p>
				<p>When we require personally identifying information, we will inform you about the types of information 
				we collect and how we use it. We hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing your 
				personal information with us.</p>


				<h3>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</h3>
				<p>GoodSearch does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people 
				or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, 
				when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You have signed a petition on GoodPetitions sponsored by one of our participating 
					organizations.  When signing a petition, you are often asked for information such as name, 
					city, state, country, email and street address.  This information is treated as 
					public information and could be shared with the targets of the petitions such as members 
					of Congress or the press. This information may be used to validate your signature. 
					In addition, unless you have requested to be listed as "anonymous," the information 
					(excluding your email and street address) will also be available on GoodPetitions.com. 
					In addition, for the petitions listed on our site which are sponsored by one of our 
					participating organizations, we give users the opportunity to receive email newsletters 
					and/or other communication from the sponsoring organization. If you opt-in to participate 
					in this, GoodPetitions will send the required contact information along to the 
					3rd party provider.</li>
					<li>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with GoodSearch 
					under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help 
					GoodSearch communicate with you about offers from GoodSearch and our marketing partners. 
					However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
					</li>
					<li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise 
					our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
					</li>
					<li>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, 
					or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential 
					threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of GoodSearch's terms of use, 
					or as otherwise required by law.
					</li>
					<li>
					We transfer information about you if GoodSearch is acquired by or merged with another company.
					In this event, GoodSearch will notify you before information about you is transferred and 
					becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
				</li>
				</ul>
				<p>GoodSearch displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers 
				(including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click 
				targeted ads meet the targeting criteriaâ€”for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular 
				geographic area.
				</p>
				<ul>
				<li>GoodSearch does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact 
				with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting 
				to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting 
				criteria used to display the ad.
				</li>
				<li>GoodSearch advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, 
				stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, 
				and software companies).
				</li>
				</ul>
				<p>GoodSearch works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different 
				industries and categories of business.
				</p>

				<h3>COOKIES</h3>
				<p>GoodSearch may set and access GoodSearch cookies on your computer.</p>
				<p>GoodSearch lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access 
				their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own 
				privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to GoodSearch's 
				cookies.</p>
				<h4>Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Nonprofit's Account Information and Your Email Preferences
				General</h4>
				<p>You can edit or delete your nonprofit's account information and your email preferences, 
				at any time.</p>
				<p>
				New categories of marketing communications might be added from time to time. Users can opt 
				out of receiving future marketing communications from these new categories or they 
				can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages they receive.
				</p>
				<p>
				We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the GoodSearch service, 
				such as service announcements, administrative messages and the GoodSearch Newsletter, that 
				are considered part of your GoodSearch account, without offering you the opportunity to opt 
				out of receiving them.
				</p>

				<h3>CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</h3>
				<p>We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably 
				need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or 
				in order to do their jobs.
				</p>
				<p>We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations 
				to protect personal information about you.
				</p>
				<h3>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
				<p>GoodSearch may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way 
				we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in 
				your GoodSearch account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.</p>
