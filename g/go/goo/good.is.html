          <p>This privacy policy is a legal notice about how we use personal information collected on this website. The information below outlines what information is collected (yes, we do collect some), how we may use that information (we may use some of it), the persons to whom the personal information may be disclosed, and the security measures taken to protect the personal information.</p>
          <div class="legal">
            <p>Last Updated on June 28, 2012.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for GOOD.is, GOOD Finder, GOOD Maker, GOOD Mobile, the Daily GOOD, the GOOD Store, and GOOD Magazine online (collectively referred to as “GOOD”). If you have questions or concerns about any aspect of this policy, please feel free to contact our Privacy Policy Coordinator as follows:</p>
            <p>Privacy Policy Coordinator (Web)<br>GOOD Worldwide, LLC<br>6380 Wilshire Blvd<br>15th Floor<br>Los Angeles, CA 90048</p>
            <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. You can access the Privacy Policy anytime at www.good.is/privacy. Your use and/or registration on any aspect of GOOD will constitute your agreement to this Privacy Policy. This privacy policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including, without limitation, offline and on sites linked to from GOOD.</p>
            <p>1. What this Policy Covers. This policy covers our treatment of information that we obtain when you visit GOOD. This policy does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as our partners or advertisers. In addition we may provide links to other services and on occasion links to other sites that may interest you. All of these sites own independently of GOOD and they have their own privacy and security practices. For your best on-line experience, we encourage you to review their privacy policies before submitting personal information to them.</p>
            <p>2. Information GOOD Gathers. Information GOOD gathers generally falls into two categories: (1) personally identifiable information, which is gathered with your specific knowledge and consent, for instance when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey, make a purchase, subscribe to our publication(s), or register for any portion of our services, you are asked to provide information such as your email address, name, and phone number, and (2) non-personally identifiable information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected as you navigate use of GOOD.</p>
            <p>2.1. Personally Identifiable Information That You Give Us</p>
            <p>2.1.1. Registration. Registration for GOOD requires that you supply certain personally identifiable information including, in most cases, a unique email address and demographic information to register. Purchases made through GOOD require that you supply your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, and other billing</p>
            <p>2.1.2. Paid Products and Services. To enable the purchase subscriptions to GOOD Magazine and other products from our store, we collect and store billing and credit card information. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete purchase transactions. Examples of this include order fulfillment and credit card payments.</p>
            <p>2.1.3. Registration for Our Website via Third-Party Tools. You may choose to log-on, create, or enhance your profile on GOOD.is with the Facebook Connect feature on GOOD.is. By doing this, you are asking Facebook to send us registration information from your Facebook profile. We treat that information as we do any other information you give us when you log-on, register, or create a profile.</p>
            <p>2.1.4. User Generated Comments and Public Activities (including Comments and Facebook and Twitter sharing). We offer you opportunities to engage in public activities on GOOD. “Public Activities” are any actions you take on GOOD.is or Twitter and Facebook that are designed to be visible to other users on GOOD.is, including comments, GOOD Asks responses, and posting to Facebook or Twitter. Any information you disclose in your Public Activities, including your screen name, any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by GOOD for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. If you chose to engage Public Activities, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you choose to submit there can be read, collected, and used by other readers of these areas, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums and GOOD has no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any Public Activities.</p>
            <p>If you have signed up for a GOOD account, we will track and aggregate your Public Activities on GOOD.is. If you choose to participate in Public Activities, you are electing to share and display such Public Activities on GOOD.is. Also, Public Activities may be included in RSS feeds, APIs, and made available to other websites in other formats. As a result your Public Activities may appear on other websites, blogs, or feeds.</p>
            <p>2.1.5. Contests, Sweepstakes, and Special Offers. GOOD may collect information from you in connection with contests, sweepstakes, and special offers. If this information is shared with a third party, we will notify you at the time of collection, if you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest, or special offer.</p>
            <p>2.1.6. Surveys, Panels, and Market Research. GOOD may collect personal information from you in connection with voluntary surveys. Unless we notify you at the time of collection, the information you provide in response to optional survey questions may be shared, but only in aggregate, with advertisers and partners.</p>
            <p>2.2. Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Using Technology.</p>
            <p>2.2.1. Device Information. We may collect information about the computer, mobile telephone, smart phone, or other device you use to access GOOD.</p>
            <p>2.2.2. Cookies and Web Beacons. We use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there. You will not be able to access certain areas of GOOD, if your computer does not accept cookies from us.</p>
            <p>2.2.3. Analytics Technologies. We have hired third parties to provide us information, reports and analysis about the usage and browsing patterns of the users of GOOD. The non-personally identifiable information is collected to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site, and gather aggregate information about our user base as a whole. We do not tie this data to personally identifiable information.</p>
            <p>2.2.4. Log Files and Reading History. We automatically log certain information about your use of GOOD. This information includes reading history of the pages you view. We may use this information to provide you with customized recommendations based on your reading history. We also use log files in aggregate usage of GOOD.</p>
            <p>3. How GOOD Uses the Information We Gather</p>
            <p>3.1. Services You Request. GOOD uses personally identifying information you supply to provide you with the service you have requested.

            <p>We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products, or services and/or to improve the services we offer by tailoring them to your needs. Similarly, if you enter an online contest, sweepstakes, or giveaway, we will use the information you provide to notify you.</p>
            <p>3.2. Analysis. We perform statistical, demographic, and marketing analysis of users of GOOD for product development purposes and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our users. We also use this information to improve customer relationships.</p>

GOOD will allow access to our database by third parties that provide services on our behalf, including credit-card and billing processing, shipping, email distribution, list processing, and analytics or promotions management.

            <p>3.4. Affiliates and Partners. Unless otherwise specified elsewhere on GOOD, we may share personally identifying information with our affiliates, and with carefully selected partners.</p>
