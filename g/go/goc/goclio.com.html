        <h3>Information Collection &amp; Use</h3> 
        <p>Themis Solutions Inc. collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site.</p> 
        <h3>Registration</h3> 
        <p>In order to use this Web site, you must first complete the registration form and create a user name and password.  We collect your personally identifiable information during registration where you are required to provide your contact information (such as name, phone number, and email address) we also request your financial information, [bank account number &amp; routing information) to set up your account. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. <br> 
    You have the option to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender) to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site. </p> 
        <p>We will occasionally send you information on products, services, and promotions.</p> 
        <h3>Subscription</h3> 
        <p>Clio is a subscription based service, as a registered member we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form to process your subscription. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, physical address, company name and address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). <br> 
    We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.</p> 
        <h3>Account Information</h3>

This information is not used for any promotional purposes by Goclio.com.

    After you register, we will occasionally send you information on product updates, new product, services, and promotions.</p> 
        <h3>Surveys or Contests</h3> 
        <p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). </p> 
        <p>We use this information to to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), and to send participants an email newsletter.</p> 
        <p>We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company is will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p> 
        <h3>Tell-A-Friend</h3> 
        <p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Themis Solutions Inc. stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. <br> 
    Your friend may contact us at support at goclio.com to request that we remove this information from our database.</p> 
        <h3>Uses of Information</h3> 
        <p>Themis Solutions Inc. uses the collected information for the purposes of understanding our users’ geographic and demographic distribution, to improve and modify our products to better meet our users needs, and to enable effective communication with our customers.</p> 
        <h3>Communications from the Site</h3> 
        <h3>Special Offers and Updates</h3> 
        <p>We will occasionally send you information on products, services, and promotions. </p> 
        <p>Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the “Choice and Opt-out.” </p> 
        <h3>Newsletters</h3> 
        <p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section.</p> 
        <h3>Service-related Announcements</h3> 
        <p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. </p> 
        <p>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p> 
        <h3> 
    Customer Service</h3> 
        <p> 
    Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes put forth at the time of registration.
     
        </p> 
        <h3> Log Files</h3> 
        <p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. </p> 
        <p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. </p> 
        <p>We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. We use a third-party tracking service (Google Analytics) that uses cookies [log files] to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.</p> 
        <h3>Cookies</h3> 
        <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p> 
        <p>We use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. For more information on cookies see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie.</p> 
        <p>We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. </p> 
        <p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.</p> 
        <h3>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h3> 
        <p>We, or our third party advertising partner, may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. <br> 
    We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.” </p> 
        <h3>Profile</h3> 
        <p> 
    We store information that we collect through cookies, and log files to create a “profile” of your preferences. We do not tie your personally identifiable information, to information in the profile. We use this information in order to provide you a tailored user experience while on our site. [Such as remembering your password so you don’t need to log-in each time.] <br> 
    We do not share your profile with other third parties.</p> 
        <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3> 
        <h3>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</h3> 
        <p>We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers. This information does not identify individual users.</p> 
        <p>We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information. </p> 
        <h3>Agents </h3> 
        <p>We use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for subscription services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use your personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p> 
        <h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3> 
        <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, or legal process served on our Web site.</p> 
        <h3>Choice/Opt-out</h3> 
        <p>We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. </p> 
        <p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at support at goclio.com.</p> 
        <p>You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.</p> 
        <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3> 
        <p>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Themis Solutions Inc. Please be aware that we, Themis Solutions Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. </p> 
        <p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. <br> 
    This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site. </p> 
        <h3>Blogs</h3> 
        <p>If you use a blog, bulletin board or chat room on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p> 
        <h3>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h3> 
        <p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on your account information page or by emailing our Customer Support at support @ goclio.com.</p> 
        <h3>Security</h3> 
        <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p> 
        <p>When you enter sensitive information (such as your credit card number) during the payment process we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) to ensure its safety. To learn more about SSL, follow this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer.</p> 
        <p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at support at goclio.com</p> 
        <h3>Business Transitions</h3> 
        <p>In the event Themis Solutions Inc. goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email and a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p> 
        <h3>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h3> 
        <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. </p> 
        <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p> 
        <h3>Contact Us </h3> 
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us: <br>
