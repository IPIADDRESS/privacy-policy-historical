      <li>Various other functionalities and services as they are added to the Sites.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>5.  Who does Universal Uclick share Personal Information with?</h2>
    <p>Universal Uclick is the owner of all information collected from the Sites. We share your Personal Information with our affiliates, suppliers, vendors, and/or their agents and employees as we deem necessary for the provision of goods and services to you. Specifically, we may share your Personal Information or other data (i) with third parties assisting us in the provision, administration, and management of goods and services generally; (ii) with third parties that assist us in providing goods and services that you request; (iii) with third parties that support our business operations or provide marketing or advertising services on our behalf, including marketing, technical, accounting, legal or other professionals; and (iv) as otherwise required or permitted by law or approved by you. We may use your Personal Information for our general business operations and goods and services provided by us if it is in a form that is not capable of being personally identified with you or if it is combined with Personal Information from one or more other customers in aggregate form that does not personally identify any particular customer.  We may also sell, license or otherwise provide such de-identified or aggregated data to third parties.  </p>
    <p>We will not share your Personal Information with third parties for their own use unless you have “opted-in” to such sharing. If you have previously opted-in to such sharing under a prior privacy policy version, you are still considered to have opted-in under this Privacy Policy. Regardless of whether you opt-in, Universal Uclick may use your Personal Information for its own purposes as described herein.</p>
    <p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets, and, depending upon the transaction, your Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets. In the event that Universal Uclick or any Site is acquired by another company, your Personal Information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.</p>

    <h2>6.  What are my options to control the use of my Personal Information?</h2>
    <p>You have the ability to request the deletion of your Universal Uclick registration at any time by utilizing the registration system established for this purpose. However, we may maintain certain information, including Personal Information, following such deletion, as part of our internal processes to prevent accidental loss of user data or information and to prevent or discourage fraudulent activities that may involve Universal Uclick registration or account information. We may also continue to maintain information about your registration or account and your computer access to our Sites or services as part of our server logs</p>
    <p>Unless you opt-out or unsubscribe, we may e-mail you with information about other products and services of Universal Uclick, including information about selected third parties. If you do not want to receive such additional information from Universal Uclick, you may decline to receive those email messages by opting out when you receive such a communication, sign-up, register, or from within your account, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, we may communicate with you by e-mail if such e-mail communication is for the purpose of corresponding with you regarding products or services you have requested, related to protecting your interests, including any Personal Information, property, or other data, or to provide you with any notification or disclosure that may be required by applicable law or this Privacy Policy. Accordingly, you agree that all communications, disclosures, and notices sent to you by e-mail satisfy any requirement that notice be provided in writing.</p>
    <p>You may opt-out of allowing us to have any access to your location data by disabling your device's location detection functionality or GPS or, if possible on your device, disabling permission for our Sites to access such location detection functionality or GPS.</p>

    <h2>7.  How do I update my Personal Information?</h2>
    <p>You can help Universal Uclick maintain the accuracy of your profile by notifying us when you change your address, phone number, e-mail address, or other information. If at any time you wish to update your Personal Information then contact us or edit the information within your account, if applicable. Please include your old and new contact information in any message so that we can make the appropriate corrections.</p>

    <h2>8.  Children's Personal Information?</h2>
    <p>The Sites are general audience sites and are not directed to children under the age of 13. Universal Uclick assumes products and services purchased by credit card are purchased by adults. Universal Uclick respects the privacy of parents and children and is committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). On those areas of the Sites that ask for age, Universal Uclick does not collect Personal Information from individuals who identify themselves as under the age of 13 except in those limited circumstances where Universal Uclick believes that such collection is permitted under COPPA.</p>
    <p>Universal Uclick may ask prospective users to provide their age during the registration process and on other areas of the Sites. If a user indicates that he or she is under the age of 13, then all personal data collected during the registration process is automatically deleted except Universal Uclick may retain and use limited information, such as the child's e-mail address, for a limited period of time, in those cases where Universal Uclick believes that the collection and use of such information is permitted under COPPA.</p>
    <p>If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to Universal Uclick, he or she can contact us via e-mail or postal mail as listed below. Universal Uclick will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13.</p>
    <p>Universal Uclick believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can help prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without parental permission.</p>

    <h2>9.  Universal Uclick's Data Security.</h2>
    <p>We use a variety of commercially reasonable security technologies to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.  However, the use of such security technologies is not, and should not be considered to be, any type of guarantee or warranty by us that your Personal Information will not be accessed by third parties, or that we will use all available security technologies to prevent unauthorized access to, use, or disclosure of your personally identifying information.  While we use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard your Personal Information while it is being transmitted or used by third parties, we do not warrant that your Personal Information will be transmitted without unauthorized interception or modification or that your Personal Information will not be access or compromised by unauthorized third parties.  We may permanently delete or destroy any and all Personal Information at any time as determined by us.  </p>
    <p>Except as otherwise provided in this Policy, we will not share your Personal Information with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to: </p>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Comply with a law (or based upon our good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary to comply with a law); </li>
      <li>Protect our rights or property; or</li>
      <li>Enforce this Policy or any of our other policies and guidelines.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Always remember to sign off the Sites and close your browser window when you are finished using it. This helps prevent others from posing as you online. This is especially important if you use a system that is accessible to others, such as the library, at school, at the workplace or at an Internet café to access the Sites.</p>

    <h2>10. Advertisements and Third Party Websites</h2>
    <p>Our Sites may contain links to other websites.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.  We may allow third-party advertisers to place ads on our Sites.  These third-party advertisers may use cookies or similar technologies to help present the advertisements to you or to help measure the effectiveness of their advertisements.  Some advertisers may use cookies to serve ads based on your visits to the Sites and other websites on the Internet.  The use of such technologies is subject to the privacy policies of the third-party advertisers and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.
