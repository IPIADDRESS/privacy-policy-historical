      <font face="arial">

        <font face="verdana, helvetica, arial" size="4"><b>THE INTERNET, PRIVACY, AND GO NETWORK </b></font><p></p>
        <p>The Internet contains a wealth of information. Unfortunately, it may also contain
        personal details about you that you don’t want everyone to know. For example, your
        real name (lots of people on the Internet use aliases, alter egos or nicknames), street
        address, phone number, or e-mail address. Also, when you go online, sites you visit may be
        gathering information about you --- without your knowledge.</p><br>
        <p><b>GO Network's Policy</b></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">GO Network’s policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our
        users. GO Network and the Go Network Affiliates will never willfully disclose individually
        identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving
        that customer's permission. This policy statement tells you how we collect information
        from you and how we use it. Using the Internet should be a fun experience and we want to
        help you make it so. </p>
        <p>GO Network shares information about our users with advertisers, business partners,
        sponsors and other third parties. However, in most cases, we talk about our users in
        aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we will say GO Network’s audience is x
        percent females and y percent males. This data is used to customize GO Network content and
        advertising for our users.</p>
        <p>There are cases where GO Network may ask you for personal information such as your name
        or address. We do this when you register for contests/promotions or services that require
        registration or subscription (for example, chat). GO Network needs to collect this
        information for fulfilling prizes, tracking/verifying compliance with GO Network policies
        as well as federal, state and local laws and/or for editorial and feedback solicitation
        purposes. When we intend to use your personal information, we tell you up front. This way
        you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. For example, we may
        want to post the names of contest winners on our site or send you materials via e-mail or
        regular mail at your request. In case you change your mind or some personal information
        may change (such as your marital status), we will endeavor to provide a way to correct,
        update or remove the personal data you give us.</p>
        <br>
        <b>Policies for Individuals Under 13 Years of Age</b><p></p>
        <p>GO Network encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children
        and to participate in the activities offered on the sites. No information should be
        submitted to or posted at GO Network by guests under 13years of age without the consent of
        their parent or guardian. </p>
        <p>Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, GO Network does not provide any
        personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any
        purpose whatsoever. All registrants receive e-mail confirming their Registration. In
        addition, when a guest under 13 registers, his/her parent or guardian receives an e-mail
        alerting them to that Registration. No information collected from guests under 18 years of
        age is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside
        GO Network except as explicitly stated during registration for contests or promotions.</p>
        <p>Although guests under 13 years of age are allowed to participate in contests and
        promotions, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parents or
        guardians identified in the initial registration process. Publication of contest winners
        names and ages for individuals under 18 require parental or guardian consent during
        contest registration.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Use of Cookies</b></p>
        <p>Upon your first visit to GO Network, GO Network sends a "cookie" to your
        computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It stores personal
        preferences and user data. In no way does this tell us that you are "Bob
        Smith." </p>
        <p>GO Network has two primary uses for its cookies. First, we use them to specify unique
        preferences. For example, in GO Network’s News Center, users can specify keywords
        across several news categories. This way you don’t have to tell us over and over
        again about the kinds of news stories you want to see. Secondly, we use cookies to track
        user trends and patterns. This helps us better understand and improve areas of the GO
        Network service that our users find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the
        use of a "cookie," visitors to GO Network always have the option of disabling
        cookies via their browser preferences. </p>
        <p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to
        refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts
        of the GO Network service may not function properly if you refuse cookies. For example,
        without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized news preferences.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Links to Other Sites</b></p>
        <p>Users should be aware that when you are on GO Network, you could be directed to other
        sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from GO Network pages
        that take you outside our service. For example, if you "click" on a banner
        advertisement or a GO Network search result, the "click" takes you off the GO
        Network site. This includes links from advertisers, Center sponsors and partners that may
        use GO Network’s logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send
        their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. Always be aware
        of where you end up!</p>
        <p>Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online --- for
        example, via message boards or chat --- that information can be collected and used by
        people you don’t know. While GO Network strives to protect its user’s personal
        information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose
        online and you do so at your own risk.</p>
        <p>GO Network's policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of
        the Internet, and therefore beyond GO Network's control, and is not to be applied in any
        manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. </p>
        <p>We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy at any time.
        Please check this page periodically for changes. </p>
