<br>


<p><b>The Internet, Privacy, and GO Network</b></p>

<p>The Internet contains a wealth of information, unfortunately, it may 
also contain personal details about you that you don't want everyone to 
know. For example, your real name (lots of people on the Internet use 
aliases, alter egos or nicknames), street address, phone number, or e-mail 
address. When you go online, sites you visit may be gathering information 
about you without your knowledge. At GO Network we strive to help our 
customers protect their privacy while using our services.</p>
<br>


<p><b>GO Network's Privacy Policy</b></p>

<p>GO Network's policy is to respect and protect the privacy 
of our users. This policy statement tells you how we collect information 
from you and how we use it. Using the Internet should be a fun experience 
and we want to help you make it so.</p>

<p>The information you provide for your personal GO Network account is 
shared among the GO Network sites as it is our goal to make your visits to 
our sites easy and enjoyable. However, be assured that GO Network will not 
disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent. 
GO Network may disclose user information in special cases when we have 
reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to 
identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing 
injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) 
GO Network's rights or property, other GO Network users, or anyone else 
that could be harmed by such activities. GO Network may disclose user 
information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>

<p>GO Network shares aggregate information about our users with 
advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For 
example, we will say GO Network's audience is x percent females and y 
percent males. This data is used to customize GO Network content and 
advertising to deliver a better experience for our users.</p>

<p>There are cases where GO Network may ask you for personal information 
such as your name, email address, and birth date. For example, we request 
personal information when you register for a GO Network account, for 
online shopping or transactions, or for services that require registration 
or subscription (for example fantasy sports). GO Network needs to collect 
this information for fulfilling prizes, tracking/verifying compliance with 
GO Network policies as well as federal, state and local laws and/or for 
editorial and feedback solicitation purposes.</p>

<p>In case you change your mind or some personal information may change 
(such as your zip code), we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, 
update or remove the personal data you give us. You can do this at the 
member information page or by contacting our Customer Support organization 
at <a target="new" href="mailto:memberservices@help.go.com">memberservices@help.go.com</a>.</p>
<br>


<p><b>Opting-Out</b></p>

<p>Information provided at the time of Registration or submission from a 
guest who is 13 years of age or over may be used for marketing and 
promotional purposes by GO Network and our affiliates or companies that 
have been prescreened by GO Network. To keep you in control of your 
personal information and the communications directed to you, we allow you 
to opt-out of the following services: sharing your information in our 
member directory, receiving communications from GO Network about new 
features or services, and receiving communications about offers from 
third-party companies that offer a product or service that we think would 
be of value to you. If a guest objects to such use for any reason, he/she 
may stop that use -- either by e-mail request to <a href="mailto:memberservices@help.go.com">memberservices@help.go.com</a> or by 
modifying his/her member information online.</p>

<p>Information provided when purchasing products from any of our online 
stores may be used for marketing and promotional purposes and is subject 
to the opt-out processes described on, or linked to, each order 
form.</p>
<br>


<p><b>Policies for Kids (Individuals Under 13 years of Age)</b></p>

<p>GO Network encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with 
their children and to participate in the activities offered on the sites. 
No information should be submitted to or posted at GO Network by guests 
under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, GO Network does not 
provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, 
to any third party for any purpose whatsoever from our guests under 13 
years of age. All registrants receive an e-mail confirming their 
Registration. In addition, when a guest under 13 registers, he/she is 
required to provide the e-mail address of his/her parent or guardian and 
that parent or guardian receives an e-mail alerting them to that 
Registration. The parent or guardian must validate the account, as 
described in the e-mail, in order for the potential member to use most GO 
Network interactive services. No information collected from guests under 
13 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purposes 
whatsoever, either inside or outside GO Network except as explicitly 
stated during registration for contests or promotions (and in that case, 
the information collected is used only for the specific contest or 
promotion).</p>

<p>Although guests under 13 years of age may be allowed to participate in 
some contests and promotions, if such a guest wins, notification and 
prizes are sent to the parents or guardians identified in the initial 
registration process. Publication of contest winners names, ages, or 
images for individuals under 13 require parental or guardian consent.</p>

<p>We do not allow guests under 13 years of age to be listed in our member 
directory or to receive direct marketing communications from GO Network or 
to be sent our third-party offers.</p>
<br>


<p><b>Policies for Teens (Individuals 13-17 Years of Age)</b></p>

<p>Teens are required to provide the e-mail address of a parent or 
guardian and a notification message is sent to the parent or guardian of 
all guests who are 13 to 17 years of age which identifies the information 
supplied at registration and allows the parent or guardian to be aware of 
and participate in the guest's online experience.</p>
<br>


<p><b>Use of IP Address</b></p>

<p>An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your 
computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers 
that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its 
IP address.</p>

<p>GO Network collects IP addresses for the purposes of system 
administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to 
audit the use of our site. When guests request pages from GO Network 
sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link 
IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a 
user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We 
can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is 
necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service 
or to protect our service, site, customers or others.</p>

<p>Some services within GO Network, such as certain message boards, may 
display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. 
Please review each service prior to use and only use those that disclose 
information you are comfortable with sharing.</p>
<br>


<p><b>Use of Cookies</b></p>
<p>What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site 
transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. 
Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while 
you're at our site. We never save passwords or credit card information in 
cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at 
most major Web sites.</p>

<p>By showing how and when guests use a site, cookies help us see which 
areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the 
site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. 
This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the 
information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our users 
needs.</p>

<p>GO Network has two primary uses for its cookies. First, we use them to 
specify unique preferences. For example, in GO Network's News Center, 
users can specify keywords across several news categories. This way you 
don't have to tell us over and over again about the kinds of news stories 
you want to see. Secondly, we use cookies to track user trends and 
patterns. This helps us better understand and improve areas of the GO 
Network service that our users find valuable. While both of these 
activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to GO Network always 
have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. 
Information from cookies is sometimes attached to messages sent to our 
Customer Service department.</p>

<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset 
your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being 
sent. However, note that some parts of the GO Network service will not 
function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For 
example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized news 
preferences or you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, 
entering contests, or playing games.</p>

<p>You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. GO Network does 
not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by 
third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.</p>
<br>


<p><b>Links to Other Sites</b></p>

<p>Users should be aware that when you are on GO Network, you could be 
directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to 
other sites from GO Network pages that take you outside our service. For 
example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement or an GO Network search 
result, the "click" takes you off the GO Network site. This includes links 
from advertisers, Center sponsors and partners that may use GO Network's 
logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their 
own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information 
online --- for example, via message boards or chat --- that information 
can be collected and used by people you don't know. While GO Network 
strives to protect its user's personal information and privacy, we cannot 
guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do 
so at your own risk.</p>

<p>GO Network's policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the 
operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond GO Network's control, and 
is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or 
governmental regulation.</p>
<br>


<p><b>Security</b></p>

<p>The importance of security for all personally identifiable information 
associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great 
care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to 
our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be 
guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your 
personal information, GO Network can't ensure or warrant the security of 
any information you transmit to us or from our online products or 
services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your 
transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our 
systems. When credit card information is transmitted we use industry 
standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.</p>

<p>Your GO Network Account is password protected so that only you can 
access it and view the member information relevant to the account. We 
recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. GO Network will 
never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email. 
Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your 
passwords and any account information.</p>

<p>Remember to sign out of your GO Network account and close your browser 
window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others 
cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your 
computer is accessible to others or if you share a computer with someone 
else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or internet 
café.</p><br>


<p><b>Your Acceptance of These Terms</b></p>

<p>By using this site, you signify your assent to the GO Network Privacy 
Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. 
Your continued use of the GO Network sites following the posting of 
changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.</p><br>

<br>This is a great place for both new 
and advanced Web users to find information on using the Internet 
wisely. 
<p>

<b>Go Network's Internet Safety Tips</b> 


</p><ol>

<li>Keep your passwords private, even from your best friend! Your 
online service will never ask for them, so neither should anyone 
else.

</li><li>Use only your member name and/or e-mail address when 
chatting or sending e-mail. Never give out personal information like 
your name, address, or phone number.

</li><li>Always delete unknown e-mail attachments before opening them. 
They can contain destructive viruses.

</li><li>Remember that nothing you write 
on the Web is completely private - including e-mail. So be careful 
and think about what you type and who you tell. 

</li><li>Not everyone 
is as nice, cute and funny as they may sound online. Never make 
plans to meet an online "friend" in person.
</li></ol>
