    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
        OLO ("Five Guys", "us" or "we") respects the privacy of visitors to our Sites and registrants of our Services. 
        This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any Personal 
        Information you submit to use through our Sites. Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given in the Five Guys User Agreement.
    </p>

    <p>
        Five Guys provides certain websites, including the websites available at the domain name http://gofiveguys.com (each, a "Site") and certain 
        services made available to registered users of the Sites ("Services"). By submitting any information through a Site or registering for any Services, 
        you acknowledge and agree that Five Guys may process (i.e., collect, use, etc.) your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. 
    </p>

    <p>
        You expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Data according to this Privacy Policy. Personal Data may be processed by Five Guys 
        in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent. 
    </p>

    <strong>THE TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong>

    <p>
        Five Guys collects Personal Information and Anonymous Information from you when you visit a Site, use the Services, and/or send us information or communications. 
        "Personal Information" means information that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, 
        as well as any information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing information. "Anonymous Information" means information that is not associated 
        with or linked to your Personal Information, including any feedback you may provide; Anonymous Information does not permit the identification of individual persons. We collect 
        and use Personal Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy Policy. 
    </p>

    <u>Personal Information You Provide to Us </u>

    <p>
        We may collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through your access and/or use of a Site, including your user name, password, billing name and address, 
        contact information such as phone numbers or e-mail addresses, and credit card information. 
    </p>

    <u>Personal Information Collected Via Technology </u>

    <p>
        As you access and/or use the Site and/or the Services, we may collect certain information, such as unique identifiers for your wireless communication device, your product purchase 
        preferences, and the locations from which you order the Products, and details involving the time, place, cost, number of items and other features of your orders. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition, to make the Sites more useful to you, we use technological means to collect Personal Information from you, including the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) you just 
        came from, the URL you go to next, your browser type, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. We may also use cookies to collect Personal Information from you about your use 
        of our Sites. You expressly consent to our use of cookies when you use our Sites. 
    </p>

    <p>
        An "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser 
        session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session. We track IP addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies 
        to analyze our web page flow. 
    </p>

    <p>
        "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a web site sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a web site. Five Guys may use both session cookies 
        (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive 
        experience on the Sites. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of the Site and 
        the Services may not work properly. 
    </p>

    <strong>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong> 

    <p>
        In general, we use your Personal Information to respond to your requests as submitted through the Services and to charge your credit card the cost and transaction fee associated 
        with the Products you request. In addition, we may use your Personal Information to determine your purchase preferences, to better understand how the Sites and Services are used; 
        to gauge traffic patterns and determine what types of content and services are most popular with users; and to contact you with information about Five Guys's products, services, 
        news and events. We will share your Personal Information with third parties to fulfill your requests for Products, and we may share your Personal Information with third parties who 
        perform services for us or on our behalf. You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Information with these third parties. 
    </p>

    <p>
        We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you. We may 
        use this Anonymous Information to analyze request patterns and usage patterns so that we may enhance our products and services. Five Guys reserves the right to use and disclose 
        Anonymous Information to third parties in its discretion. 
    </p>

    <p>
        We may also use your Personal Information to send information on products, services, special offers, and promotions. Out of respect for your privacy, we give you the option not to 
        receive these types of communications. If you would like to cease receiving any such communications, you may unsubscribe by sending an email to support@olo.com. You may not opt out 
        of non-promotional communications from Five Guys, including confirmation messages regarding successful order requests. 
    </p>

    <p>
        We may share some or all of your Personal Information with “affiliates” (parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control), in which case we will 
        require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us 
        and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. 
    </p>

    <p>
        We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary (a) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on 
        Five Guys; or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of Five Guys or users of our website. 
    </p>

    <u>Feedback</u>

    <p>
        If you provide feedback on any of our products or services to us, we may use such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. 
        Five Guys will collect any information contained in such communication and will treat the Personal Information in such communication in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 
    </p>

    <u>Regarding Children</u>

    <p>
        We do not intentionally gather Personal Information about visitors who are under the age of 13. Furthermore, we do not intentionally allow visitors under the age of 18 to register for the Services. 
    </p>

    <u>Links to Other Sites </u>

        apply to these outside websites.

        in a controlled facility. Except as provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Five Guys limits access to Personal Information in electronic databases to those persons 
        (including employees and contractors) in Five Guys's organization who have a business need for such access. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Even though Five Guys has taken significant steps to ensure that your Personal Information is not intercepted, accessed, used, or disclosed by unauthorized persons, you should 
        know that Five Guys cannot eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information.
