                            <p>We also use cookies for analytics purposes in order to operate, maintain, and improve our Services (“Analytical cookies”). Some of the Analytical cookies used are set by us, and some are set by third parties such as Google Analytics, to collect and process certain analytics data on our behalf.

the Platform from. As we adopt additional technologies, we may gather additional information through other methods. We will notify you of such changes as described in the “Changes to GoFundMe's Privacy Policy” section below.) </p>

                            <p>Most web and mobile device browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org, which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browsers or mobile devices.</p>
                            <p>You can also consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies" target="_blank">Internet Explorer</a>; <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>; <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Cookies#Firefox" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a>; or <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/PH5042" target="_blank">Apple Safari</a>).

                            <p><strong>Web beacons:</strong> A web beacon is a transparent image file. Web beacons enable the Platform to track website usage information, such as the number of times a given web page has been viewed. Web beacons are invisible to you and (unlike cookies) are not placed on your computer. We may use them in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with the pages and content on the pages of the Platform. We may also use web beacons to track whether you have opened an HTML email. When the email is opened, a part of the code that makes up the HTML page calls a web server to load the web beacon that then generates a record showing that the email has been viewed. Web beacons may also recognize when the
email was opened, how many times it was forwarded and which URLs (links within the email) were clicked.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pixel Tags:</strong> In addition, we may use pixel tags (also referred to as clear gifs or web bugs). Pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track online movements of our users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel tags also
allow us to send email messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether emails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information gathered by pixel tags to information that is intended to identify our users.</p>

                <p><strong>Information From Social Networking Services</strong></p>
                <p>One of the special features of the Services is that it allows you to enable or log into the Services via various social networking services like Facebook or Twitter ("Social Networking Service(s)"). By directly integrating these services, we aim to make your online experiences richer and more personalized. To take advantage of this feature, we will ask you to provide your credentials for the applicable Social Networking Service in order to log in to our Services. When you add a Social Networking Services account to the Services or log into the Services using your Social Networking Services account, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Services to access that Social Networking Service. As part of such integration, the Social Networking Service will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to the Social Networking Service (for example, your name and photograph, as well as other information that you permit the Social Networking Service to share with us).</p>
                <p> We will use, store, and disclose such information in accordance with this Policy.

                <p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong></p>
                <p>As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, similar event, or steps taken in anticipation of such events (e.g., due diligence in a transaction), user information may be part of the transferred assets.</p>

                <p><strong>Agents, Consultants, Vendors and Related Third Parties:</strong></p>
                <p>GoFundMe sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions on GoFundMe's behalf, and we provide access to or share your information with these companies so they can perform services for us. Examples of such functions include marketing, mailing information, data storage, security, fraud prevention, payment processing, legal services, and maintaining databases. For example, if you are a donor in Australia, GoFundMe’s Australian entity, GoFundMe Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 627 702 630) contracts with Adyen Australia for payment processing.  Adyen Australia, therefore, will collect, process and store your information on
behalf of GoFundMe. We limit the personal information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and we require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information.</p>

                <p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong></p>
                <p>GoFundMe can access, disclose, transfer and preserve your information when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary    to: (i) comply with the law including with subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, and other legal process; and respond to inquiries or requests from government, regulatory, law enforcement, public authorities, or content protection organizations; (ii) protect and defend the legal rights, privacy, safety or property of GoFundMe, its affiliates, subsidiaries, employees, agents, contractors, or its users; (iii) permit us to pursue available remedies, commence, participate in, or defend litigation, or limit the damages we may sustain; or (iv) enforce this Policy or any applicable Terms of Service.</p>

                <p>We share your information with campaign organizers and, if not the same, the beneficiaries of the campaign. For example, if you donate to a fundraising campaign for a charity and, we share your name, email address and other information you’ve provided in connection with your donation with the campaign organizer or beneficiary, who may contact you. For example, if an individual starts a campaign for a charity and you donate to that campaign, the campaign organizer (individual) and the beneficiary (charity) will receive your information. On the GoFundMe Platform, the information is provided if requested. On the GFM Charity Platform, the information is accessible to the charity through the GFM Charity Platform records center. In the same scenario, beneficiary may communicate with you about your donation and/or may rely on your information in order to comply with its legal and auditing requirements.</p>
