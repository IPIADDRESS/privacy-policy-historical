I am telling you all this because I have wasted lot of time doing all this before

<h3><a href="http://forums.freelanceworkexchange.com/showthread.php?t=163#post1151" target="blank">[Full vs. Part-Time]</a></h3>
[QUOTE=nangel78;1151]I freelance part time. I have done it off and on over the years. I decided to part from graduate school so I am going to spend more time on the writing once my classes wrap up in December.[/QUOTE]

I am hoping to migrate to writing full time over the next few years.  In the interim, I have been paying off bills right and left.  My rationale is that in time I can swap the job roles - that is, go from a full time desk job and writing on the side to picking up a part time job outside the home and then spend most of my time writing from home.

[QUOTE=nangel78;1152]I am going to look into different avenues in looking for a freelance writing position. I am going to check out Writer's Market again, utilize people I know and apply via the net.[/QUOTE]

That might be good to revisit these older methods.  It has been a long time since I purchased a copy of Writer's Market - maybe I will let people know that it would make a good Christmas gift for me :D
