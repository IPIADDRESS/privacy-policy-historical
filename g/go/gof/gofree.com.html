                    <p>Aggregate Information We Collect<br>
                      When you use our Services, we may collect   tracking information such as your IP address, browser type, the type of   operating system you use, details about your computer hardware, the applications   you have installed on your PC, the domain name of your Internet service   provider, and pages you visited on our Sites. None of the information identifies   you personally and we do not link aggregate information to Personally   Identifiable Information.</p>
                    <p>Cookies. A cookie is a small text file sent to your browser. Cookies are   stored on your computer's hard drive for record keeping purposes. We and our   Partners use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID   cookie, once you close your browser, the cookie will terminate. A persistent   cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period. You can remove   persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s   help file.</p>
                    <p>We use cookies to: 1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account   information (stored on our computers). We also use cookies to store your zip   code and other information you have submitted for other services, such as   displaying your local weather; 2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser   accessing our Services is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine   the extent of repeat usage, usage by registered users and unregistered users,   and to help target advertisements based on user interests; 3) Allow our Partners   to track visits to their sites and stores. This information collected by cookies   is sometimes called "clickstream" or "click trail" and may also describe which   pages you have seen; 4) Measure certain traffic patterns, for example which of   our Sites you have visited. We use this information to understand our users'   habits so that we can make each new experience on a Site a better one. We may   also use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and   promotions that you will see. We do not store Personally Identifiable   Information in our cookies and we do not tie the information in our cookies to   our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
                    <p>Some of the Partner Offers on our Services may also use cookies. We have no   control over our partners’ privacy policies. We also have no control over their   cookies, the information collected and its use.</p>
                    <p>Web Beacons or Pixels. We and our Partners employ a software technology that   helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is   effective. Web beacons or Pixels are tiny graphics with a unique identifier,   similar in function to cookies. They track your online Web movement. In contrast   to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, we embed Pixels   invisibly on Web pages. They are about the size of the period at the end of this   sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixels to our customers’   Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
                    <p>Some of the Partner Offers may also use Pixels. We have no control over our   partners’ Pixels. We also have no control over how they use information   collected.</p>
                    <p>Global Unique Identifiers. A GUID (global unique identifier) is a randomly   generated alphanumeric identifier used to indicate a unique installation of our   Products or Services. We may create a GUID when you install our Products or   Services. We use GUIDs to track installations and to enable features and   functionality for specific customers who subscribe to our Products and Services.   We do not tie the information gathered by GUIDs to our customers’ Personally   Identifiable Information.</p>
                    <p>Software Information. We employ a technology that allows us to determine the   operating systems you are using and to view your computer’s registry. Software   installed on your computer has unique registry keys. By viewing your registry,   we are able to detect whether you have a compatible operating system, compatible   versions of DirectX, and Flash Player installed. We use your registry   information to determine whether our software offers are compatible with   software already present on your PC. We do not tie registry information gathered   to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
                    <p>Hardware Information. Your computer’s operating system also stores hardware   information that we examine to determine your computer’s hardware configuration   including the amount of memory and the type of video card your computer has, as   well as the speed of your processor. We use the information to determine whether   our software offers are compatible with your computer hardware. We do not tie   hardware information to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
                    <p><a id="a2" name="a2"><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></a><br>
                      Our   primary goal is to make our Services more useful to you. By knowing about you,   we are able to deliver relevant Services and Offers. We maintain a secure   database of all Information collected on our Sites and Services.</p>
                    <p>Research. We study users' demographics and interests using your information.   We also use cookies, pixels, software information and server log files to better   understand and serve you. We compile and analyze this information on an   aggregated basis. We may also share this aggregated data with current and   potential Partners.</p>
                    <p>Third Parties and Advertising. Third parties advertise on our Sites, and we   also contract with third parties to serve ads across the Internet. These third   parties may serve ads about our products or services, or third party products or   services in which, based on your Session Data, we or our business partners   believe you may be interested. These third parties may seek to use cookies and   pixel tags, including those collected on our Site, to track Session Data about   the ads you have seen and types of things in which you appear interested. These   third parties may also use combined information about your visits to our Site   and other sites in order to provide advertisements about related goods and   services that may be of interest to you. You can opt-out of the third party   advertising program by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative website   http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp. Opting out of a network   does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that   the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your   Web preferences and usage patterns.<br>
                      When you click on a third party   advertisers' link from our Site, you will be taken off of our Site and will   enter the third party's site. We are not responsible for such third party's   sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other site you   visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to that site,   and may be very different from our policy.</p>
                    <p><a id="a3" name="a3"><strong>Sharing Your Personal Information with   Partners.</strong></a><br>
                      The following describes some of the ways that we may   disclose your information to our Partners:</p>
                    <p>Search Partners. We may transmit your search queries (made on the Site or   within one of our Software Offers) to search Partners, who use this information   to provide us with search results, which we then will display to you.</p>
                    <p>Third-Party Advertisements and Software. When you request or submit your   information online to a Partner in response to any Offer, we may transfer your   information for each request made to that Partner. If we transfer your   Personally Identifiable Information, such information becomes subject to the   Partners’ privacy policy.</p>
                    <p>Our Products. We do not require you to provide Personally Identifiable   Information during the installation process. However, when you use any of our   Partners’ Software Offers you may be required to provide Personally Identifiable   Information. </p>
                    <p>Other Limited Circumstances. From time to time, we may validate the   information in our database by employing a validation service. In those   instances, we will disclose your information pursuant to confidentiality   agreements. In addition, we disclose aggregated user statistics (for example,   45% of our users are female) when we market to current and prospective Partners   and for other lawful purposes.</p>
                    <p>Legal Disclosure: We may also disclose account information in special cases   when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to   identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our   policies or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally   or unintentionally) our rights, property, users, or anyone else that could be   harmed by such activities. We may disclose or access account information when we   believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other   purposes that we deem necessary to maintain service, and improve our Products   and Services.</p>
                    <p>Sale, Merger or Asset Transfer. We may buy other businesses or their assets   or sell our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the   business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that we or all   of our assets are acquired, customer information, including any information   collected through the Sites or the Services would be one of the transferred   assets.</p>
                    <p><a id="a4" name="a4"><strong>Your Choices</strong></a><br>
