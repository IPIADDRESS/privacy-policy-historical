<p><b>Storage of Your Data</b><br></p>
We are a global organization and many of the computers and companies that process information about you by us or on our behalf are based outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). This means that the data that relates to youmay be transferred to, processed and held both inside and outside the EEA. Countries outside of the EEA may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA. However, if we transfer your information outside the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected in compliance with applicable data protection laws and this Privacy Policy. In the event that we transfer any data to AOL Inc. (our ultimate parent company), your data will be protected as AOL Inc. and its affiliates, adhere to the EU-US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe harbor Program.

<p><b>Children under 13</b><br></p>
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without parental consent. If we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information from our database. 
  

<p><b>Confidentiality and Security</b><br></p>
We limit access to personal information about you to employees or our partners who we believe reasonably need to have access to that information to provide services to you or to do their jobs. We have technical, physical and administrative procedures to help protect information about you from loss, misuse and alteration. However, no data transmission or storage can be 100% secure, and we cannot warrant the security of any such information. 


<p><b>Changes to the Privacy Policy</b><br></p>
We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time. Typically we will only do so if: we have got something wrong and need to correct it; the law has changed and we need to react to the change; we have changed our service and the changes need to be reflected in this Privacy Policy. Such changes will be reflected in this Privacy Policy and we will update the Published Date which will be the date in which the changes take effect.
