	<b>KEY BUYER POINTS</b>
</p><p>
IronPlanet is a marketplace for used heavy equipment that enables sellers to list and advertise their items for sale to a global audience of buyers.

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Bids placed through the Marketplace are binding towards the Seller and cannot be retracted.
</li><li>You, as the Buyer, are liable for all applicable taxes, duties, value added tax, and registration taxes unless the Seller indicates otherwise. If you are in the EU, in case of export supplies or (within the EU) intracommunity supplies, a zero VAT rate may apply provided that you provide Seller with the required documentation as indicated by Seller or IronPlanet on behalf of Seller (e.g., CMR-transport documentation, Bills of Lading, export documents, etc.). This documentation needs to be provided by you to IronPlanet on behalf of Seller no later than five (5) business days after Equipment is delivered.
</li><li>You shall pay a Transaction Fee for each piece of Equipment that is purchased from Seller while using IronPlanet's Marketplace.
</li><li>You shall remit full payment for purchased Equipment and other amounts including, applicable taxes, duties, VAT, Impuesto al Valor Agregado tax ("IVA"), registration taxes and the Transaction Fee within three (3) business days after the conclusion of the Binding Obligation. You shall include a transportation selection in your account prior to paying for the Equipment.
</li><li>You agree to remove the Equipment no later than eight (8) business days after availability of the Item Release. Failure to do so may result in relocation and/or further storage of the item at your expense. Further, if you fail to remove the Equipment after sixty (60) days, the Equipment may be deemed abandoned and disposed of as IronPlanet may determine in its sole discretion.
</li><li>Delivery of the Equipment will take place from the Seller's premises and you are responsible for all title, registration, freight and transportation costs. EXW Ex Works (named place of delivery, Incoterms® 2010).
</li><li>Dispute Claims under the IronClad Assurance® inspection certification must be submitted in writing within the Eligible Dispute Period and within twenty-four (24) hours of delivery. IronPlanet's IronClad Assurance Policy is located at <a href="/pop/terms_page.jsp?id=6">http://ironplanet.com/main/ironclad.jsp</a> and is hereby incorporated by reference.
</li><li>A Default Fee shall be paid to IronPlanet if you default after conclusion of a Binding Obligation.
</li><li>For Buyers in the Middle East, you acknowledge that any actions undertaken by IronPlanet or an entity acting on its behalf (such as providing logistical support of collecting monies) are pursuant to and solely in order to facilitate the sale and purchase of the Equipment and enable smooth conclusion to the Binding Obligation between you and the Seller. IronPlanet does not conduct business or carry out any commercial activities in the Middle East, outside of the Jebel Ali Free Zone in the United Arab Emirates.

</p><p>
<b>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Services of RB GROUP</b>. Under the terms of this Agreement, RB Group offers you the use of the Marketplace, which functions as a platform on which Sellers can list and advertise Equipment for sale to potential Buyers. Each party is acting on its own behalf, and RB Group is not a party to the subsequent binding obligation to sell/buy the Equipment  that is entered into between a Seller and a Buyer. Nor does RB Group represent either party in the transaction that results from use of the Marketplace.
</p><p>
<b>2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sale of Government Equipment</b>. RB Group may administer the sale of usable surplus assets for the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency ("DLA") Disposition Services,

Surplus Terms and Conditions located at <a href="/pop/terms_page.jsp?id=7">Surplus Terms and Conditions</a> and incorporated herein by reference.  All Equipment subject to the Surplus Terms and Conditions shall be identified as such on the item page of the Equipment Listing.
</p><p>
<b>2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertisement Period</b>. For select listings, the period during which bids can be placed on Equipment shall be determined by the Seller. For all other listings, the period during which bids can be placed on Equipment shall be determined solely by RB Group.
</p><p>
<b>2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buyer Conduct</b>. Any deliberate attempt to artificially influence the sales price, directly or indirectly, by any user is prohibited, including bidding through a secondary account, agent or representative on Equipment that you may be selling, communicating with other Buyers or shill bidding.
</p><p>
<b>2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice to Marketplace Direct Bidders</b>. Where a listing permits inspection of the Equipment, you should inspect the Equipment prior to bidding. Items offered for sale via Marketplace Direct are used and may contain defects. If you bid without having inspected the Equipment, you do so at your own risk. You or your agents are responsible for final verification of Equipment purchased at the time of removal.
</p><p>
<b>2.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binding Offer to Purchase</b>. You acknowledge and agree that bidding on the Marketplace is the legal equivalent of a firm commitment and an irrevocable offer to purchase. Unless the transaction is prohibited by law or regulation or the Buyer Terms, once placed a bid may not be retracted and you are obligated to complete the transaction as follows:
</p><ul>
    <li><u>Online Auction</u> - If you are the highest bidder and have met or exceeded the applicable opening bid at close of the auction.</li>
    <li><u>Buy Now</u> - If you elect to purchase Equipment by clicking the "Buy Now" icon on the Equipment page.</li>

Otherwise, your obligation to complete the transaction will expire two (2) business days after it was submitted or upon acceptance of another bid by the Seller, whichever occurs first.</li>
	<li><u>Reserve</u> - (a) If you are the highest bidder and your bid meets or exceeds the minimum price as established by the Seller ("Reserve Price") at the close of the Reserve Period noted on the Reserve listing ("Reserve Period"), (b) If the Reserve Price is not met, you submit a bid on the Equipment and, upon closing of the Reserve Period, (i) the Seller accepts that bid, or (ii) the Seller proposes a counter offer and you accept.</li>
</ul>
<p></p><p>
<b>2.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Declining and Countering Bids</b>. For Make Offer listings, you may submit a bid for less than the Asking Price. The Seller has the option, but not the obligation, to accept, decline or counter each bid submitted. In the event that the Seller counters your bid ("Counter Offer"), you have up to two (2) business days to accept. Counter Offers may be automatically rescinded earlier than two (2) business days when (a) the Seller issues another Counter Offer; or (b) the Seller accepts another bid, but in no event shall a Counter Offer be rescinded after it is accepted by you.
</p><p>
<b>2.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winning Bids</b>. RB Group is the final judge for the determination of winning bids ("Final Sale Price" or "Final Selling Price").

Before RB Group can establish the winning bid for Make Offer listings, (a) your bid must meet or exceed the Asking Price; (b) your bid must be accepted by the Seller; or (c) you must receive and accept a Counter Offer. Before RB Group can establish the winning bid for Reserve listings, the Reserve Period must have ended and (a) your bid must meet or exceed the Reserve Price; or (b) your bid must be accepted by the Seller; or (c) you must receive and accept a Counter Offer. After the winning bid is established, by RB Group, or you have committed to purchase the Equipment at the Buy Now Price, the bid or purchase commitment of Buyer will be automatically accepted by Seller and a binding obligation to purchase and sell between Buyer and Seller is automatically created ("Binding Obligation"). All applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to the Binding Obligation. You and Seller will be notified of the conclusion of the Binding Obligation by an email or other notification that is generated automatically by the Marketplace. RB Group DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT BIDS PLACED ON THE MARKETPLACE WILL BE RECEIVED AND PROCESSED IN A TIMELY MANNER.
</p><p>
<b>2.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voiding Bids</b>. RB Group reserves the right to reject or void bids, whether winning or not, which it believes (a) have not been made in good faith, (b) are intended to manipulate the listing process or (c) are prohibited by any applicable law or regulation.
</p><p>

After ten (10) business days, you will need to submit any refund request directly to the state for which the original sales tax was collected and remitted by RB Group. In the event your credit card is charged for taxes on a purchase that is subsequently exempted from such tax, the amount shall be refunded to your credit card used in the purchase. You shall indemnify RB Group against any tax, cost or expense if you fail to provide RB Group with a valid exemption certificate or other supporting documents necessary to calculate tax in relation to a transaction. You acknowledge and undertake to make yourself aware of and comply with all laws that may be applicable to your access and use of the Marketplace, and your entering into a transaction on the Marketplace. RB Group disclaims any and all liability in respect of your use of the Marketplace and your purchase of any Equipment resulting in any taxes (whether direct, indirect, local or federal), fines or penalties being levied on you. For the avoidance of doubt, it is your responsibility to satisfy yourself of any charges, taxes (whether direct, indirect, local or federal) or related obligations becoming applicable in respect of the transactions that you enter into on the Marketplace. You shall indemnify RB Group and its affiliates (and the officers, directors, agents and employees thereof) against any tax, cost or expense arising from your failure to satisfy any laws or regulations in relation to a transaction.
</p><p>
<b>3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VAT</b>. This section shall only apply to Binding Obligations concluded through IronPlanet Limited or IronPlanet UK Limited. All bids and offers are net of any VAT and other indirect taxes imposed with respect to the sale or purchase transaction. You are liable for all such taxes for all purchases. Accordingly, the amount of the successful bid in respect of any item of Equipment shall be exclusive of VAT and other indirect taxes, and the price payable by you shall be increased by such taxes (e.g., VAT) chargeable in respect of the supply of the Equipment to you. Similarly, all fees and other amounts payable to RB Group are calculated without regard to VAT so the amount payable by you shall be increased by the amount of VAT which may be chargeable in respect of the relevant supply. The amount payable shall be subject to VAT if you, as Buyer, fail to provide necessary documentation to Seller to substantiate a VAT rate other than the standard VAT rate (e.g., 0% export rate or 0% rate for intracommunity Supplies within the EU). You shall enter your VAT registration number upon becoming a registered user of RB Group's platform and shall immediately notify RB Group if that number ceases to be valid for any reason. You shall indemnify RB Group and its Affiliates (and the officers, directors, agents and employees thereof) against any tax, cost or expense relating to your and/or Seller's failure to satisfy any VAT chargeable in relation to a transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, it is your responsibility to satisfy yourself that any VAT (or similar) charges or related obligations have been met in relation to a transaction. For the purposes of these Terms, "VAT" means value added tax as provided for in the EU VAT Directive 2006/112/EEC or similar tax in countries outside the EU.
</p><p>
<b>3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment Authorization</b>. In order to establish bidding privileges on the Site, you understand and agree that RB Group, through its third-party payment processor, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to request a Zero Dollar Value authorization check on your credit card as part of verifying your identity. In connection with your purchase, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address, credit card information, or routing and account numbers for payments by electronic funds transfer either to RB Group or its third-party payment processor(s). You agree to pay RB Group for any purchases made in connection with your account in accordance with these Buyer Terms by credit card or electronic funds transfer. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided or by processing an electronic funds transfer utilizing the routing and account number provided, either directly by RB Group or indirectly, via a third-party online payment processor. If you are directed to RB Group's third-party payment processor(s), you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party's service and that third party's personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services.

These documents may include a power of attorney that authorizes a forwarding agent to complete the necessary Shipper Export Declaration (SED) and filing the Automated Export System (AES) record. For a fee, RB Group can provide equipment invoices or a notarized Bill of Sale to facilitate exports. RB Group cannot provide Manufacturing Statements of Origin (MSO's) on used equipment bought on the Marketplace nor can RB Group be held responsible for lack of manufacturers' identifying numbers or engine or serial numbers.

<b>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO ONLY ONLINE MARKETPLACES</u>
</b></p><b>
<p>
Unless otherwise noted in your Agreement, the below terms and conditions will apply to all sales of equipment through a Marketplace. All references to "Equipment" in this Section C shall refer to equipment that the seller is listing for sale through a Marketplace.
</p>
<p>
<b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RB Group's Services</b>.<br>
<b>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Services of RB Group</b>.Under the terms of this Agreement, RB Group offers you the use of the applicable Marketplace, which functions as a platform on which you can list and advertise Equipment for sale to potential buyers. Each party is acting on its own behalf, and RB Group is not a party to the subsequent binding obligation to sell/buy the Equipment that is entered into between you and the Buyer. Nor does RB Group represent either party in the transaction that results from use of the Marketplaces. In consideration of your use of the Marketplace for the listing and advertising of Equipment for sale, fees as listed in Section D are payable by you.<br>
<b>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listing Formats</b>.There are five listing formats available on the Marketplace:<br>
<b>1.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Online Auctions</b>.A service where you are able to list and advertise Equipment for sale to the highest bidder who meets or exceeds the opening bid.<br>
<b>1.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy Now</b>.A service where you are able to list and advertise Equipment at a Buy Now Price.<br>
<b>1.2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make Offer</b>.A service where you are able to list and advertise Equipment for sale to a bidder at the Asking Price or a Negotiated Price.<br>
<b>1.2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketplace Direct</b>.A service where you are able to self-list, advertise and manage the sale of business and surplus assets.<br>
<b>1.2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserve</b>.A service where you are able to list and advertise Equipment for sale to the highest bidder in a reserved marketplace, where you set the Reserve Price.<br>
<b>1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commitment to Sell</b>.By entering into this Agreement for use of the Marketplace, you hereby extend an irrevocable offer to sell the Equipment, as applicable, (a) to a Buyer who is the highest bidder and who meets or exceeds the opening bid, the Reserve Price, or Asking Price, as applicable (b) to a Buyer who commits to purchase Equipment at the Buy Now Price; or (c) to a Buyer who commits to purchase Equipment at the Negotiated Price.<br>
<b>1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening Bid and Scheduling</b>.For Online Auctions, RB Group will set the opening bid for the Equipment and schedule the listing opening times. For Buy Now and Make Offer listings, RB Group will schedule the listing opening times and set the opening bid, if applicable; you will have the option of setting a buy now price ("<b>Buy Now Price</b>") or an asking Price ("<b>Asking Price</b>"), not to exceed 120% of estimated market value as determined by RB Group. You may lower the Asking Price during a listing period, but you may not add an Asking Price after the opening time. If you have selected to list the Equipment by Reserve, you will have the option of setting a reserve price, not to exceed 120% of estimated market value as determined by RB Group ("<b>Reserve Price</b>"). RB Group will determine the period of time that the Reserve listing is published to the website and is available for Buyers to submit bids (the "<b>Reserve Period</b>"). If, at the end of the Reserve Period, the Reserve Price has been met, the highest bid received from a Buyer will be automatically accepted. If the Reserve Price is not met during the Reserve Period, RB Group may elect to re-list the Equipment.  All Buy Now and Make Offer listings will be scheduled to run for up to 90 consecutive days, at the discretion of RB Group. The listing period may be extended at RB Group's sole discretion. In the event the Equipment remains unsold, whether on a Buy Now, Make Offer or Reserve listing, after 90 days, (a) the Equipment must be re-inspected and will incur a Re-Inspection Fee and you agree to reduce the Asking Price or Reserve Price, as applicable, by 20% to continue the listing; or (b) you may elect, without penalty, to remove the listing.<br>
<b>1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional Options</b>.For Make Offer listings and Reserve listings where the Reserve Price is not met, you have the option to (a) accept bids lower than the Asking Price or Reserve Price, as applicable; (b) counter bids lower than the Asking Price or Reserve Price, as applicable, with a higher offer ("<b>Counter Offer</b>"); or (c) reject bids lower than the Asking Price or Reserve Price, as applicable, at any time during a listing. Counter Offers are valid for up to two business days. However, only one Counter Offer can be valid at any time; the last Counter Offer you issue supersedes and invalidates any previous Counter Offers. Upon acceptance of the Counter Offer by the Buyer, the listing is closed and you are legally bound to complete the transaction.<br>
<b>1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion of Purchase; Bill of Sale</b>.After the winning bid for a piece of Equipment has been established by RB Group or the Buyer has committed to purchase the Equipment at the Buy Now Price or the Asking Price, the bid or purchase commitment of Buyer will be automatically accepted by you and a binding obligation to purchase and sell between you and Buyer is automatically created ("<b>Binding Obligation</b>"). All applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to the Binding Obligation. Further, for Make Offer listings, you may accept or counter an offer below the Asking Price. In the event that you accept an offer or the Buyer accepts your Counter Offer (the "<b>Negotiated Price</b>"), a Binding Obligation is created and all terms herein shall apply. Buyer and Seller will be notified of such Binding Obligation by an email or other notification that is generated automatically by the Marketplace. Subject to your receipt of payment for the Equipment, you, at your own expense, shall deliver a bill of sale, if applicable, and such other documentation as may be reasonably necessary to transfer title to the Equipment to Buyer. Unless otherwise agreed, the Equipment listing will only show your RB Group 'Seller ID", but not your formal identity, business name and/or address details. This information will only be provided to Buyer at the time a Binding Obligation is reached.<br>
<b>1.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Guarantee on Proceeds</b>.There is no guarantee as to the gross proceeds that may be realized from a listing on the Marketplace.<br>
<b>1.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipment Availability</b>.Subject to RB Group's receipt of full payment and Buyer's completion of any additional, required documents, you and the Buyer will be notified that the Equipment is available for pick-up via an email that is generated automatically by the Marketplace ("Item Release"). You agree to have the Equipment available for transportation, complete with ignition key, if applicable, to the Buyer no later than one business day after a Binding Obligation is created. If the Equipment is not available, you will be subject to pay a Post-Closing Delay Fee. Further, if you fail for any reason to release the Equipment to the Buyer after a Binding Obligation is created, you will be subject to a Seller Default Fee in addition to any other rights or remedies that RB Group or Buyer may have.<br>
<b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipment Listings</b>.You may not list goods that are illegal to use or possess under any applicable law, rule or regulation. RB Group reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (a) refuse to list any piece of Equipment at any time; (b) withdraw any Equipment listing from the Marketplace; (c) review and verify a listing's information and description; or (d) cancel any transaction that it deems to be suspicious or fraudulent and report it to applicable authorities. The information you provide during the Equipment listing process, combined with the Inspection Report, constitute the listing details for the Equipment (the "Listing Details"). You agree to fully, completely and accurately disclose to RB Group all information relating to the Equipment of which you are aware. Any information (including brand name or other indication of origin or manufacture) that you provide related to the Equipment must be complete and accurate, and you shall be responsible for any inaccuracies, errors or omissions. Equipment listings on the Marketplace may not include links to or a description of other items that you may have for sale outside of the Marketplace.<br>
<b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspections; Restrictions on Use</b>.<br>
<b>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipment Inspections</b>.For all requested inspections, you agree to permit RB Group and/or its authorized representatives to test and inspect each piece of Equipment at a time and place specified in the Agreement or as otherwise mutually agreed. RB Group shall produce an inspection report ("<b>Inspection Report</b>") for each piece of Equipment inspected by RB Group. RB Group inspections are solely for the purpose of reporting on the visible condition of the Equipment's major systems and attachments. RB Group inspections are NOT intended to detect latent or hidden defects or conditions that could only be found in connection with the physical dismantling of the Equipment or the use of diagnostic equipment or techniques. Your failure to properly maintain the Equipment from the date of inspection until its removal from your location by Buyer will void the inspection. If you alter or perform repairs or other maintenance to the Equipment after the inspection, another inspection will be required, and you will be subject to a Re-inspection Fee.<br>
<b>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ownership of Inspection Report</b>.The Inspection Report is the sole and exclusive property of RB Group. Except as expressly stated, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to grant to any other party, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, license rights, ownership rights or any other intellectual property rights in the Inspection Report. You cannot use the Inspection Report for any other purpose without the prior written approval from RB Group.<br>
<b>3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restrictions on Use of Equipment</b>.From the time you provide listing details to RB Group or an inspection is performed by RB Group until the Equipment is removed from its location by or on behalf of Buyer following creation of a Binding Obligation, you may not operate, lease, rent, modify or alter the Equipment. In addition to any other rights and remedies that RB Group may have, a breach of this provision prior to the creation of a Binding Obligation for the Equipment may result in either of the following: (a) RB Group may remove the Equipment from the Marketplace and charge you a Removal Charge; or (b) RB Group may continue with the listing in which case if the Equipment was inspected previously by RB Group, you must have the Equipment re-inspected and pay RB Group a Re-Inspection Fee. If the Equipment was not inspected, you must supply updated Listing Details to RB Group and pay RB Group an additional Listing Fee. In the event of a breach of this provision is determined by RB Group in its reasonable discretion and the Equipment has been sold through the Marketplace, the transaction is subject to cancellation and you will be charged a Seller Default Charge in addition to reimbursement of transportation and other costs incurred by Buyer.<br>
<b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosure and Payment of Liens</b>.You are responsible for making full disclosure to potential Buyers of all Encumbrances and third-party interests that may exist on or pertain to your Equipment. You will at your own cost and expense warrant and defend title to the Equipment on behalf of the Buyer, its successors and assigns, against the claims and demands of all persons. If required, you shall be responsible for the payment of any independent equipment appraisals and documentation fees required to release such liens. You acknowledge and agree, and hereby authorize, that RB Group may, in its discretion, discharge creditor claims or pay for such appraisals and documentation fees and deduct the amount from the proceeds due to you. If your net proceeds from the sale of Equipment listed on the Marketplace are insufficient to discharge creditor claims and costs associated with any appraisals and documentation fees on the Equipment, you are fully responsible for paying the outstanding debt balance immediately upon demand by RB Group.<br>
<b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment</b>.<br>
<b>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment of Proceeds</b>.Once a Binding Obligation is created between you and Buyer, RB Group will generate a third-party invoice that is issued to Buyer on your behalf. Buyer is responsible for paying you the purchase price for the Equipment upon creation of a Binding Obligation, and you hereby instruct RB Group to facilitate receipt of the purchase price. Further, you hereby grant RB Group the right, in its own name, to enforce your right to payment. You agree that no monies shall be payable to you until paid by the Buyer. Once received by RB Group, any monies due to you, net of any commissions and fees due RB Group as detailed in this Agreement, shall be disbursed within 15 business days after creation of a Binding Obligation. You hereby consent to RB Group's right to offset any other commissions and fees specified in this Agreement or that result from additional services requested by you, with any remainder to be paid within 15 business days following receipt of an invoice. You acknowledge that Buyers may fail to perform or pay on a timely basis and that RB Group shall not have any liability to you for any act or omission of Buyers.<br>
<b>5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxes</b>.You shall be responsible for the payment of any tax or duty that is your responsibility as a seller of the Equipment.<br>
<b>5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title Transfer Fees; Lien Search Fees</b>.For each unit of Equipment, unless otherwise specified, you will pay lien search fees, document administration fees and any other fee applicable as set out in RB Group's standard Fee Schedule detailed in Section D. Document administration fees will cover fees associated with title or registration documents.<br>
<b>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Options After Buyer Default</b>.If the Buyer fails to pay in accordance with the Binding Obligation, the Buyer is considered to be in default. In the event of a Buyer default, you may at your own risk and account rescind the offer to sell to the Buyer after which you may elect any one of the following options:<br>
<b>6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offer Equipment to Second Highest Bidder</b>.If there was more than one bidder for the defaulted Equipment, you may elect to offer the Equipment to the second highest bidder. If the second highest bidder accepts, a Binding Obligation for the Equipment will be concluded by the Marketplace, and you will receive proceeds based on that second bidder's highest bid, less any applicable commissions and fees payable to RB Group;<br>
<b>6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-list the Equipment</b>.You may elect to relist the Equipment in a subsequent online listing within 30 days of the Buyer default without incurring an additional Listing Fee. In such case, these Terms continue to apply; or<br>
<b>6.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdraw the Equipment</b>.You may elect, without penalty, to withdraw the Equipment from listing on the Marketplace.<br>
<b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal Disputes</b><br>
<b>7.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DISCLAIMER; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b>.TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE MARKETPLACE PROVIDED BY OR THROUGH RB GROUP IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL RB GROUP BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, COVER, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING LOSS OF REVENUE, PROFITS, OR BUSINESS, ANY LOSS OF GOODWILL OR REPUTATION, OR THE COSTS OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, EVEN IF RB GROUP OR AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE THEREOF HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES<br>
<b>7.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English Controlling Language</b>.All performance under this Agreement and the resolution of disputes shall be conducted in the English language. If a translation of this Agreement into any other language is required by law, the English version will prevail to the extent that there is any conflict or discrepancy between the English version and any translation. If this Agreement is provided to you in a language other than English, RB Group does so solely for your convenience.<br>
<b>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurisdiction Specific Clauses</b>.The following jurisdiction-specific additional terms and conditions will apply for Sellers listing assets on the Marketplace(s) in the country noted.<br>

			<td width="97%">For transactions concluded on the Marketplace through IronPlanet Limited, IronPlanet UK Limited, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers (ME) Limited, all bids and offers must be net of any VAT imposed with respect to the sale or purchase transaction. Buyers are liable for all such taxes for all purchases. The amount of the successful bid for Equipment shall be exclusive of VAT, and the price payable by the successful Buyer shall be increased by the VAT chargeable to Buyer for such Equipment. In addition, all commissions, fees and other amounts payable to RB Group arising pursuant to this Agreement are calculated without regard to VAT, and the amount payable by Buyer shall be increased by the relevant amount of VAT that may be chargeable. To list and advertise Equipment for sale on the Marketplace, even if you would otherwise be entitled to raise a VAT invoice addressed to Buyer for the purchase of Equipment, you agree not to raise such an invoice and instead to accept a VAT invoice raised promptly by RB Group on your behalf. The invoice will be issued to Buyer after you have reviewed and approved the invoice by means of an automated process. RB Group is acting as a payment processor only, and you are responsible for ensuring that the correct VAT rate is applied and any VAT that is due for the purchase of the Equipment is paid. You are required to enter your VAT registration number on becoming a registered user of the Marketplace, and you shall immediately notify RB Group if that number ceases to be valid for any reason. You shall indemnify RB Group and its affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees against any tax, cost or expense relating to your and/or Buyer's failure to satisfy any VAT chargeable in relation to a Purchase Contract. For the purposes of these Terms, "VAT" means value added tax as provided for in the EU VAT Directive 2006/112/EEC or similar tax in countries outside the EU.</td>

	<p>
  <span style="float:right;">Revised April 6, 2018</span>
	</p><h2>Surplus Terms and Conditions</h2>
	<p></p>
<p>
These Surplus Terms and Conditions pertain to the sale of usable surplus assets for the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency ("DLA") Disposition
Services, other agencies of the U.S. Government and their Contractors (collectively, the "U.S. Government") and other persons or organizations selling property consistent with our DLA Disposition Services offerings.
</p><p>
The Surplus Terms and Conditions were last revised on April 6, 2018.
</p><p>
<b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>END-USE CERTIFICATES (EUC) (DLA FORM-1822)</b></b>
</p><p>
IRONPLANET WILL NOT SELL ANY DEMIL F OR Q PROPERTY WITHOUT AN APPROVED END-USE CERTIFICATE. When an END-USE-CERTIFICATE (EUC) is required to complete the transaction, no property will be released or removed until all certificates are filed and the property has been cleared for release. There will be no exceptions or exclusions to this requirement. The edition of the EUC, DLA Form-1822, provided online is the ONLY valid form accepted for these sales events. Once it is determined that you are the high bidder, after the sale close date, the following deadlines apply: You will have seven business days from the sale closing date to submit a completed EUC. If revisions to the EUC are necessary, you will have an additional five business days to make revisions and submit an EUC capable of being accepted by IronPlanet or the DLA Office of Criminal Investigations Trade Security Control ("TSC") Office, whichever will be reviewing the EUC. Buyers who have not submitted an acceptable EUC (DLA Form-1822) within 12 business days will have their winning bids voided and liquidated damages assessed equal to the greater of 25% of the winning bid or thirty dollars ($30).
</p><p>
The requirement that the EUC be complete, correct and legible is your obligation. We do not control the amount of time required for approval or the final decision to allow or disallow the release of the property to the individuals completing and filing the EUC.
</p><p>
Prospective Buyers of property originating from the DLA Disposition Services or the U.S. Government are notified that property sold is subject to Demil Code changes as imposed by the DLA Disposition Services or the U.S. Government. If an item's Demil status changes to "F" or "Q", you agree to complete a DLA Form-1822 when informed of the change, and if requested by the U.S. Government. Buyers will be notified in writing, with an explanation of the sale/lot/item in question, and a copy of the End-Use Certificate will be provided for completion. This becomes a condition of sale.
</p><p>
Sales of DLA Disposition Services origin property for which EUCs have not been approved by TSC within 60 days of submission will be canceled by IronPlanet at our sole discretion without liquidated damages to the Buyer.
</p><p>
		<b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DESTINATION CONTROL STATEMENT </b>

    </p><p>IRONPLANET WILL REQUIRE A SIGNED DESTINATION CONTROL STATEMENT ACKNOWLEDGING THE BUYER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL EXPORT REGULATIONS AND DOCUMENTATION. When a Destination Control Statement is required to complete the transaction, no property will be released or removed until all certificates are filed and the property has been cleared for release. There will be no exceptions or exclusions to this requirement. The edition of the Destination Control Statement provided online is the ONLY valid form accepted for this sales event. Once it is determined that you are the high bidder, after the sale close date, you will be required to fill out and acknowledge the Destination Control Statement prior to checkout.
    </p><p>
<b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE PROPERTY</b>
</p><p>
The information and descriptions found in the advertising materials for specific auctions or sales events are not guaranteed. We neither assume responsibility nor make any warranty regarding the sale's contents. Condition codes, National Stock Numbers (NSN), Local Stock Numbers (LSN), and National Item Identification Numbers (NIIN) are provided as received from the DLA Disposition Services as assistance to our buyers. We do not guarantee the accuracy of this information. It is your responsibility to verify an asset's information and description, including, but not limited to, product condition, estimated weight, count, measure or other factors that determine the bid price. Information provided by us is not guaranteed and should not be considered as a substitute for your due diligence and physical inspection of the asset.
 </p><p>
<b>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demilitarization as a Condition of Sale ("DCS") Property</b>. Demilitarization as a Condition of Sale ("DCS") property are items that must be demilitarized pursuant to applicable Department of Defense regulations before title to the residue can pass to the Buyer. We will advise you of the demilitarization procedures for DCS property offered for sale on this website. Demilitarization will be effected by melting, popping, crushing, deforming, or otherwise mutilating the property so as to completely destroy its military purposes. The use of precision torch fixtures, saws, tools of any kind to minimize mutilation or demilitarization is forbidden. Buyers of DCS property are subject to surveillance and verification by the Department of Defense. Failure to perform the required demilitarization within 30 days of property removal may result in the Buyer being referred to the Defense Logistics Agency ("DLA") Office of Criminal Investigations ("DCIA") or other appropriate enforcement authorities, as well as the suspension of bidding privileges with us. You represent that only U.S. persons (U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents) will perform or have access to the demilitarization procedures communicated by IronPlanet.
</p><p>
<b>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shell Cases</b>.You agree that you are not purchasing any shell cases for military use. You agree that you will not, directly or indirectly, use or dispose of in any fashion the assets for military use. You agree that you will include this clause in its entirety in any later sale or transfer of title, or possession by you or your successor in title or interest. You agree that the assets will not be exported for military use and, if exported for any reason, a full disclosure of their origin by reference to our Equipment Listing will be made to the appropriate export licensing department or agency. Any asset you plan to export must be completely destroyed prior to exportation.
</p><p>
<b>3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical and Dental Assets</b>.If you buy medical and dental assets from us, you must complete the online Food and Drug Administration (FDA) form before the assets will be released. Submittal of this form is a one-time requirement and will remain valid for all future purchases. You must complete either section A or section B of the form (whichever applies). It is your responsibility to provide an updated FDA Certificate in the event of a status change (from "A" to "B" or "B" to "A"). The FDA form may be completed prior to bidding or after the sale is closed and notification is sent to you informing you of your successful bid on the asset. Payment will not be accepted nor will any medical or dental assets be released without the form. We decide what constitutes "medical" or "dental" assets. It is your responsibility to complete and submit the form. In the event the FDA form is not completed within the specified period of time (stated for the sale), we reserve the right to withdraw the objects from the sale and dispose of them at our discretion. Should this occur, we will assess as liquidated damages the greater amount of 25% of the winning bid, or $30. IRONPLANET does not review the form to ensure it is completed correctly, and our acceptance of the form does not guarantee that the completed form will be considered acceptable by the FDA. If you have questions about how the form should be completed, you should seek legal counsel.
</p><p>
<b>3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demil Code Changes; Return of Restricted Property</b>.  In the event that DLA Disposition Services changes a Demil Code or determines that an item offered for sale by IronPlanet may not be sold, or must be sold with restrictions, IronPlanet may withdraw the item from sale or place additional restrictions on the sale at any time prior to the removal of the item by the Buyer. The Buyer will be limited in remedy to a refund of the purchase price and cancellation of the sale.
</p><p>Items sold by us, which are subsequently changed to a Demil Code status determined to be restricted by DLA Disposition Services or the U.S. Government, must be returned by you to the nearest DLA Disposition Services facility or other U.S. Government facility (if not originating from DLA), and you will be reimbursed for the purchase price and any documented transportation costs incurred by you. If you have already transferred the property to another party, you agree to provide the name and contact information of that party to the Department of Defense or other federal government agency charged with the investigation of the transfer or recovery of the property. Your failure to cooperate in returning these items, providing contact information of transferees or completing and submitting End-Use Certificates upon any Demil Code change may constitute grounds for suspension of your account and prohibition from bidding in future IronPlanet or U.S. Government sales, and we reserve the right to suspend your participation without providing you any additional notice or warning.
</p><p>In the event that a Buyer is requested to return property subsequently determined by the DLA Disposition Services or the U.S. Government to be restricted, Buyer understands that any certification to IronPlanet regarding what has been returned will be forwarded to the Government and be the basis for determining any refund due the Buyer. If you falsely claim a refund for property you have not returned to DLA Disposition Services or the U.S. Government, you may be liable under the False Claims Act, 18 U.S.C. Â§287. Included with the request to return property, you will receive contact information for Fast Track Logistics, who will be responsible for returning the property to the Government at no cost to the Buyer.
</p><p>You agree to cooperate with DLA Disposition Services and the U.S. Government in the recovery of property that was sold to you, which is later determined to have been restricted, and understand that if you fail to do so you will be deemed by the DLA Disposition Services or the U.S. Government to be "uncooperative" and may be denied access to future sales events at the discretion of the DLA Disposition Services or the U.S. Government.
</p><p>
<b>3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazardous Components or Constituents</b>. According to the terms of our contract with the DLA Disposition Services, IronPlanet sells only useable electronic devices, including reparable devices. IronPlanet makes no warranties or representations regarding the electronic devices it sells. Any device which is damaged in transit or is found to be cracked, shattered or broken may subject the buyer to regulations pertaining to the handling, storage, transportation, re-sale or disposal of electronic waste. Buyers are encouraged to check with their local and state department of environmental services to determine what regulations, if any, might apply under these circumstances.  Further, certain property may have components, parts, constituents or ingredients that may be corrosive, reactive, ignitable or exhibit other hazardous or toxic properties. You are cautioned to use and ultimately dispose of any hazardous components or constituents according to all applicable local, national or international laws and regulations in a manner safe for the public and the environment.
</p><p>
Certain pieces of property may contain residual chemicals, friable asbestos, petroleum products and ozone depleting substances or other hazards. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for providing documentation or certification regarding the identification or status of these substances. Certain pieces of property have design features that may be hazardous if warning labels are not heeded.
</p><p>
<b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REMOVAL OF PROPERTY</b>
</p><p>
You understand and agree that the DLA Disposition Services reserves the right to withdraw any and all property offered for sale up to the time the property is removed. If this occurs, IronPlanet's liability is limited to return of the purchase price paid for the lot. IronPlanet has no liability for specific performance, incidental or consequential damages.
</p><p>
You are responsible for rigging, loading, securing and transporting purchased property, including all costs and risks associated with removal. Please note that IronPlanet does not package items prior to pickup. Buyers need to make arrangements for packing of purchased items with a packing and shipping store, or other suitable vendor.
</p><p>
Where IronPlanet indicates the property must be loaded by the Buyer, you must provide all material handling equipment and properly trained and certified operators to operate said equipment. Additionally, you must provide proof of adequate general liability insurance, and proof of worker's compensation insurance. IronPlanet and the DLA Disposition Services must be listed as additional insured on the general liability insurance. Your employees or agents are responsible for compliance with all federal, state, local and host installation (the military installation where the property is located) environmental, safety and health regulations while operating equipment on the site.
</p><p>
In the event IronPlanet/DLA Disposition Services extends the removal period to accommodate your needs, you understand and accept that any liability and risk of loss does not rest with IronPlanet or the DLA Disposition Services, but is at your own risk.
</p><p>
Buyer certifies that Buyer maintains the minimum legally required workers compensation insurance on any employees performing work for Buyer at any government facility.
</p><p>
You are responsible for any damages to property, including spills or releases of hazardous substances, which might occur during the removal process. Failure by you or your agent to clean up any releases or to repair any damages may result in your being banned from future participation in IronPlanet sales, and you may be reported to the appropriate authorities.
</p><p>
Either you or your agent will be required to sign for all material in the presence of an IronPlanet representative (unless otherwise approved by an authorized IronPlanet agent) prior to removing property.
</p><p>
<b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRANSFER OF TITLE</b>
</p><p>
<b>5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timing of Transfer of Title</b>. Unless property is being sold with a requirement for demilitarization or other destructive scrapping, title will transfer to you upon removal of the entire lot from the military installation or other location. Title to property that requires demilitarization as a condition of sale (DCS) or that requires some other form of destructive scrapping will not pass to you until the demilitarization or destructive scrapping has been completed and evidence of completion has been provided to us. Under no circumstances will title to any property pass to the Buyer until payment in full has been made to IronPlanet.
</p><p>
<b>5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer of Title to Vehicles</b>. If requested, IronPlanet will supply a SF97 to Buyers under the following conditions: The vehicle must have been sold in a "usable" property sale. There is a processing fee of $50, £50 or €50, depending on where the item is purchased, for EACH SF97 requested. Buyers that purchase items located in the United States and that request a state certificate of title or duplicate state certificate of title will be charged $50. In addition, IronPlanet will charge a document preparation fee of $100 for each state certificate of title or duplicate state certificate of title.Buyer must verify the following pertinent information required to complete a SF97:
</p><p>
        </p><ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>Trailers - VIN#, Year, Make, Model, Body Style, and Weight</li>
            <li>Vehicles - VIN#, Year, Make, Model, Body Style, Weight, MILEAGE, Number of engine cylinders and Fuel type</li>
    </ul>
 <p></p><p>
        (Any missing information will delay our processing of your request)
 </p><p>
        Complete the Request for SF97 available during the Checkout Process. You are solely responsible for researching state requirements for titling and registration in your state and determining if the documentation provided by us will be accepted by your state or local department of motor vehicles.
</p><p>
        We are not responsible for, nor liable for, any unauthorized use or operation of vehicles sold by us, for vehicles that are not legally registered with the state in which they are intended to be operated in, or for obtaining insurance and insuring vehicles that have been sold prior to any operation of the vehicle.
</p><p>
        You are solely responsible for obtaining any necessary state or local permits allowing you to move any vehicle from the location of the sale. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless for your failure to comply with the provisions of this section. Vehicles described as "residue" will be provided SF-97s and will not be issued any title documents.
 </p><p>
        Any inspections required in order to complete a title application must be done at your expense and under your supervision. Check with your state regarding the requirements for applying for title prior to placing a bid.
</p><p>
        Where an original SF97 was provided to the Buyer for a conveyance sold by IronPlanet, requests for duplicate SF97s will be considered by IronPlanet; however, IronPlanet has no obligation to provide duplicate documentation, and cannot guarantee that duplicate documentation will be made available. Where an original SF97 is provided to the customer for a conveyance sold by IronPlanet, at the time of transfer IronPlanet will assign the SF97 to customer via a Letter of Re-assignment.

			</p><h2>Abandonment Policy</h2>
		<p></p>

		<p>
			IronPlanet provides this Abandonment Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures with respect to its Marketplaces regarding Equipment that has not been removed by Buyers in a timely manner after availability of the Item Release. This Abandonment Policy only applies to Equipment sold on the Marketplace and does not apply to any Equipment sold through a Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers live auction event. All matters relating to abandonment are governed by the terms of this Abandonment Policy, and by the Buyer Terms and Conditions (located at http://www.ironplanet.com/pop/terms_page.jsp?noh1=yes&amp;kwtag=footer) governing the purchase of the Equipment. This policy applies to all Equipment sold on the Marketplace unless a more specific policy or contractual agreement has been established.
		</p>
		<p>
			IronPlanet may deem a Buyer's failure to claim and remove Equipment within sixty (60) calendar days following availability of the Item Release to be evidence of Buyer's intention to abandon the Buyer's Equipment.  In these instances, IronPlanet may take action that is adverse to Buyer's interest in the Equipment, including, but not limited to, steps to dispose of the Equipment on the Buyer's behalf.  Disposition of the Equipment may include a variety of approaches and IronPlanet will determine the appropriate disposition approach which may include:
		</p>
		<p>
			</p><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
				<li>
						Moving the item from its existing location and disposing of the item as IronPlanet deems appropriate; or
				</li>
				<li>
						Scrapping the item; or
				</li>
				<li>
						Advertising the item for sale on IronPlanet's Marketplace, whereby IronPlanet will remit the resale amount to the Buyer less IronPlanet's expenses, storage*, transportation and other costs, and a 20% administrative fee.
				</li>
			</ol>
		<p></p>
		<p>
			*If a Buyer has not removed the Equipment from its existing location within eight (8) business days after availability of the Item Release, the Buyer will be responsible for paying any and all storage fees levied on the Equipment.  The maximum storage fees allowed to be levied on Equipment sold through an IronPlanet Marketplace will be 25.00 (in the listing currency) per day, beginning on the 9th day after availability of the Item Release, with the total amount not to exceed 1,500.00 (in the listing currency).

			</p><h2>IronClad Assurance Policy</h2>
		<p></p>
		<p>
			IronPlanet provides this IronClad Assurance<sup>®</sup> Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding Equipment that has been inspected by IronPlanet and received the IronClad Assurance certification. All matters relating to IronClad Assurance are governed by the terms of this IronClad Assurance Policy, and by the Buyer Terms and Conditions (located at http://www.ironplanet.com/pop/terms_page.jsp?noh1=yes&amp;kwtag=footer) governing the purchase of the Equipment.
		</p>
		<p><br>
			<b>Description</b>. If indicated by an IronClad Assurance<sup>®</sup> inspection certification icon in an Equipment listing, a general condition inspection ("Inspection") of the Equipment was performed and an Inspection Report was generated that includes ratings, comments, and photos of the various components of the Equipment. IronPlanet Inspection Reports are solely for the purpose of reporting on the visible condition of the Equipment's major systems and attachments on the day of Inspection and do not include load testing or digging/lifting. IronPlanet Inspections are <u>NOT intended</u> to detect latent or hidden defects or conditions that could only be found by dismantling the Equipment or use of diagnostic equipment or techniques. In no event shall IronPlanet be liable for not identifying those or any other defects. The Inspection Report is the sole property of IronPlanet and is for your personal use only and may not be displayed, published, sold, reproduced, disseminated or otherwise distributed by you without the prior written approval from IronPlanet.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>IronClad Assurance</b>. Under the IronClad Assurance inspection certification program, if you discover that a piece of Equipment purchased by you is not substantially in the condition as represented in the Inspection Report and you are within the Eligible Dispute Period specified below, you may contact IronPlanet Customer Care and submit a written dispute ("Dispute Claim") to IronPlanet. To be considered, the Dispute Claim must be (a) in writing, (b) within the Eligible Dispute Period, (c) delivered to IronPlanet as specified herein, and (d) satisfy the Dispute Conditions below.
			A deductible in the amount of 750.00 in the listing currency will be applied to any settlement of a Dispute Claim.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Eligible Dispute Period</b>. For a Dispute Claim to be considered, without penalty, you must review the Equipment and submit a Dispute Claim prior to the <u>first</u> occurrence of any of the following:
		</p>
		<p>
			</p><ul>
				<li><b>Passage of Time</b> - Eleven (11) business days after the date of the sale.
				</li><li><b>Self-Transported Equipment</b> (e.g., vehicles or self-transported items) - At the time the Equipment leaves the point of pick-up at the Seller's location for Equipment. You are encouraged to examine the Equipment thoroughly prior to removing it from the location.
				</li><li><b>Transported via Common Carrier</b> - Equipment delivered to (a) the Buyer's designated location within the United States or Canada for Equipment sold from the United States or Canada or (b) to the Buyer's designated location within the European Union member states, Switzerland and Norway for Equipment sold from such countries, subject to Passage of Time provisions above.
				</li><li><b>Export</b> - At the time Equipment leaves relevant port of export, if the Equipment is to be delivered outside the country where the Equipment is located, subject to the Common Carrier provisions above for Equipment located in the United States and Canada.
				</li><li><b>Disassembly</b> - At the time you or your agent or representative begins disassembly of Equipment from its "as-inspected" configuration, including disassembly for transport.
			</li></ul>
		<p></p>
		<p>
			A Dispute Claim will be considered <b>subject to a penalty</b> (equal to 50% of the final dispute resolution value) if submitted after the first occurrence of any aforementioned period and prior to the twenty-first (21st) business day after the date of the sale.  You may elect to waive any resolution and resell the item through an IronPlanet auction at the cost of the deductible (Equipment must be located in a country IronPlanet is authorized to sell from and all Dispute Conditions listed below must be satisfied).
		</p>
		<p>
			Any Dispute Claim submitted after the twenty-first (21st) business day will not be considered, with or without penalty.  At the time of Export and/or Disassembly (as defined above) you forfeit your right to any unresolved Dispute Claim on the Equipment and any future Dispute Claim will not be considered with or without penalty (unless IronPlanet has provided their written consent).  You may elect to resell the item through an IronPlanet auction at the cost of the deductible (Equipment must be located in a country IronPlanet is authorized to sell from and Dispute Conditions listed below must be satisfied).
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Dispute Conditions</b>. Dispute Claims are subject to the following conditions:
		</p>
		<p>
			</p><ul>
				<li>Receipt of full payment of the Transaction Fee, the Final Selling Price, and any associated taxes.
				</li><li>Additional documents may be requested to process or verify a Dispute Claim.  All requested documents must be returned within two (2) business days from the date the initial request is sent from IronPlanet.  Requested documents returned after two (2) business days will be subject to delayed resolutions, late fees (not to exceed 750.00 in the listing currency), or potential denial of Dispute Claim.</li>
				<li>For export items, Dispute Claims must be initiated and settled prior to export.
				</li><li>Ownership of the Equipment shall not have been transferred to another buyer.
				</li><li>The Equipment must be available for immediate re-inspection by IronPlanet upon request.
				</li><li>Until a Dispute Claim is resolved, the Equipment may not be used, rented or leased and no changes to the condition of Equipment such as repairs or disassembly may be made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may move the Equipment around the lot, load/unload the Equipment, and operate the Equipment to verify the reported inspection condition after receipt of the Equipment; provided however that such operation does not result in the use of the Equipment for more than the lesser of (a) three (3) hours or (b) five (5) odometer miles from what is reported in the Inspection Report.
				</li><li>IronPlanet shall not be responsible for any incidental damage which does not negatively impact the standard operation of Equipment or substantially alter the value of Equipment.</li>
				<li>IronPlanet shall not be responsible for Dispute Claims filed due to changes in Equipment condition as a result of exposure to the elements, including damage that occurs during transportation. Without limitation, IronPlanet shall not be liable for failure of Electronic Control Modules for systems or components, electronic displays, or consumables (e.g. batteries, fluids, lights, belts, tires, brakes, bulbs, starters, alternators, Freon and filters).
				</li><li>Only substantial inaccuracies in the items reported in the Inspection Report are covered. In addition to items not discoverable on a general condition inspection, specific items that are not covered include (a) conditions that can be identified only through the operation of a machine on a job site or under load capacity (e.g., digging, pulling, lifting, etc.), (b) operating the machine through the full range of speeds required to evaluate all forward and reverse gears, (c) replacement or addition of attachments to the machine, (d) disassembly, (e) use of diagnostic or test equipment to evaluate characteristics such as engine compression, and (f) electrical systems, hydraulic systems, and leaks of any kind (including fluid and tires), and (g) cosmetic damage which does not impact the performance or standard operation of the Equipment.
				</li><li>IronPlanet makes every effort to accurately describe Equipment using common industry terms. However, Equipment and options and attachments can be known by different terms in different parts of the country. You must refer to the pictures contained in the Inspection Report to clarify your understanding of specific Equipment characteristics. IronPlanet is not responsible for any misinterpretation or oversight by you.
				</li><li>If available, model year, make, and model is taken directly from the data plate.  If not available, IronPlanet makes a good faith effort to find the model year, make, and model using widely accepted serial number guide reference material.  IronPlanet is not responsible for any conflicts in model year, make, and model from alternative sources in the marketplace.  IronPlanet is also not responsible for any conflicts in model year and year of manufacture within any make of equipment</li>
				<li>Conditions visible in any of the Inspection Report pictures (including the full-size image visible through zooming), even if these conditions are not specifically mentioned in the written narrative comments of the Inspection Report, are not covered.
				</li><li>Drivetrain operational tests are limited to low speed in a confined flat area without load.  Differential interlocks, full transmission shifting and functionality of all drive axles cannot be fully verified.  Inspector listens for abnormal noises, observes leaks and notes physical damage.</li>
				<li>IronPlanet shall not be responsible for Equipment operating manuals or keys.
        </li><li>IronPlanet makes no guarantees as to the actual hours/miles on Equipment.  IronPlanet can only report what can be visually observed.</li>
				<li>The estimated total cost to fix items pursuant to a valid Dispute Claim must exceed 750.00 in the listing currency, which amount shall be applied as a deductible to any settlement of a Dispute Claim.
				</li><li>Dispute Claims filed on equipment with a sale price lower than 750.00 in the listing currency will not be considered.</li>
			</ul>
		<p></p>
		<p>
			<b>Adjudication of Equipment and Dispute Claims</b>. IronPlanet shall be solely responsible for the review and adjudication of any Dispute Claims. All determinations made by IronPlanet shall be final. In the event of a refund to Buyer relating to a Dispute Claim, IronPlanet shall remit all funds in the manner in which Buyer submitted payment (i.e., wire transfer to Buyer's account or refund on Buyer's credit card).

RB Group will release the original title to the Buyer within fifteen (15) days of the Buyer being declared the winning bidder and after payment from the Buyer is received by RB Group. Not all transactions will result in a title transfer, and Buyers should review the Listing to determine whether a title transfer is applicable. In lieu of titles, certain transactions may result in the Seller providing a bill of sale to the Buyer. The Buyer is responsible for providing an executed document from the Buyer, executed by the Buyer and Seller, along with any other additional documentation which might be required, including, but not limited to, a fully executed equipment sales agreement and export documentation in order to obtain the bill of sale.

Invoices to Buyers may contain tax. When tax is due, Buyer is required to remit the stated tax. Failure to pay tax will result in Buyer being placed in default.
		</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>
			<b>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;BIDDING PROCEDURES FOR SALES ON THE SALVAGESALE MARKETPLACE.</b>The bidding procedures set forth below are the rules that govern the SalvageSale Marketplace. In addition, you are subject to the listing terms for any specific Listing on the SalvageSale Marketplace for which you submit bids. In case of any conflict between the listing terms of any specific items or lots and these SalvageSale Terms, the specific listing terms shall control.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Sale Formats.</b> RB Group has four offering formats on the SalvageSale Marketplace which are explained below:
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Sealed Bid.</b> Buyers submit bids for listed items prior to the set ending time for the sale. Buyers are provided their rank position for the offering and may enter subsequent bids that are higher than their current high bid. Bid amounts are not disclosed to other Buyers. For any completed sale, the final purchase price and winning Buyers are confidential and will not be publicly released on the SalvageSale Marketplace.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Make Offer.</b> Buyers bid on the Equipment and the bid is a binding offer to purchase the Equipment if (a) the bid meets or exceeds the minimum price as established by the Seller; (b) the bid is accepted by the Seller; or (c) the Seller proposes a counter offer and you accept. Otherwise, a Buyers obligation to complete the transaction will expire two (2) business days after it was submitted or upon acceptance of another bid by the Seller, whichever occurs first. There is no definitive closing time for the sale unless such a time is specified in the Listing. For any completed sale, the final purchase price and winning Buyers are confidential and will not be released to other parties.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy Now.</b> Buyers may purchase an item at a fixed price that is published with the Listing. For any completed sale, the Buy Now is disclosed, but the winning Buyer is confidential and will not be publicly released on the SalvageSale Marketplace.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Online Auction.</b> Buyers bid on the Equipment and the bid is a binding offer to purchase the Equipment if you are the highest bidder and have met or exceeded the applicable opening bid at close of the auction. For any completed sale, the winning bid is disclosed, but the winning Buyer is confidential and will not be publicly released on the SalvageSale Marketplace..
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;How Time Extension Works.</b> Sealed Bid, Make Offer and Online Auction Listings will have a bid extension interval function. This interval will vary and will be published in the Listing. Any market leading bid, or bid that matches the market leading bid, placed within the bid extension interval just before a Listing's scheduled ending time will cause the Listing's ending time to be extended. The new closing time will be established by adding the bid extension interval to the time of the market leading bid. There is no limit to the number of times a Listing may be extended in this situation. This feature is also known as "extended bidding", "dynamic close" and "overtime".
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;How Bid Selection Works.</b> Every Sealed Bid and Make Offer listing uses one of two possible bid selection methods. The bid selection method and process will be described in the Listing for each piece of Equipment. In each method, once a winning bid is selected, that Buyers will be emailed an invoice by RB Group within twenty-four (24) hours, at which time the Seller and winning Buyer are obligated to complete the transaction. These methods include:
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Seller Bid Select.</b> The Seller will select the winning bid after the conclusion of a Listing period, which may or may not be the highest bid, or may reject all bids. The amount of time allotted to the Seller to review and select or reject bids will usually be included in the lot terms.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Seller Bid Select with Asking Price.</b> With a Make Offer format, an asking price ("<b>Asking Price</b>") will be published to the Buyer. If a lot is listed with an Asking Price, the Seller is not obligated to sell for any bid received below that price. When the Asking Price has been met, the highest bid at close of the Listing period will automatically be selected by the Seller. If the Asking Price is not met the Seller reserves the right to select a winning bid, which may be lower than the Asking Price, or the Seller may reject all bids. The amount of time allotted to the Seller to review and select or reject bids will usually be included in the Listing.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes to a Listing.</b> Once a Listing has been made public, the Seller may not change the Listing without RB Group's approval. In very limited circumstances, RB Group may permit Sellers to add additional non-material descriptive information, such as pictures or text, or correct inaccuracies, which do not materially change the original listing. If material changes are needed to correct inaccuracies in a Listing, however, the Listing will be terminated and subsequently re-listed as appropriate.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Retractable Bids.</b> Bids are not retractable except in extraordinary circumstances such as when a clear typographical error is made. Buyers should carefully review their bids prior to submitting them. If a clear typographical error is made, the Buyer must immediately notify RB Group, via the Contact Us page or by phone. Notifications must be received no later than one hour after the erroneous bid is placed. RB Group reserves the right to approve or deny any bid retraction requests and retraction may result in default proceedings against the Buyer
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Binding Bids.</b> Bids made by Buyers on listed items are binding. At the end of a Listing period, if (a) Buyer is the highest bidder and has met or exceeded the applicable opening bid in an Online Auction or (b) a Buyer's bid is selected by the Seller in a Sealed Bid, Make Offer or Buy Now sale format, the winning Buyer is obligated to complete the transaction. Buyers agree that bidding for items listed for sale on the SalvageSale Marketplace is the legal equivalent of a firm purchase order. Buyers are obligated to complete transactions on all winning bids awarded to them. If a Seller chooses not to select a winner on any individual lot, Buyers are still obligated to complete transactions on all lots they were awarded.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.7&nbsp;&nbsp;Void Bids.</b> RB Group reserves the right to reject or void any bids which RB Group believes have not been made in good faith, are intended to manipulate the bidding process, or are prohibited either by applicable law or the listing terms for such Equipment.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.8&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology Malfunction.</b> If a technology malfunction materially affects the outcome of a Listing, RB Group reserves the right to void the Listing within 72 hours of the scheduled ending time.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.9&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Bidding and Listing Practices.</b> Sale price manipulation of any kind by users is strictly prohibited, including, without limitation, bidding through a secondary account or other party, by communicating with other Buyers, or by shill bidding. Buyers or Sellers who do not act in good faith or otherwise subvert the integrity of the SalvageSale Marketplace are subject to suspension or termination.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.10&nbsp;&nbsp;Collection of Statistics on Buyer Performance.</b> As part of RB Group's monitoring of the SalvageSale Marketplace, RB Group collects statistics on each Buyer's bidding activities to determine such Buyer's performance history on this and other RB Group affiliated websites. Such statistics may include the number of completed transactions by a Buyer, failures or late funding of the purchase price, and taking late delivery of purchased goods. RB Group reserves the right to allow Sellers to access such statistics collected on a Buyer who bids on a specific item. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.11&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-Qualified Buyer.</b> Sellers may choose to limit a designated Listing to pre-qualified Buyers who will be required to place a specified amount on deposit with RB Group. Prior to the sale start, Buyers may be required to pay this deposit amount to RB Group by credit card or other approved methods. Only pre-qualified Buyers will be allowed to place bids during the sale. At the end of the Listing period, if deposits were provided, RB Group will promptly cancel the deposit charge on the credit cards of the Buyers who were not selected or declared the winning bidder. If the winning Buyer for a Listing defaults by failing to pay the agreed purchase price and other fees, the deposit amount of such Buyer will be forfeited and the Seller may exercise such other rights and remedies as are available under applicable law. In the event of such default, to the extent that the Default Penalty described above exceeds the deposit amount, RB Group will be authorized to charge such excess amount on the defaulting Buyer's credit card.
