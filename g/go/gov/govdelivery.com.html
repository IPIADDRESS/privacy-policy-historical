			<p><strong>What is GovDelivery?</strong></p>

<p>GovDelivery is a hosted Web application that allows governments and other organizations to improve distribution of documents and information.</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>
<br>

<p><strong>What information does GovDelivery collect?&nbsp;&nbsp;How is that information used?</strong></p>

<p>GovDelivery only collects personally identifiable information about you 
to the extent you specifically provide it to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes, for example, the information you
provide when you register to receive subscriptions or notices related to a document provided by one
of the organizations that we have partnered with.</p>

<p><strong>Information you provide when using GovDelivery:</strong></p>

<p>We use this information you share with us: </p>
<ul>
<li>to provide the services you request,</li>
<li>to improve the content of the Web site, and</li>
<li>for announcements related to new content on the portion of the site you were using when you
provided the information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We never share information gathered through our clients with third parties for promotional purposes.</p>

<p>However, we grant select outside vendors limited and controlled access to this information.&nbsp;
These vendors do not use it for any purpose other than to enhance our ability to deliver services
to you and other customers and are bound to keep the information confidential.</p>

<p>In some cases, our client organizations using the GovDelivery service (such as governmental and public bodies) have ownership of the information and its privacy and use is subject
to that client organization's separate privacy policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also share this
information with outside parties as required by law.</p>

<p><strong>Other information about you</strong></p>

<p>In addition to information you provide (e-mail address, password, subscriptions, preferences), GovDelivery uses technology
that lets us know what type of browser you are using, the Web site from which you enter <i>GovDelivery</i>,
and which GovDelivery pages you view.&nbsp;&nbsp;This technology does not identify you personally — it
simply helps us compile statistics about our visitors and their use of the GovDelivery application.&nbsp;&nbsp;We use these
statistics and share them with third parties only to improve our Web site design and content and
in connection with marketing programs.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>Users browsing documents from one of our clients will receive a "session cookie" that is stored on
the user's computer only until they close the browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;The session cookie allows the server software
to keep the user logged in as they browse GovDelivery.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cookie is not shared with other
websites, does not track or store personal information, and expires as soon as the user closes the
browser.</p>


<p><strong>What if you do not wish to have your information stored by GovDelivery for any reason or purpose? </strong></p>

<p>If you have provided your information to GovDelivery for whatever reason and would prefer that
GovDelivery not store your information for any purpose, simply visit GovDelivery to
cancel your subscription and delete your profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also request removal from our database
by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:REMOVE@subscribersystem.com" onmouseover="window.status='E-mail REMOVE'; return true">REMOVE</a> stating your request.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will act promptly to honor your
request.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Children</strong></p>

<p>GovDelivery does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the
age of 13.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a child has provided GovDelivery with personally identifiable information, we ask
that a parent or guardian send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:GDsupport@subscribersystem.com" onmouseover="window.status='E-mail SUPPORT'; return true">SUPPORT</a> with the child's name and we will do
our best to delete the information from our files.</p>

<p><strong>Your Consent</strong></p>

<p>By using the GovDelivery Web site, you consent to our use of the information you provide to us as
described in this Online Privacy Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we implement new technology and introduce new services,
we will update our Online Privacy Policy, so we encourage you to review it often.</p>

<p><strong>EU Safe Harbor</strong></p>

<p>GovDelivery, Inc. abides by the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding
collection, use and retention of data from the European Union.</p>

<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>

<p><strong>Secure Sockets Layering (SSL)</strong></p>

<p>GovDelivery uses Secure Socket Layering (SSL) to encrypt you and your business' personal information,
including name, address and credit card number, before it travels over the Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;SSL technology
is the industry standard for secure online transactions. Because we use SSL, making a payment online
at GovDelivery is just as safe giving your credit card number over the phone.</p>

<p><strong>The law protects you, too</strong></p>

<p>Our security measures are designed to prevent anyone from stealing and using your credit card number.
In addition, consumer protection laws protect you against the unauthorized use of your credit card.
Under federal law, if someone steals your credit card or your credit card number, your liability is
limited to $50 no matter how much the thief charges to your account.</p>

<p><strong>Our Safe Shopping Guarantee</strong></p>

<p>When you use your credit card within GovDelivery, you are protected by our Safe Shopping Guarantee: If
your credit card information is stolen because you used your credit card to make an online payment
through GovDelivery, we'll make sure you don't have to pay any fraudulent charges made to your account.
Here's how it works:</p>

<p>If fraudulent charges are made to your credit card, you must notify your credit card company in
accordance with its rules and procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your credit card
company cannot make you pay more than $50 of the fraudulent charges.</p>

<p>If your credit card company makes you pay any part of this $50, then GovDelivery will reimburse you,
up to the full $50.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we will do so only if the unauthorized use of your credit card number
occurred because you used it to make a payment through GovDelivery and only if you properly notified
your credit card company.</p>
