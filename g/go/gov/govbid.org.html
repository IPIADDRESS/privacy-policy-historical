As soon as your <a href="/registration" class="red norm">Account Registration</a> process is complete and you have successfully set your payment wallet data you may go to “My Wallet” section of the profile, and by clicking at the DEPOSIT button which is located at the “Transactions” area of the page, choose a desirable payment method and specify a sum you would like to enroll your profile with.<br>You then will be redirected to the merchant gate, so in order to finish an operation it will be asked from you to send an exact amount required to complete your deposit.</p><br>
												<p> After performing all the necessary steps, where based on the merchant's technical specification, you may be redirected back to the G.B.P. account (E-Payment) or will complete an operation by waiting for at least <span class="red">3 confirmations</span> from the network (Blockchain-based transactions). </p><br>
												<p>Please be aware, that in order to successfully enroll your account with an available balance, you would always have to send an exact amount required by the merchant (including all the decimals) and to make sure our system will display your deposit in no time, we recommend you to allow a <span class="fb">maximum Transaction Fee</span> (for Bitcoin &amp; similar payments).  </p>

												<p>By clicking at the “Available Contracts” section of your profile, you will be able to explore all contracts with different metrics bound to them. Higher daily M.D.F. will allow you to gain more revenue, yet might take a longer cycle under the greater entrance bid, as by performing your bids on contracts with a short life-span, may create a rapid return of your bids. </p><br>
												<p>You soon will see, that despite the fact of many contracts to be available for bidding, each one of them is quite unique.  Having such a vast number of contracts in stock will expand your possibilities at creating an exclusive strategy which fits your needs as a venture backer in the first place.</p>
												<p>The expiration timer will define when exactly the contract is to be removed from the listing, thus all users may obtain their principal, in addition to the Margin Difference in a form of revenue. </p><br>
												<p>It should be noted, that to obtain a particular contract’s terms there might be a different sum of an entrance bid required to work with a given contract. Contracts with greater entrance bid may have some pretty bankable margin difference, yet typically with a cost to the expiration timer, which eventually may lead for longer waiting period prior to the final bids sell-off. 
Also, it is very important to understand, that when you bid at any given moment, <span class="red">contract's expiration timer will continuously define its key metrics</span>, resulting with a decreased M.D.F. if your bid hasn’t been placed <span class="blue3">within the first hours</span> of the lot's timer. Jumping in early on is the key of climbing to the peak of your bidding performance!</p>
