<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>References in this Privacy Policy to "we" or "us" refers to goviral and its group companies, including without limitation, AOL Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. References to "content" includes advertising. You agree that goviral may transfer your personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy to our group companies worldwide.</p>

<p>When you visit our sites ("Our Websites"), sites within the goviral network ("Network Websites"), or view a video distributed within the goviral player, we collect a variety of information about you and put it to different uses. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and how we use it. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through third parties in which we do not have any control. The use of data collected by such third parties will be subject to that third party's own Privacy Policy.</p>

<h4>Visitor Information</h4>

<p>When you visit Our Websites, Network Websites, or view a video distributed within the goviral player, we may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to anonymously track how you use our website and our player.

<p>Further, our web sites and video player may include advertising provided by advertising networks that are not part of our group companies. Such advertising networks may also use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to gain information about you and serve you with targeted ads. In such cases, the third party advertising network's privacy policy will apply to the data collected by such third party and not this one. We work with our group company, AOL, who may set cookies on your browser in order to re-target you (or, your browser) with display advertising which is directly relevant to goviral video advertising which you may have viewed. <a href="http://help.aol.co.uk/help_uk/documentLink.do?cmd=displayKC&amp;docType=kc&amp;externalId=uk_1180632794">You may opt out of AOL cookies here</a>.</p>

<h4>Sharing Data with Third Parties</h4>

<p>Except as we explain in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose any information that personally identifies you to third parties unless you have consented to us doing so, except in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of us and have confidentiality agreements in place;</li>
    <li>If we are required to disclose the information pursuant to a subpoena, court order, legal process, or to any legitimate request by the authorities;</li>
    <li>We believe it is necessary to share this information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also use and sell the information we collect on you by putting it together with other information we collect on other users in such a manner that does not identify you. We do not sell nor rent any information that we have that identifies you personally.</p>

<h4>Storage of Your Data</h4>

<p>We are a global organization and many of the computers and companies that process information about you by us or on our behalf are based outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). This means that the data that relates to youmay be transferred to, processed and held both inside and outside the EEA. Countries outside of the EEA may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA. However, if we transfer your information outside the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected in compliance with applicable data protection laws and this Privacy Policy. In the event that we transfer any data to AOL Inc. (our ultimate parent company), your data will be protected as AOL Inc. and its affiliates, adhere to the EU-US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe harbor Program. <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">Click here for more information</a>.</p>

<h4>Children under 13</h4>

<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without parental consent. If we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information from our database.</p>

<h4>Confidentiality and Security</h4>

<p>We limit access to personal information about you to employees or our partners who we believe reasonably need to have access to that information to provide services to you or to do their jobs. We have technical, physical and administrative procedures to help protect information about you from loss, misuse and alteration. However, no data transmission or storage can be 100% secure, and we cannot warrant the security of any such information.</p>

<h4>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h4>

<p>We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time. Typically we will only do so if: we have got something wrong and need to correct it; the law has changed and we need to react to the change; we have changed our service and the changes need to be reflected in this Privacy Policy. Such changes will be reflected in this Privacy Policy and we will update the Published Date which will be the date in which the changes take effect.</p>
