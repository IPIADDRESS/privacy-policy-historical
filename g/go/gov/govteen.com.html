                to data collection or prior to transferring the data. Details of shared use can
                be found in specific Terms of Service or Use Agreements, and sweepstakes and
                promotions rules. Some or all data collected during a GOV promotion may be

                we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data. </font> </p> 
              <p><font face="Arial">Many promotions offer opportunities to
                request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information,
                you give GOV permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so
                they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will
                be shared. If more information will be shared with the sponsor, you will be

                parent or guardian establish a GOV Kid Account. The Kid Accounts feature allows
                GOV to obtain verifiable consent from a parent or guardian before we collect
                any registration information from a child we know to be under 13 years of age.
                In addition, Kid Accounts allow a parent to access their child's GOV Kid
                Account (member profile), edit personal information and better control their
                child's personal information. To learn more about GOV Kid Accounts, please see
