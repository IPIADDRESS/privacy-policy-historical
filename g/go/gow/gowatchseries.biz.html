In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services.</p> <p class="bold">Enforcement</p> <p>gowatchseries.to regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy.
