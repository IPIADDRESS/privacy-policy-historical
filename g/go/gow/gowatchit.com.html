    <p>EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 23, 2017</p>

<p>This policy explains how Plexus Entertainment, LLC ("Plexus," "we," "us" or "our") collects, uses and shares information about you to customize your experiences on our digital properties and elsewhere and for other purposes relating to our business. These activities are powered by data collected, used and shared on Plexusâ€™ website located at www.gowatchit.com and GoWatchIt Apps, and also on <a href="#microsites">Microsites</a>, <a href="#third-party-sites">Third-Party Sites</a> and elsewhere, as described herein (wherever you encounter GoWatchIt functionality collectively, the "GoWatchIt Service").</p>

<p><strong>Where You May Encounter the GoWatchIt Service</strong></p>

<p>We may collect information about you and your activities by way of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A website at www.gowatchit.com, GoWatchIt-branded device and platform-specific applications ("Apps") and <a href="#notifications">Notifications</a> and other direct communications between us or a <a href="#gowatchit-partner">GoWatchIt Partner</a> and you.</p></li>
<li><p><a name="microsites"></a>Standalone web destinations styled and configured by or on behalf of GoWatchIt Partners using GoWatchIt tools and offering GoWatchIt functionality ("Microsites"). Microsites are hosted by us and contain GoWatchIt attribution.</p></li>
<li><p><a name="third-party-sites"></a>Third-party properties incorporating GoWatchIt functionality, identified by GoWatchIt attribution or that contain GoWatchIt <a href="#pixels">pixels</a> for tracking purposes ("Third-Party Sites"). Third-Party Sites may include blogs, social media or Product-specific, industry-focused or general interest media properties or any destination with advertisements incorporating GoWatchIt functionality.</p></li>
<li><p>Links placed by GoWatchIt Partners in social media, advertisements, trailers / videos and other marketing activities which, when clicked, direct you to a specific webpage at www.gowatchit.com or a similar App destination, a Microsite, a Third-Party Site or directly to a retailer or other web destination via a redirect through GoWatchIt ("Inbound Links").</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>

<p>Personal Information ("PI") is information that can be used to identify an individual, including name, postal address, mobile phone number or e-mail address. You provide us with PI when you create a GoWatchIt <a href="#account">Account</a> and/or when you enter or edit information in your Account profile ("Profile"). If you create an Account through a social media service such as Facebook Connect or subsequently associate your Account with one or more social media or other accounts, we may receive your user name(s), e-mail address and/or other information depending on your account settings with the relevant <a href="#associated-services-link">Associated Service</a>. We may also receive certain PI about others when you create an Account or otherwise interact with the GoWatchIt Service, including names and email addresses of your contacts or friends. You may also give us your e-mail address or mobile phone number when you set alerts to receive Notifications regarding movies, TV shows or other products ("Products") in which you are interested or you follow <a href="#themed-lists">Themed Lists</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What Activity, Demographic &amp; Technical Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>

<p>Activity, Demographic &amp; Technical Information includes information that by itself does not identify an individual. For example, you may add your zip code, date of birth, gender, information regarding Products and services you favor and/or use or your other preferences or interests to your Profile, or we may receive such information via an Associated Service. We may also attribute the foregoing and other information to you based on your activities when you encounter the GoWatchIt Service, even if you are not an <a href="#account-user">Account User</a>. You should assume that any time you encounter the GoWatchIt Service, whether or not you interact with us, we obtain information about you and your activities and interests. This information may be collected from your device, browser or operating system (such as your IP address, device ID, location, operating system and browser type) and/or through the use of <a href="#cookies-beacons">cookies, web beacons and similar technologies</a>. We may also obtain additional information about you, including demographic information or device IDs, and your activities elsewhere from third-parties.</p>

<p>We may combine any or all of the PI and Activity, Demographic &amp; Technical Information (collectively "Information") we collect or otherwise obtain about you and use it in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>How We Use Information</strong></p>

<p>We may use Information for any purpose relating to our business, subject to this Privacy Policy. This includes, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Responding to your requests to provide you with Notifications and disseminating other direct communications to you. </p></li>

<li><p>For purposes as disclosed at the point of collection. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How We Share Information</strong></p>

<p>We may share Information with certain third parties in the following ways: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Processors and Service Providers</strong>: We may disclose Information to our contractors and certain other vendors or suppliers who process data on our behalf or assist us in the day to day operation of our services, including analytics vendors, e-mail and text messaging service providers and third-parties that help us manage and use Information collected via cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, including for use in interest-based advertising.</p></li>
<li><p></p><p><a name="gowatchit-partner"></a> <strong><em>GoWatchIt Partners:</em></strong> We may disclose Information to the parties responsible for the deployments of GoWatchIt functionality giving rise to such Information ("GoWatchIt Partners").

</ul>

<p>GoWatchIt Partners may include filmed content studios and distributors, as well as a broad range of other entities promoting various Products and services.</p>

We may also provide Information to GoWatchIt Partners and other third-parties for use in interest-based advertising.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Transfer of Assets</em></strong>: We may transfer Information as an asset in connection with a proposed or actual merger or sale (including any transfers made as part of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all or part of our business or as part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change in control. We may also use and disclose your Information to parties connected with the contemplated or actual financing, insuring, sale, assignment or other disposal of all or part of our business or assets, including for the purposes of determining whether to proceed or continue with such transaction or business relationship or fulfilling any records or other reporting requirements to such parties. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Your Consent:</em></strong> We may share Information with third-parties and others when you give us your consent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Other:</em></strong> Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose any Information about you (i) if required to do so by court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request; (ii) with respect to notices and counter-notices pursuant to our DMCA notice and takedown policy and procedures; (iii) if we believe that such action is necessary to enforce or apply our <a href="https://gowatchit.com/pages/terms">Terms of Use</a>; and/or (iv) to protect or defend the rights, property or safety of Plexus, our users or others. </p></li>

<p><a name="cookies-beacons"></a><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies</strong></p>

<p>We use a variety of technologies to learn more about how you use the Internet and the GoWatchIt Service as described below. We may use all of these technologies, or other similar technologies across the GoWatchIt Service.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A cookie</strong> is a small string of data sent by us that is stored in your computer's Internet browser and provided back to us each time you encounter the GoWatchIt Service to uniquely identify your browser. We may use session cookies, which are temporary cookies that disappear after you close your browser, and/or persistent cookies, which are reloaded when you open a new browser session. You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely. However, disabling cookies may make certain GoWatchIt functionality unavailable or suboptimal. Blocking cookies will not prevent the use of other technologies on your browser or device. </p></li>
<li><p><a name="pixels"></a><strong>A web beacon</strong>, also called a single-pixel (1x1), clear GIF or pixel tag, is an electronic image embedded in a webpage or HTML-based e-mail. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as a cookie number, time and date of a page view and the webpage where the beacon is placed. While you may not decline web beacons, you may render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies. But, like we said, if you disable the cookies associated with a beacon, some GoWatchIt functionality may not work properly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other similar technologies.</strong> We and our service providers, advertisers and other third-parties may use other kinds of technology such as local storage objects, including "flash cookies," authentication tokens and HTML5 local storage. Like cookies, these technologies are stored on your computer, albeit in different parts of your device, and perform similar functions. They can also be used to store certain information about your preferences. Your Internet browser may allow you to disable HTML5 or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage by changing your browser settings. Please note that disabling these technologies may interfere with the performance and features of the GoWatchIt Service.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="interest-based-advertising"></a><strong>Interest-Based Advertising and Choices</strong></p>

<p>Certain third-parties may engage in interest-based advertising ("IBA") via the GoWatchIt Service. IBA involves the collection of web viewing and application use data across this website and/or application and other non-affiliated websites and apps over time and across browsers and devices, and the use of such data, often along with other data, to infer consumer interests.&nbsp;These inferred interests are used to provide relevant advertising to you across various browsers and devices attributed to you. If you would like to learn more about interest-based advertising, or to opt-out of this practice from third-party companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Program for this browser, please visit the DAA Consumer Choice Page <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices">here</a>. To learn more about IBA on this device, download the AppChoices application, available for iOS and Android. To learn how to&nbsp;opt-out of having your information collected in mobile apps on this mobile device by third-party companies participating in AppChoices, please click <a href="http://www.youradchoices.com/appchoices">here</a>. </p>

<p>Additionally, Plexus adheres to the DAA's Self-Regulatory Principles. We also collect information about your activity across non-affiliated websites and applications, over time and across devices for IBA purposes. To opt-out of our collection, use and transfer of your information from this browser for interest-based advertising, please click <a href="https://gowatchit.com/pages/opt-out">here</a>. To opt-out of our collection, use and transfer of information about your mobile app usage history on this mobile device, you can choose to limit that activity through your mobile deviceâ€™s platform controls, such as "limit ad tracking." </p>

<p>If you delete cookies, reset your device identifier or use another browser or device, you may need to repeat your choices. If you opt out, you will still receive ads, but these ads may be less relevant to you. If you elect to opt out, we may still collect data for other purposes including analytics, reporting, content personalization and other business purposes. </p>

<p>To disable our collection of precise location information from your mobile device, you can access your mobile device settings and choose to limit that collection.</p>
