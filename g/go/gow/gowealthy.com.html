                      If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post 
                      those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and 
                      other places we deem appropriate so our users are always

                      under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will 
                      use information in accordance with the privacy policy under 
                      which the information was collected. If, however, we are

                      in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection 
                      we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice 
                      as to whether or not we use their information in this different 
                      manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication 
                      with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then 
                      they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information 
                      be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any 
                      material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect 
                      user information already stored in our database, we will 
                      post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users 
                      of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will 
                      also email users, who have opted to receive communications 
                      from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
