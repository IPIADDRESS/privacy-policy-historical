				<p>This privacy policy may be changed from time to time, so please check it on a regular basis.</p>
				<p>What information does goWholesale collect?</p>
				<p>Each time you visit goWholesale and its network of sites (“goWholesale”), we use a feature of your browser called a "cookie" to assign identification to your computer. The unique user ID contained within your cookie automatically identifies your computer — but not you — to our servers every time you visit our site.</p>
				<p>We log browser types, access times, URLs from which visitors came to our site and URLs viewed by visitors while on our site. Except as otherwise stated in this privacy policy, we do not provide this information to third parties, except in aggregate form.</p>
				<p>We also keep track of your computer's unique IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to better serve your needs and to administer our web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information about you, such as your location and your Internet Service Provider.</p>
				<p>We will, at certain times, ask you to provide us with personal information to register for our services or to enter a sweepstakes. This information may include, but is not limited to, your name and email address. Some of the requested information will be noted as being required for us to provide you with the desired services.</p>
				<p>If you sign up to advertise on goWholesale, we will collect your credit card information during the registration process. We make our best efforts to protect credit card transactions through encryption, although we cannot guarantee complete security. In order to complete a transaction, payment information may also be transferred through one of our financial processing partners who verify such information.</p>
				<p>Who collects the information?</p>
				<p>goWholesale usually collects any requested information from its users for its own purposes. However, goWholesale also has partners, which help us provide you with different content and advertising services.</p>
				<p>If you have any questions regarding the collection or receipt of the information you provide on our site, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@gowholesale.com">support@gowholesale.com</a>. Some of our content partners, as well as advertisers who display ads on our site, may use cookies or otherwise independently collect information from you. We cannot and do not control the collection or use of such information, or their use of cookies. We also do not have access to any information contained in or related to those cookies.</p>
				<p>What does goWholesale do with the data it collects?</p>
				<p>Whenever goWholesale collects data from any of its registered users, the data is intended to tailor or improve the experience of visitors to our site.</p>
				<p>From the data collected, we can customize content and advertising based on a user's unique preferences. We use information from a cookie to differentiate between unique users, personalize our site for each unique user, control the frequency of individual advertisements directed to individual computers, and other purposes. In all cases, specific personal information is not shared with our advertisers, except as otherwise stated in this privacy policy.</p>
				<p>We use unique computer IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web sites. IP addresses may be disclosed to a third party if we believe in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, or to protect the rights or property of goWholesale or others.</p>
				<p>When you register for the unique services offered on goWholesale, you willingly provide additional information to receive specific services and to experience personalized interactions on the site. We may use information to target offerings that may be of interest to you and/or to analyze aggregate user data to improve our services.</p>
				<p>We will send out occasional emails to provide you with information that we think you will find useful, including information about new products and services. We might also contact you to see if you are interested in participating in market research regarding goWholesale.</p>
				<p>In every such email, we will also have instructions on how to unsubscribe and avoid receiving any future emails from us. If at any time you feel you have received e-mail from goWholesale that you did not request, please notify us immediately (along with a copy of the e-mail) to <a href="mailto:feedback@gowholesale.com">feedback@gowholesale.com</a>.</p>
				<p>Under what circumstances does goWholesale share data?</p>
				<p>goWholesale may disclose your personal information to our business partners to provide you with any services you have willingly requested. If you have questions regarding the privacy policies or data-collection practices of any of goWholesale's partners, please contact that partner directly. goWholesale does not have control over and is not responsible for the data collection and use practices of our business partners.</p>
				<p>We also may disclose your personal information to a third party, if we believe in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, to protect the rights or property of goWholesale or others or as otherwise described in this privacy policy.</p>
				<p>We may also share aggregate demographic information with our advertisers or information collection companies, but in no case will we reveal any personally identifiable information in these instances.</p>
				<p>How can you update or correct your information?</p>
				<p>You can change your profile information by logging into your account at goWholesale, or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@gowholesale.com">support@gowholesale.com</a>.</p>
				<p>How can deactivate your registration on goWholesale?</p>
				<p>If you would like to deactivate your registration as an advertiser for one of the services offered on goWholesale, please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@gowholesale.com">support@gowholesale.com</a>.</p>
				<p>goWholesale currently does not have a method for completely deleting user information from our database. However, deleting the cookie stored on your computer will cause you to be perceived as a new user with no known user data. You may also change a setting in your browser, instructing it not to accept cookies, but this could prevent you from receiving some of goWholesale's key services.</p>
				<p>Procedures to protect the loss or misuse of information</p>
				<p>Except as otherwise stated in this privacy policy, goWholesale has taken stringent measures to ensure that information that is not publicly available through its site is accessible only to the user who initially entered the information or to authorized personnel at goWholesale or its partners, and only after a password has been entered.</p>
				<p>Privacy policies for sites linked to goWholesale</p>
				<p>As a search engine and portal, the site contains links to web sites not necessarily affiliated with us.</p>
				<p>goWholesale does not control the privacy practices of those sites to which goWholesale links and, therefore, goWholesale encourages you to read the privacy policies of those sites.</p>
				<p>These sites have their own policies and practices with respect to online privacy, and goWholesale cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these unaffiliated web sites.</p>
				<p>In addition, in certain instances a goWholesale advertiser may ask you for personal information. It will be your decision as to whether to provide such information, as goWholesale cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of its advertisers.</p>
				<p>Notification of Changes</p>
				<p>This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to goWholesale. We will post any such new privacy policies, along with the date of last revision, in prominent so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.</p>
				<p>Contact Information</p>
				<p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, or about goWholesale's information collection practices, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:feedback@gowholesale.com">feedback@gowholesale.com</a></p>
				<p>This Agreement was last revised on October 10th, 2005.</p>
