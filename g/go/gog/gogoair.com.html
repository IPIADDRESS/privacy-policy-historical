        <!-- Section: 1 -->
          <h3 class="terms-header" id="term1">1. Information Collected through our Services</h3>
          <p>The airlines on whose planes the Services are available do not collect any information through your use of the Services, but we may share certain types of information with such airlines, as described below.  Please remember that this policy only covers your activities while on the Gogo Domains; to the extent you visit third party websites, including the websites of our airline partners, the privacy policies of those websites will govern.  Users who reside outside of the United States should note that their information will be held and processed in the United States.  In certain circumstances, foreign courts, law enforcement agencies or regulatory agencies may be entitled to access your personal information without notice to you.  By submitting your Personal Information (as defined below), you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Personal Information You Provide to Us</strong><br>
            By using the Services, you may choose to provide information that could reasonably be used to contact you, or to identify you personally, or that otherwise relates to your person (such as your name, mailing or billing address, telephone number, or email address, email preferences, password for your Account and password hint question, and a complete set of credit card information that enables us to receive your payment (including your credit card authorization number) (collectively, “Personal Information”)).  For example, Gogo may collect Personal Information when you register on the Sites, purchase Services, request information, submit comments or participate in some promotion, survey or other feature of the Sites, or otherwise communicate or interact with us.  In addition, you may choose to provide contact information for friends you may wish us to contact.  When you provide us information for these “refer a friend” messages, we use the information only to send the message you request and the information will not be used for other marketing purposes unless your friend consents.  You may be identified to the friend in connection with such message.  Please check that friends you refer are happy for us to contact them.  The Sites may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic information (gender, zip code, age, etc.) or certain information about your preferences, product use and interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Information Collected by Automated Means</strong><br>
            Whenever you use the Services, Gogo, as well as any of our third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of tools and technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Services are accessed and used (“Usage Information”).  Usage Information may include, among other things, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, the type of content being transmitted (e.g., video content) or application being used, how many users visited the Sites, origin and destination information, flight information, subscriber status and the preceding page views.  This data helps us to manage our network and provides us with information about the use of the Services, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Sites, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on.  This information helps us to keep the Services fresh and interesting to our visitors and to tailor content to a visitor’s interests.  Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if Gogo associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, Gogo treats it as Personal Information.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Device Identifiers</strong><br>
            In the course of collecting Usage Information, Gogo also automatically collects your IP address, MAC Address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for the computer, mobile device, Wi-Fi card, technology or other device (collectively, “Device”) you use to access the Services.  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.  When you visit the Sites, we may view your Device Identifier.  We use this information to determine the physical location of your Device, including origin, destination, flight route information, and longitude and latitude information.  We also may use this information to enhance the Services and we may associate your Device Identifier with your Personal Information.  The technologies used on the Services to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, may include, without limitation:

We may use Cookies to collect and store certain information about your Account.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them).

In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web page, profile page or similar page on a social networking or other third party website or interactive service.</p>

          <h3 class="terms-header" id="term7">7. Advertising; How to Opt-out</h3>
          <p>Gogo licenses technology to serve advertisements on its own Sites and within its content as that content is served across the Internet.  In addition, Gogo may use third party analytics vendors to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Services and viewing of our content.  We do not share Personal Information with these third parties, but ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or analytics service providers may set and access their own Cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information.  We and our network advertisers may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your use of the Services, visits to the Sites and other websites. We may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements.</p>
          <p>If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt-out of some network advertising programs that use your information.  To do so please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Opt-Out Page: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>. European users canalso go to <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/">http://www.youronlinechoices.com</a> Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt-out), you will still see advertisements while you’re browsing online.  Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities.  These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive.  The DAA Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have Cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.</p>

We have no control over, do not review and cannot be responsible for these outside websites or their content.

          <h3 class="terms-header" id="term9">9. How We Protect Personal Information</h3>
          <p>The connection through which you access the Services is an SSL-encrypted link.  However, following such initial access, due to multiple users of our inflight Wi-Fi access point, Gogo does not provide an encrypted communication channel, such as Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), or Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA2), between our in-flight Wi-Fi access point and your Device.  Gogo does support secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) and Secure Shell (SSH) access.  If you have VPN, Gogo recommends that you use secure VPN protocols for greater security.  SSL-encrypted websites or pages, typically indicated by “https” in the address field and a “lock” icon, can also generally be accessed through the Gogo Services.  You should be aware, however, that data packets from un-encrypted Wi-Fi connections can be captured by technically advanced means when they are transmitted between a user’s Device and the Wi-Fi access point.  You should therefore take precautions to lower your security risks.  Gogo recommends that you follow good security practices, such as ensuring that file-sharing is not enabled while accessing the Internet from an un-encrypted public network and that laptops have a personal firewall and other protections against malware.  Gogo recommends that sensitive or private information should not be accessed via or transmitted over an un-encrypted connection.  While Gogo takes reasonable steps to protect your security, please be aware that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use the Services and provide us with your information at your own risk.</p>
