      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date: January 16, 2008</strong></p>
      <p>GoGrid has created this Privacy Policy to record and explain our commitment to privacy and to educate customers and other third parties about our data-handling.&nbsp; This policy lists the types of potentially private data GoGrid collects, explains how we use and protect that data, and discloses our key procedures surrounding privacy.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to GoGrid’s services and Website, <a href="http://www.gogrid.com/">www.GoGrid.com</a>.&nbsp; It doesn’t address use of data by our customers or by other third parties, even if the data is stored on one of GoGrid’s computers, collected through a Website we host, or collected through a Website hyperlinked to our Website.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The privacy of GoGrid's customers and affiliates is important to us. Therefore:</p>
      <p><em><strong>GoGrid does not sell or rent personally identifiable information.</strong></em></p>
      <p><em><strong>GoGrid does not spam or cooperate with spammers, and its policies forbid use of the Service for spam.</strong></em><br>
        (For details, see the AUP at GoGrid’s Website.)</p>
      <p><em><strong>GoGrid policy requires that all company employees sign a confidentiality agreement.</strong></em>&nbsp; <br>
        The agreement includes the following affirmation: </p>
      <p><em>I recognize that the Company has received and in the future will receive from third parties their confidential or proprietary information subject to a duty on the Company's part to maintain the confidentiality of such information and to use it only for certain limited purposes. I agree to hold all such confidential or proprietary information in the strictest confidence and not to disclose it to any person, firm or corporation or to use it except as necessary in carrying out my work for the Company consistent with the Company's agreement with such third party.</em></p>
      <h3>Data GoGrid Collects</h3>
      <p>A.&nbsp; GoGrid collects and uses data from our customers, and from visitors to our Website, as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Visitor Number Tracking:</em> GoGrid tracks the number of visitors to GoGrid’s website, as well as the      pages they visit within the site and the hyper-links they use (if any) to      leave.&nbsp; This doesn’t involve collection of any personally      identifiable information.&nbsp; We use this information to analyze      interest in and usage of the website and the Service.</li>
        <li><em>Data Provided Through      Inquiry Forms:</em> Website visitors interested in the Service can fill      out a sales inquiry form at the site.&nbsp; Those forms request company      name, individual name, title, address, telephone number(s), and email      address(es), as well as technical and business information related to the      Service.&nbsp; GoGrid’s sales team uses this information to contact the      potential customer and to discuss Service parameters.&nbsp; We also use      the information to generate statistics regarding interest in the      Service.&nbsp; We might share these statistics with third parties, but      they don’t include any personally identifiable information.</li>
        <li><em>Shopping Cart and Portal      Cookies:</em> GoGrid’s computer system uses cookies to recognize visitors      who use a shopping cart at the GoGrid website. &nbsp;The system also uses      cookies to recognize customers who use the customer portal at GoGrid’s      Website.&nbsp; The cookies facilitate easy use of the shopping carts and      the portal, as well as visitor number tracking, as explained in the first      bullet above.&nbsp; Cookies have no other purpose.&nbsp; We don’t use the      information for sales calls.</li>
        <li><em>Customer Account      Information:</em> When customers sign up for the Service, and during their      Service-relationship, we collect some or all of the following: company      name, individual name, title, address, telephone number(s), email      address(es), credit card number, and choice of service package.&nbsp; We      also record and retain most written communications with customers,      including trouble tickets, support requests, and payment history.&nbsp; GoGrid      uses this information for customer support.&nbsp; We also use contact      information to send customers Service-related announcements, including      newsletters and notices of new Service features and related products and      services provided by GoGrid partners.&nbsp; Customers can opt out of new      product/service notices by sending an email to <a href="mailto:marketing@servepath.com">marketing@GoGrid.com</a>, or by      following the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of any one of the      email notices. &nbsp;(However, current customers may not opt out of      necessary Service or account maintenance notices.)&nbsp; Finally, we      generate statistical information regarding our customer-base and use it to      analyze our business.&nbsp; We might share this statistical information      with third parties, but it doesn’t include any personally identifiable      information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>B.&nbsp; GoGrid also sometimes tracks and retains the IP addresses of visitors to our <em>customers’</em> Websites.&nbsp; This data may include personally identifiable information belonging to our customers’ <em>own</em> customers or to their Website visitors.&nbsp; GoGrid uses this data to maintain the security of the Service.</p>
      <h3>Hosted Data </h3>
      <p>A.&nbsp; Through the Service, GoGrid provides computing and network infrastructure that hosts customer Websites, Internet communications, and other applications.&nbsp; As a result, our infrastructure stores and transmits information about customers’ businesses, as well as information collected by those businesses (collectively, “<strong>Hosted Data</strong>”).&nbsp; This Hosted Data may include personally identifiable information and other information that belongs to customers’ <em>own </em>customers, Website visitors, or other users.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>B.&nbsp; GoGrid is a passive recipient of Hosted Data: we take no active part in collecting it, and generally we do not access its content.&nbsp; However, GoGrid staff may occasionally access Hosted Data through delivery of services and support to customers.&nbsp; For instance, staff may come into contact with Hosted Data by verifying back-up and restore processes, by verifying that applications are running properly, or through debugging efforts.</p>
      <h3>Use of Personally Identifiable Information and Hosted Data</h3>
      <p>A. GoGrid doesn't share personally identifiable information or Hosted Data under any circumstances, except as provided in paragraph B below and: (i) as requested by law enforcement agencies or required by law; (ii) to maintain the security of the Service and of GoGrid's own systems and data, including by assisting third party claimants in investigating security breaches; (3) to collect money owed to GoGrid, including through legal proceedings; and (4) to identify, contact, or take legal action against customers or third parties violating GoGrid's acceptable use policy, interfering with property rights or with the Service, or breaking the law. GoGrid doesn't access or use Hosted Data except through provision of debugging and related services, as described under "Hosted Data" above, and for the reasons listed in the preceding sentence.</p>
      <p>B. GoGrid sometimes employs independent contractors to help run the Service, and such contractors may have access to data, similar to the access we give our employees. Also, GoGrid stores sales account data, including customer passwords and personally identifiable information, with a third party application service provider. The current provider is SalesForce.com. This third party data storage does not apply to Hosted Data.</p>
      <h3>Data Protection</h3>
      <p>A. GoGrid takes precautions to ensure that access to databases containing customer information is available only from within GoGrid's internal network. Further, we typically encrypt financial information during transmission, or use secure protocols. No protocol, encryption, or other precaution can provide complete security for electronic data, but we are committed to reasonable, industry standard precautions.</p>
      <p>B. GoGrid policy requires that all its employees execute a confidentiality agreement which includes the affirmation quoted at the start of this Privacy Policy. GoGrid is under contract with a professional employment organization ("PEO"), and that PEO helps enforce our policy requiring confidentiality agreements. Most contractors also sign a confidentiality agreement, with obligations similar to the employees'. (Customers and other third parties are not beneficiaries of the employee confidentiality agreement, or of GoGrid's agreements with independent contractors or with the PEO, and so have no rights to enforce those contracts.)</p>
      <p>C. For information about security of sales account data stored with SalesForce.com, please visit <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/" target="_blank">http://www.salesforce.com/</a>. </p>
      <h3>Changing Account Information</h3>
      <p>Customers can change their account information. Most customers can do so via their online personal control panel/account information page. All other customers can access and change account information by contacting their GoGrid billing department.</p>
      <h3>Reporting Misuse of Data</h3>
      <p>Customers and other third parties should contact GoGrid about any suspected misuse of their personally identifiable information or other data.&nbsp; All such inquiries or complaints should be directed to us via email to <a href="mailto:abuse@servepath.com">abuse@GoGrid.com</a>. </p>
      <h3>Additional Information</h3>
      <p>GoGrid is not responsible for use or misuse of data by any third party, including any GoGrid customer. In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and GoGrid's Terms of Service, posted at our Website, the terms of service will govern. This Privacy Policy is subject to change, so please review this page periodically. </p>
