          This Privacy Policy also applies generally to our subsidiaries or joint venture websites (where applicable). By visiting the Site or downloading SHOPLINE you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.<br>
          If you do not agree please do not use or access our Site.<br>
          This Privacy Policy describes the information, as part of the normal operation of our services; we collect from you and what may happen to that information.<br>
          All of our subsidiaries and joint ventures operate under similar privacy practices as described in this Privacy Policy and, subject to the requirements of applicable law.<br>
          By accepting the Privacy Policy and the SHOPLINE User Agreement upon registration, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br>
          This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the User Agreement.
        </p>
        <h5>INFORMATION COLLECTED OR RECEIVED</h5>
        <p>
          We will not sell or disclose your name, email address or other personal information to third parties without your explicit consent, except as specified in this policy.<br>
          As a SHOPLINE member you may elect to provide a valid email address at registration and choose a username or alias that may represent your identity on SHOPLINE.<br>
          Depending on which services you choose to use, we may require additional information, such as billing address, telephone number, and/or a physical mailing address.<br>
          We may contact individual users to confidentially request more information about their identities or items listed on the site, to ensure compliance with our rules and policies.<br>
          You may optionally choose to provide your full name and other personal information (such as birthday, gender, location) to other users on SHOPLINE in connection to your account and activity.<br>
          Your username or alias is publicly displayed and connected to your SHOPLINE activity.<br>
          Other people may see your date joined, feedback, ratings, profile information, listed items, liked items, followers and comments on SHOPLINE.<br>
          We automatically receive and record some information from your browser when you visit the site, such as your IP address, cookies and data [Anything else we collect on the website or app] about which pages you visit on the site through the use of log files provided by our third-party tracking-utility partners.<br>
          This information helps us analyse and understand how the site works for members and visitors, and provide a more personalised experience for members and visitors.<br>
          Some members or visitors may connect to or register a SHOPLINE account using an external third-party application, such as Facebook.<br>
          We may receive some data from those connected third-party applications.<br>
          Connecting your SHOPLINE account to third-party applications or services is optional.<br>
          We may receive or collect information (e.g. email address) about a person who is not yet a registered SHOPLINE member (a “non-member”) in connection with certain SHOPLINE features, including but not limited to: a non-member subscribing to a SHOPLINE newsletter, a member inviting a non-member to visit the Site or to download the App onto their mobile device, or a non-member engaging in a transaction.<br>
          Non-member information is used only for the purpose for which it was originally submitted to us.<br>
          A non-member can contact SHOPLINE Support if they do not want SHOPLINE to retain any of their information.<br>
          We use the information described in this policy to provide and improve our services, for billing and payments, for identification and authentication purposes, to contact members or interested parties, and for general research and aggregate reporting.<br>
          SHOPLINE’s User Agreement require all account owners to be at least 18 years of age (or have the permission and supervision of a responsible parent or legal guardian), therefore, this policy does not discuss use of our site or services by minors.

        <h5>SPECIAL NOTE TO CHILDREN</h5>
        <p>Children (persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to use SHOPLINE unsupervised and we ask that children do not submit any personal information to us. It is our policy not to knowingly solicit or permit children under the age of 18 to provide their personal information for any purpose.

          You may remove certain optional information you no longer wish to be publicly visible, such as your full name.<br>
          For various reasons, SHOPLINE may contact you about our services or your activity.<br>

        </p>
        <h5>SECURITY</h5>
        <p>
          The security of your personal information is important to us.<br>
          SHOPLINE has implemented security measures designed to protect the Personal Information you share with us, including physical, electronic and procedural measures. Among other things, we offer HTTPS secure access to most areas on our Services, and the transmission of sensitive payment information (such as a credit card number) through our designated purchase forms is protected by an industry standard SSL/TLS encrypted connection. We also regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and regularly seek new ways and Third Party Services for further enhancing the security of our Services and protection of our Visitors’ and Users’ privacy.<br>
          However - while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security of your Personal Information, your customers’ information or any other User Content you upload, publish or otherwise share with SHOPLINE or anyone else. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.<br>
          We therefore encourage you to set strong passwords for your User Account and User Website. It is important that you protect against unauthorized access of your account and information by choosing your password carefully, and keeping your password and computer secure by signing out after using our services.<br>
          If you have any questions regarding the security of our Services, you are more than welcome to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@shoplineapp.com">info@shoplineapp.com</a>.
        </p>
        <h5>DATA RETENTION</h5>
        <p>
          We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.<br>
          If you no longer want us to use your information to provide you services, you may close your SHOPLINE account.<br>
          We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our agreements and/or protect our legitimate interests.<br>
          As always, you can contact us to request that we remove your data from our system. We can also help if your customers or visitors ask you to delete data that we store in our system on your behalf.
        </p>
        <h5>PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</h5>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it periodically.<br>
          We’ll communicate changes by posting a notice on the site.<br>
          If we make material changes to this policy you will be notified here, by email, or other places we deem appropriate.
        </p>
        <h5>COOKIES</h5>
