<p>Liquidity Services, Inc., owner and operator of the website: <a href="http://www.go-dove.com/"><b>www.go-dove.com</b></a>, a marketplace of Liquidity Services, Inc. (LSI), wants you to know that we take your privacy very seriously. Because we do, we have developed the following privacy policy that states what information we collect, how that information is collected (whether it is by LSI, a subsidiary of LSI, a vendor working for LSI or one of its subsidiaries, or via some other means), for what purposes we collect information, how that information is used, and under what circumstances that information would be released. Additionally, we want you to know when you have a choice regarding the collection or dissemination of any personal information, and how you can exercise your options. This privacy policy will also explain what steps LSI is taking to secure your private information and what steps you should take to safeguard that information. Finally, the privacy policy will tell you how to correct any inaccurate information, and who you can contact regarding questions about our privacy policy.<br>
    We may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure you are happy with any changes. LSI is the parent company of GoIndustry Operations Limited and its affiliates (collectively "GoIndustry DoveBid").</p>

<h2>What information does LSI collect?</h2>
<h3>Information We Collect from All Persons Who Access Our Website</h3>
