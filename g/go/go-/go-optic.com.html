<tr>
<td class="pt10" bgcolor="#ffffff">1.) Go-Optic.com (a SM of Eye Trends USA, Inc.) reserves the right to refuse service to anyone.<br><br>2.) After an order has successfully been placed with our company, cancellation of an item (or items) in your order may result in a cancellation fee, which is 10% of the cancelled items price. Shipping fee's will be excluded in this fee and cancellation of back-ordered Items will not be subject to cancellation fee's.<br><br>3.) Cancellation of lenses, lens coatings &amp; tints (for glasses) may result in a cancellation fee of 30% on the lenses, the glasses will hold the same cancellation fee as in Section 2 (listed above). This cancellation fee will help us cover any non-recoverable expenses which have already been incurred.<br><br>4.) Customers that order prescription eyeglasses that are full rim-less (lens drilling and mounting necessary) will be responsible an additional charge of $20 for drilling &amp; mounting. The drilling &amp; mounting fee is sometimes included, and is displayed that it is being included, in the lens price when selecting a lens type for your full rimless glasses, however this is not always guaranteed. We will contact the customer and confirm if there is a price change of this sort, before we continue processing their order.<br><br>5.) Your credit card will not be charged any funds over your grand total order amount, unless we have received your confirmation to allow us to charge of any additional funds if necessary. Otherwise your order can be cancelled without being charged any cancellation fee.<br><br>6.) International customer orders will be responsible for all customs fee's, tax's or any other fee's associated with the delivery of their ordered merchandise.<br><br>7.) All back-ordered items will be kept on order unless the customer has requested for it to be canceled. There will be no cancellation fee's on items which are on back-order.<br><br>8.) Back-order dates are estimated and may change (sooner or later) due to the availability of the product provided by the designated manufacturer(s) and/or distributor(s).<br><br>9.) All prescription eyeglass/contact lens orders will be processed according to the information we have been provided by the patient's doctor. Go-Optic.com (a SM of Eye Trends USA, Inc.) cannot alter a patient's prescription under any circumstance.<br><br>10.) Go-Optic.com (a SM of Eye Trends USA, Inc.) and/or it's business partners reserves the right to call the eye care provider(s) referred to in the order to confirm the prescription or any other information that is necessary to process a prescription order, and we may also request a copy of your prescription for our records. <br><br>11.) All trademarks, product names, and company names and logos appearing on this web site are the property of their respective owners. This is a private web site not endorsed or affiliated with these companies. Information provided is believed to be accurate but not guaranteed.<br><br>12.) Each shipping address update/redirection request will be an additional fee, which is the customers responsibility, of $5 which helps cover the FedEx rate expense for this type of request.<br><br>13.) Due to certain frame styles and/or prescriptions, Custom lenses can require additional expenses due to the additional materials or labor used to fill custom lens requests. After the lab reviews the order, we will inform you if any other lens related fee's, such as Oversize Fee, Custom Lens Surfacing Fee, Prism Fee, etc. will be needed to fill your lens request. You will be notified to confirm the additional fee prior to us proceeding with your order. If you choose not to confirm the additional fee, your lens order can be cancelled with-out being charged cancellation fee's. Not all lens requests are guaranteed. If we feel that we are unable to provide accurate,properly functioning and fitting lens requests, then we have the right to reject a lens order. <br><br>14.) The Seg. Height (vertical measurement) of the lens is calculated by a formula which is for bi-focal, tri-focal and progressive lens requests. If a Seg. Height measurement is available that you would like for us to use, then you can provide this information in the 'Comments Section' of your order during check-out, and we will process this for you accordingly. However, please ensure that if you are providing a Seg. Height measurement, then it must be the same measurement used for the same exact eyeglass frames (same size as well) that you're purchasing from us, since the Seg. Height measurement is dependant on the frame size. If a Seg. height measurement is not provided by the customer or their eye care provider(s), then we will use our in-house formula for making the progressive lenses in your order. Our in-house formula is accurate in most cases, but is not guaranteed. We do suggest that this information is provided to ensure the accuracy of your bi-focal/tri-focal/progressive lens, however if this information is not provided, then we do not accept any responsibility of you having to adapt to the lens with this measurement. The Seg Height is not a required part of an eyeglass prescription, this information is to be provided by the customer [or their eye care provider(s)] as an additional request in their lens order. <br><br>15.) Eyeglass frames purchased with-out additional lenses may come with the lenses that are sold this way from the vendor. This means that there may be a brand logo or any other engraving and/or marking(s) on the lenses which the manufacturer includes on them. Most eyeglass frames are intended to be used for prescription reasons, which means the lenses are usually meant to be replaced. We do offer plano lenses which can be made for these types of frames. These options can be seen on the lenses pricing page, under 'Non-Prescription/Plano' lenses. <br><br>16.) Prices may change on contact lenses depending on the prescription paremeters provided. If there is any price difference on a contact lens order, the customer will be notified to confirm these fee's prior to processing. If the customer decides to cancel at this point (prior ro confirming the price difference), they can cancel the merchandise with no cancellation fee's. <br><br></td></tr></tbody></table>
