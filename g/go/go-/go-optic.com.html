            customer and confirm if there is a Price change of this Sort, before 
            we continue processing their order.<br>           
            <br>
            5.) Your Credit Card will not be charged any funds over your

12.) A Fedex Shipping Redirection request will be an additional fee of $10 which helps cover the FedEx rate expense for this type of request.<br><br>
13.) Due to certain frame styles and/or prescriptions, Custom lenses can require additional expenses due to the additional materials or labor used to fill custom lens requests.  After the lab reviews the order, they will inform you if any other lens related fee's, such as Oversize Fee, Custom Lens Surfacing Fee, Prism Fee, etc. will be needed to accurately fill your request.
You will be notified to confirm the additional fee. If you choose not to confirm the additional fee, your lens order can be cancelled w/ no cancellation fee's. These fee's usually range around $20 - $45 additional.

Not all lens requests are guaranteed, if we feel that we are unable to provide accurate,properly functioning and fitting lens requests, then we do have the right to reject a lens order.
<br><br>
14.) The Seg Height (vertical measurement) of the lens is calculated by a formula which in house for progressive lens requests. If a Seg Height measurement is available that you would like for us to use, then you can provide this information in the 'Comments Section' of your order during check-out, and we can process this for you accordingly. However, please ensure that if you are providing a Seg Height Measurement, then it is the same measurement used for the same exact eyeglass frames (same size as well) that you're purchasing from us, since the Seg Height measurement is dependant on the frame size.   If a Seg height measurement is not provided by the customer, then we will use our in-house formula for making the progressive lenses in your order.
