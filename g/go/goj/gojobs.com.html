different privacy statement is specifically made applicable). By using a GO
Jobs, Inc. Web site, you consent to the policies and practices described in
this Statement. <br>
<br>
Your data will be stored and processed in whole or in part in the United
States. If you access a GO Jobs Web site outside the United States, your usage
of that site constitutes consent to the transfer of your data out of your
country and to the United States. <br>
<br>
Our sites contain links to other Web sites over which we have no control. GO

GO Jobs collects or may collect demographic information that is not unique to
you such as your ZIP code, age, preferences, gender, interests and favorites.
Sometimes we collect or may collect a combination of the two types of
information. Examples of areas on GO Jobs Web sites where we collect personal

MyGOJobs account, sign up to use a service, post a resume, enter a contest or
purchase a product.<br>

We also gather or may gather certain information about your use of our site,
such as what areas you visit and what services you access. Moreover, there is
information about your computer hardware and software that is or may be collected
by GO Jobs. This information can include without limitation your IP address,
browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. <br>
<br>
GO Jobs may sometimes afford you the opportunity to provide descriptive,
cultural, behavioral, preferential and/or life style information about
yourself, but it is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If
you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that
information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this
Statement. For example, such information may be used for the purpose of
determining your potential interest in receiving email or other communications
about particular products or services. <br>
<br>
Since we believe that managing your career is a life-long process, we retain
indefinitely all the information we gather about you in an effort to make your
repeat use with us more efficient, practical, and relevant. Of course, you can
correct or update your MyGOJobs account profile and resume at any time.
Moreover, you can delete your resume from our online database or close your
MyGOJobs account at any time, in which event we will remove all our copies of
your resume and MyGOJobs account profile information except for an archival
copy which is not accessible on the Internet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
