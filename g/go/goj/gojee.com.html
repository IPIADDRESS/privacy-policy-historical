        useful, and efficient experience. We collect the following
        types of information from our users:
      </p>

      <p>

        referring URL, and timestamp information. We use this type
        of information to administer the Gojee Service and provide
        the highest possible level of service to you. We also use
        this information in the aggregate to perform statistical

        more relevant suggestions to you.

      <h3>Transfer of Information</h3>

      <p>
        We may distribute Your Public Content to third parties, as
        permitted pursuant to our Terms of Service. The third
        parties may in turn publicly display or publish Your Public
        Content in connection with their own websites and media
        platforms. When we distribute Your Public Content to third
        parties, we typically include your Display Name (but not
        your Personal Information unless you include your Personal
        Information in Your Public Content).
      </p>

      <p>
        We may share your Personal Information and Your Shopping
        History with third parties to provide you with services that
        we offer through Gojee Service (i.e. Coupons), conduct
        quality assurance testing, facilitate creation of accounts,
        provide technical and customer support, or provide specific
        services, such as synchronization of your contacts with
        other software applications, in accordance with your
        instructions. These third parties are required not to use
        your Personal Information other than to provide the services
        requested by you.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may share your Personal Information and Shopping History
        with subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under
        a common control (collectively, "Affiliates") that we may
        have now or in the future, in which case we will require
        them to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company
        acquires our company or our assets, that company will
        possess your Personal Information, and will assume the
        rights and obligations with respect to that information as
        described in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may disclose your Personal Information or Shopping
        History to third parties in a good faith belief that such
        disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action
        regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply
        our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy; (c) comply with
        legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute,
        or court order; or (d) protect our rights, reputation, and
        property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the
        public. Please note that we are not required to question or
        contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or
        other similar governmental request that we receive.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may disclose information in the aggregate to third
        parties relating to user behavior in connection with actual
        or prospective business relationship with those third
        parties, such as advertisers and content distributors. For
        example, we may disclose the number of users that have been
        exposed to, or clicked on, advertising banners.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may use third party advertising companies to serve ads
        when you visit the Gojee Service. These companies may use
        information about Your Public Content (not including your
        name, address, email address, or telephone number), Your
        Shopping History and Activity related to your use of the
        Gojee Service to provide advertisements about goods and
        services of interest to you.

        information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person
        about the invitation. By providing us with another person's

        we do not share your Personal Information with those third
        parties, and are not responsible for their privacy
        practices. We suggest you read the privacy policies on all
        such third party websites.

      <h3>Controlling Your Personal Data</h3>

      <p>
        To the extent you include Personal Information in Your

        account, and contact you. Please do not include information
        in Your Public Content that you expect to keep private.
      </p>

      <p>
        Third parties can also associate you with your user account
        using the user search and browse features of the Gojee
        Service, which display Your Public Content. Third parties
        can only find you using your Personal Information if they
        know this information in the first place.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may request to deactivate your account at any time by
        contacting Gojee. If you deactivate your account, we will
        use commercially reasonable efforts to stop displaying your
        profile on the Service. Public Content that you have
        contributed to Gojee prior to account deactivation (such as
        sightings of food or comments on sightings) may continue to
        displayed. We may still retain your Personal Information and
        Your Public Content in our systems. Registered users who

      </p>

      <p>
        We are very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality
        of your personally identifiable information. We employ
        administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to
        protect your information from unauthorized access. Although

        unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure
        you that your Personal Information will never be disclosed.

              of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your
              unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via

              expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay,
              consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement
              or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the
              breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data
              system.
      </p>
