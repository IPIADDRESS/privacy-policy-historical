<p><strong>Bauer Media Pty Limited: Privacy Policy</strong><br>
In this policy "we", "us' and "our" means Bauer Media Pty Limited,
its subsidiaries and affiliated companies.<br>
<br>
Please read this policy carefully as it describes the way in which
we collect and handle your personal information.<br>
<br>
We may update or revise this policy from time to time. If we elect
to update or revise this policy, we will post the date on which
that revision takes effect at the end of this policy.<br>
<br>
Please be aware that you have no obligation to provide any personal
information requested by us. However, if you choose to withhold
your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with
the services or products that depend on the collection and use of
that information.<br>
<br>
<strong>1 Our privacy commitment</strong><br>
We recognise the importance of, and are committed to, managing any
personal information that we collect in compliance with the Privacy
Act 1988 (Cth), which includes the Australian Privacy Principles,
and other Australian privacy laws (together, "Privacy Laws").<br>
<br>
As a member of the Australian Press Council ("APC"), we also ensure
any personal information we collect in the course of our
journalistic activities is managed in accordance with the APC
Statement of Privacy Principles.<br>
<br>
<strong>2 How do we collect personal information?</strong><br>
Where possible, we collect your personal information directly from
you. This collection includes through your:<br>
- registration when you purchase a magazine or digital
subscription;<br>
- entry into promotions or competitions;<br>
- answers to surveys;<br>
- signing up to newsletters and other notifications from our
magazines and other brands;<br>
- signing up to join our online communities;<br>
- registration to attend events;<br>
- provision of express permission when accessing applications
sitting on Bauer brand social media accounts;<br>
- application for an internship or employment with us;<br>
- communications with us such as letters, telephone calls, text
messaging and emails regarding services and products;<br>
- registration for our loyalty clubs; and<br>
- download and use of our digital publications and mobile
applications ("apps").<br>
<br>
In some circumstances, however, we may also collect your personal
information from third parties or public agencies where it is
unreasonable or impracticable for us to collect the personal
information directly from you. For example, if you subscribe to one
of our magazines through a third party that is authorised to take
subscriptions for us, we will collect your personal information
from that third party. If we have difficulty in delivering a
magazine to you, we may make enquiries in an effort to locate your
address or correct any error in our recorded address details for
you.<br>
<br>
In some circumstances, we may provide you access to our online
communities through the option of a third party platform sign on
(including but not limited to, social sign ons). In this instance
we will be accessing and collecting the personal information which
you have authorised the third party platform to pass on to us.
Where we collect personal information from third parties, we will
ensure that the collection is conducted in a fair and lawful manner
and the information is reasonably necessary for our functions or
activities.<br>
<br>
<strong>3 What personal information do we collect?</strong><br>
The personal information we collect varies depending upon the
purpose of the collection and the product or service we are
providing you. Generally, we collect and hold the following types
of personal information:<br>
- your name and address;<br>
- your telephone e-mail contact details;<br>
- your date of birth;<br>
- your gender;<br>
- other information you may make publically available online
(including but not limited to on social media platforms);<br>
- transaction details, if you make a purchase with us or choose to
store details in your online profile;<br>
- bank account/credit card numbers and associated details as
reasonably required in relation to processing payments at your
request; and<br>
- any other personal information which may be required in order to
facilitate and where possible improve your dealings with us.<br>
<br>
However, for certain purposes, such as where you apply for
employment with us, we will collect additional personal information
such as your employment history, educational history and employment
references.<br>
<br>
We generally do not collect sensitive information that is
associated with an identifiable individual.<br>
We may from time to time collect information that would be
sensitive personal information about you with your consent where
the collection is related to provision of a service or other
benefit to you. For example, we collect information from expectant
mothers in relation to them and their families with their consent,
in order to provide them with baby products and associated
maternity benefits.<br>
We may collect information from you about particular health
concerns, gender orientation or other sensitive information with
your consent, in order to provide you with offers or promotions
related to your concerns or status.<br>
<br>
In the event that we are required to collect sensitive personal
information, we will notify you of this at the point of collection
and obtain your consent to collect and hold this sensitive personal
information.<br>
<br>
If you provide us with sensitive information on an unsolicited
basis, we assess whether such information is reasonably necessary
for one or more of our functions or activities. The unsolicited
sensitive information you disclose to us may be used and disclosed
for the purpose for which you provided such information or, where
you would reasonably expect us to, we may use the information for a
directly related secondary purpose. We may also disclose or use the
information for other purposes with your consent or if required to
by law.<br>
<br>
<strong>4 Why do we collect and use your personal
information?</strong><br>
We will collect your personal information if it is reasonably
necessary for the performance of our business activities and
functions, which includes providing a range of products and
services to you, some of which are listed below.<br>
<br>
<strong>4.1 Registration for magazine subscriptions</strong><br>
We collect personal information from individuals who subscribe to
our magazines in order to process their payments and to confirm
whether they would like to receive promotional materials in the
future.<br>
We will also seek your consent to send to you Magshop promotional
material and special offers. Where you have a subscription for a
magazine published by us, then we will also send you that
magazine's regular newsletter as well as promotional material and
occasionally (where notice has been given) you may also be sent
special offers from third parties associated with that title.
.<br>
<br>
<strong>4.2 Sales Promotions, Competitions, Surveys and
registration to attend our events</strong><br>
We collect personal information when you respond to one of our
promotions, competitions or surveys or when you register to attend
an event in order to inform you if you have won a prize, to place
you on a guest-list to the event and to help us better understand
what products and services you would like to receive information
about in the future.<br>
<br>
<strong>4.3 Our mobile apps</strong><br>
We, or a service provider, may collect information through our apps
to assist us in understanding how you use our apps, how the apps
are performing across different handsets and to assist us in the
selection of advertisements for groups of individuals. Our access
to this information, is as you have agreed to with the respective
app store from which you download our app.<br>
<br>
<strong>4.4 Registration for our newsletters, online communities
and/or loyalty clubs</strong><br>
We collect personal information when you sign up to register for
our newsletters or join one of our online communities or loyalty
clubs. By providing this personal information we are able to keep
you updated on special offers and events that you may be interested
in and to reward your commitment to the brands.<br>
<br>
<strong>4.5 Our online communities</strong><br>
We collect personal information from you when you participate in
any activity on our online communities. By providing personal
information to us during such activity, we can assist in
identifying ways in which we can provide you with a better service,
or enhance your online experience.<br>
<br>
<strong>Employment or internship</strong><br>
We collect personal information from applicants who are seeking
employment or an internship with us as part of the recruitment
process. In circumstances where you do not provide the mandatory
personal information, we will be unable to consider you for a
position with us.<br>
<br>
<strong>4.7 Bounty Rewards</strong><br>
We collect your personal information when you register with Bounty
Rewards in order to keep you informed of upcoming offers, new
products and services and periodically you may be sent newsletters,
communications or special offers directly from third party
clients.<br>
<br>
We also use your personal information to help us verify your
identity, display content and advertising that are customised to
your interests, preferences and experiences and for business
research and product development.<br>
<br>
From time to time there may be other purposes for which we collect,
hold, use and disclose your personal information. We will tell you
about these at the point of collection.<br>
<br>
<strong>Direct Marketing and Research</strong><br>
As set out above, we may use personal information about you for
marketing and research purposes. However, you can manage your
communication preferences with us in a number of ways, eg if you
are an online customer, you will be provided options to manage your
own online profile; you may also contact our Privacy Officer. In
addition, the marketing communications that we send to you will
also contain information on how to unsubscribe from those
communications.<br>
<br>
You can also tell us at any time if you do not want us to disclose
your details to other organisations such as our related companies
or third parties for marketing purposes. To do this, you just need
to contact our Privacy Officer.<br>
<br>
Sometimes we extract information from our collected records to
produce aggregated data. This aggregated data does not identify
individuals. We use the aggregated data for research purposes,
product development and may share the data with third
parties.<br>
<br>
<strong>5 Who do we disclose your personal information
to?</strong><br>
We provide your personal information to third parties where you
have consented to such disclosure. We also provide your personal
information to third parties in order to carry out our business
activities and functions. This may include:<br>
- newsagents for the purpose of fulfilling subscriptions to our
publications;<br>
- organisations who are sponsoring or otherwise involved with or
participating in a promotion, offer, competition or survey;<br>
- other companies or individuals we engage to perform functions on
our behalf, such as mailing a subscription, processing credit card
information, mailing information or prizes, data analysis,
telemarketing, research and advertising, IT support services;
and<br>
- with your specific and prior consent, to other companies or
individuals for the purposes you have consented to.<br>
<br>
We disclose your personal information offshore to our owners, joint
venture partners, service providers and agents. It is not
practicable to specify all countries to which we may disclose your
personal information as, among other things, we are part of a
global organisation. The countries and regions your personal
information will be disclosed to include New Zealand, the USA,
Philippines and Europe.<br>
<br>
We ensure that any organisation which we disclose your personal
information to is subject to appropriate contractual obligations to
safeguard and protect your personal information and comply with all
Privacy Laws.<br>
<br>
In certain circumstances, we may disclose your personal information
where required or authorised to do so by law, including in
emergency situations and to assist law enforcement agencies. We
will always ensure that those to whom we disclose your personal
information have the legal right to receive it.<br>
<br>
<strong>6 How is your personal information secured?</strong><br>
We understand that the security of your personal information is
important. As such, we take reasonable steps to protect your
personal information from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised

<strong>8 The use of cookies and web beacons through our websites
and apps</strong><br>
Information may be collected when you access our websites or apps,
such as the time and specific page or app you visited. This
information is collected through "cookies". A "cookie" is a small
piece of information, or file, that a website or app sends to your
computer's hard drive while you are viewing that website or app for
record keeping purposes. Most web browsers are automatically set to
accept cookies. If you do not wish to receive any cookies you may
set your browser to refuse cookies. However, this will mean you
will not be able to take full advantage of our websites or
apps.</p>

<p>We, and our service providers, use the information collected
from cookies for a number of reasons:<br>
- for statistical purposes in order to track how many users we have
and how often they visit our website or apps;<br>
- to provide statistical data, ratings and other information for
industry and other public reporting;<br>
- to provide you with a more personalised, convenient and
interactive experience on our websites or apps;<br>
- to track who has viewed an advertisement or clicked-through an
advertisement; and<br>
- to provide you with a more targeted advertising experience both
on and off our websites or apps, allowing us to impose restrictions
where appropriate and monitor how effective an advertising campaign
has been.<br>
<br>
We engage various analytic programs, including Flurry Analytics,
Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics to analyse the performance of
our websites and apps and to provide us with reports that contain
aggregated, de-identified benchmark information that assists us to
understand when, and how many times, you have used our websites or
apps. The anonymous information assists us in the selection of
advertisements for groups of individuals.<br>
<br>
We may also use Google Analytics features (including Google
Remarketing, Google Display Network Impressions Reporting, the
Double Click Campaign Manager and Google Analytics Demographics and
Interest Reporting) on our websites and apps. Google Analytics uses
both first party and third party cookies to record standard
internet traffic information such as when, and how many times, you
have visited our websites or apps. We, and some third parties
(including Google and the Krux data management platform), also use
the information to optimise advertising selection for groups of
individuals based on demographic information. The cookies allow us
and other third parties (including Google) to evaluate your
interactions with advertising services on our websites and apps and
serve targeted advertising on those websites and apps and across
the Internet. We have enabled Google Analytics for Display
Advertising, which allows Google and other third parties to
advertise to you on our websites and apps and across the
Internet.<br>
<br>
By using Google Ads Settings (located at
https://www.google.com/settings/ads), you can opt out of these
features at any time and customise your Google Display Network Ads.
Alternatively, you can opt out of a third party's vendor's use of
cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page
(located at https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).<br>
<br>

advertisement recommendations from Flurry by clicking on
http://www.flurry.com/user-opt-out.html.<br>
