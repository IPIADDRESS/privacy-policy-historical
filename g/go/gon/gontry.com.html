           Gontry.com only processes personal information for the purposes described in the applicable Privacy Policy and/or privacy notice for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Choices for personal information </b>
					When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. </li> 
				<br><br>
                <li>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will 		offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for 	purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. 
					You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Gontry.com may not be able to provide those services to you. </li>
               <br><br>
				<li><b>Information security </b>
					We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. </li>
				<br><br>
				<li>We restrict access to personal information to Gontry.com employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop 	or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal 	prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.  </li>
				<br><br>
				<li><b>Data integrity </b>
					Gontry.com processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. </li>
                <br><br>
				<li><b>Accessing and updating personal information </b>
					When you use Gontry.com services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users'personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services. </li>
                <br><br>

We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Gontry.com and an individual.</li>
                <br><br>
				<li><b>Changes to this policy </b>
					Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will try not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy changes). </li>
