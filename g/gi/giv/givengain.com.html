						<h3>Scope of this Data Protection and Privacy Policy</h3>
						<p>
							This Data Protection and Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by GivenGain through its websites.

						<p>
							This Data Protection and Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals.

						<h3>Data collected and purposes of the collection</h3>
						<h4><em>Non-personal data</em></h4>
						<p>
							Like most website operators, GivenGain collects from visitors of GivenGain’s websites non-personal data of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site and the date and time of each visitor request. GivenGain's purposes in collecting such non-personal data are to optimize users’ experience of the GivenGain’s websites and render them more user-friendly, better understand how visitors use GivenGain’s websites and analyze their behavior for statistical purposes, for example by monitoring the most popular service accounts on the GivenGain’s websites. From time to time, GivenGain may release non-personal data in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its websites. GivenGain may display this information publicly or provide it to third parties.
						</p>
						<h4><em>Personal data</em></h4>
						<p>
							Certain users of GivenGain's websites choose to interact with GivenGain in ways that require GivenGain to gather personal data. GivenGain does not collect and process more personal data than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which personal data is collected and processed.

								</li>
								<li>
									<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Support:</em></span> if you send GivenGain a request (for example via a support email or via one of GivenGain feedback mechanisms), GivenGain reserves the right to publish it in order to help GivenGain clarify or respond to your request or to help GivenGain support other users.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Legal and other purposes:</em></span> GivenGain may process personal data (a) to the extent necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which GivenGain is subject, (b) to respond to requests from competent public and government authorities, (c) to perform a task carried out in the public interest, (d) to enforce this Data Protection and Privacy Policy and (e) to protect GivenGain’s legitimate interests (in such a case, GivenGain will disclose to you the legitimate interests at stake). 
								</li>
							</ul>
