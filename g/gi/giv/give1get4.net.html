									This Privacy Policy is for the Give1Get4

									web site and it's affiliated web sites.

								</p>

								<p>

									We can be reached via e-mail at <u><a href="mailto:support@give1get4.net" target="_blank" style="color: #000;">support@give1get4.net</a>.</u>

								</p>

								<p>

									For each visitor to our Web site, our

									Web server automatically recognizes the visitor's IP address.

								</p>

								<p>

									We collect user-specific information

									on which pages visitors' access or visit.  We also collect information

									volunteered by the visitor, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

								</p>

								<p>

									The information we collect is used to

									improve the content of our Web page, to customize the content and/or

									layout of our page for each individual visitor, and to provide further

									information regarding Give1Get4 through the form of email communication.

								</p>

								<p>

									With respect to email: The only way a

									visitor will be added to our email distribution list is by voluntarily

									entering their contact information in one of our site guest or registration

									forms.

								</p>

								<p>

									If a visitor or member does not want

									to receive e-mail from us in the future, they simply need to click the

									unsubscribe link found in any email they receive from us.  Additionally

									they can let us know by sending an email to the above address or writing

									to us at the above address.

								</p>

								<p>

									With respect to cookies: We use cookies

									to record user-specific information on which page users access or visit,

									and record past activity at a site in order to provide better service

									when visitors return to our site. Customize Web page content based on

									visitors' browser type or other information the visitor sends.

								</p>

								<p>

									If you supply us with your postal address

									on-line you will only receive the information for which you provided

									us your address.

								</p>

								<p>

									Persons who supply us with their telephone

									numbers on-line will only receive telephone contact from us for which

									you provided us your phone number.

								</p>

								<p>

									With respect to Ad Servers: We do not

									partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies.

								</p>

								<p>With respect to security: We take every

									precaution to protect our Subscribers and Members information.  <br>

								</p>

								<p>

									When Subscribers and Members submit sensitive

									information via this Web Site, their information is protected both online

									and off-line.  When our registration/order forms ask Subscribers and

									Members to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number,

									billing information, etc.), that information is encrypted and is protected

									using industry standard encryption software (128 bit secure socket layers

									protocols).

								</p>

								<p>

									While we use SSL encryption protocols

									to protect sensitive information online, we also employ security measures

									to protect Subscribers and Members information off-line.  All of our

									Subscriber and Member information, not just the sensitive information

									mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need

									the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally

									identifiable information.  Finally, the servers that store personally

									identifiable information are in a secure environment.

									If you feel this site is not following its stated information policy,

									you may contact us at the above addresses.

								</p>

								<p>If you have any questions or concerns

									regarding any of these policies please don't hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:support@give1get4.net" target="_blank" style="color: #000;">support@give1get4.net</a>.</p>
