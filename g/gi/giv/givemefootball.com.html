        &nbsp;<br>
        </span><span class="content">The PFA and its client advertisers/sponsors 
        consider Internet user privacy to be of paramount importance. The information 
        below outlines The PFA's commitment to protecting users' privacy and to 
        ensuring the Internet's integrity. </span> 
        <p class="content"> In the course of delivering an ad to you, we do not 
          collect any personally-identifiable information about you (e.g. names, 
          addresses, etc.). Therefore, we have none to sell, rent, or give away 
          to third parties. The information we collect includes ads served to 
          and clicked on by users. We also collect data indicating whether or 
          not a user visits specific pages of a client advertiser's Web site (e.g. 
          a registration or checkout page). This information is useful only to 
          the specific advertiser who commissioned us to deliver its ads, and 
          only in the context of creative selection and effectiveness reporting. 
          In the unlikely event that a third party gained access to user numbers 
          and non-personally identifiable information, this data would be meaningless 
          and useless.</p>
        <p class="content">The Site uses cookies for collecting user information 
          and the data collected in this way may be processed in the same way 
          as other data submitted to The Professional Footballers Association 
          (and outlined above) and for the same purposes. In addition, The PFA 
          may combine this information with other users' information and review 
          it in an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view 
          a specific type of ad or visit a particular kind of website. The PFA 
          stores a random user number in a "cookie" on each user's computer. 
          The PFA cookie stored on a user's hard drive only contains a random 
          user number (most of the sites you visit use some form of cookie). Cookies 
          are not programs and cannot cause damage to your system.<br>
          <br>
          The PFA uses this number to track advertising effectiveness and the 
          Fans Player Awards voting entries. Cookies help deliver personalized 
          browsing. One example of this is measuring ad frequency; this helps 
          us ensure that a user is not bombarded with the same creative over and 
          over again. Another example where a cookie benefits the user is when 
          a regular participant in the Fans Player Awards does not have to complete 
          the registration form every month.<br>
          In some cases, as per the PFA Fans Player Awards, you may voluntarily 
          provide personal information in response to a specific ad (this ad may 
          ask you to fill out a survey or provide for example your post code). 
          If this does occur, The PFA may collect this information on its own 
          behalf or on behalf of an advertiser. In this case the following applies.<br>
          <br>
