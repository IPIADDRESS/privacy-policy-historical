        <p class="newsheadwhite"><span class="newscopy">The PFA and its client 
          advertisers/sponsors consider Internet user privacy to be of paramount 
          importance. The information below outlines The PFA's commitment to protecting 
          users' privacy and to ensuring the Internet's integrity. <br>
          The PFA does not know the name, phone number or home address of individuals 
          to whom we deliver advertisements on the Internet. The identities of 
          all users who see an ad from a The PFA server/client remain completely 
          anonymous to us. <br>
          In the course of delivering an ad to you, we do not collect any personally-identifiable 
          information about you (e.g. names, addresses, etc.). Therefore, we have 
          none to sell, rent, or give away to third parties. The information we 
          collect includes ads served to and clicked on by users. We also collect 
          data indicating whether or not a user visits specific pages of a client 
          advertiser's Web site (e.g. a registration or checkout page). This information 
          is useful only to the specific advertiser who commissioned us to deliver 
          its ads, and only in the context of creative selection and effectiveness 
          reporting. In the unlikely event that a third party gained access to 
          user numbers and non-personally identifiable information, this data 
          would be meaningless and useless.<br>
          The Site uses cookies for collecting user information and the data collected 
          in this way may be processed in the same way as other data submitted 
          to The Professional Footballers Association (and outlined above) and 
          for the same purposes. In addition, The PFA may combine this information 
          with other users' information and review it in an aggregate form to 
          understand the type of individuals who view a specific type of ad or 
          visit a particular kind of website. The PFA stores a random user number 
          in a "cookie" on each user's computer. A The PFA cookie stored 
          on a user's hard drive only contains a random user number (most of the 
          sites you visit use some form of cookie). Cookies are not programs and 
          cannot cause damage to your system. The PFA uses this number to track 
          advertising effectiveness. One example of this is measuring ad frequency; 
          this helps us ensure that a user is not bombarded with the same creative 
          over and over again. While we believe that cookies enhance the Web experience 
          for the user by limiting the repetitiveness of advertising and increasing 
          the level of relevant content on the Web, they are not essential to 
          our delivering the Internet's most effective advertising. If you do 
          not want the benefits of allowing cookies to be stored on your computer 
          please block all cookies by globally or selectively disabling cookie 
          use in the browser configuration <br>
          In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response 
          to a specific ad (this ad may ask you to fill out a survey or provide 
          for example your post code). If this does occur, The PFA may collect 
          this information on its own behalf or on behalf of an advertiser. In 
          this case the following applies.<br>
          1. The Professional Footballers Association is registered under, and 
          will process your personal data in accordance with, data protection
