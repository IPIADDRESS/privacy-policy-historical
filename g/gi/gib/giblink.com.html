If you have any questions or comments regarding our privacy policy or its enforcement, please feel free to contact administrator.</div><div class="create_bar" style="clear: both"><br>gibLink is an online social networking community that connects people through their personal networks and allows them to meet others, find jobs, roommates, buy and sell goods, and perform other transactions. Members create their own profiles, and those profiles are then shown to other members of this site.<br><br>gibLink collects information our users submit to us such as their name and e-mail address to allow us to identify users and notify them of changes or updates to our service. We also collect personal information submitted by our users in filling out their profile on the service such as gender, location, age, etc. We collect this personal information when our users: sign up as a member; make changes to their member profile information; and send e-mail messages. Members may choose to provide additional information beyond their basic profile for their other profile sections. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables our users to better identify each other and more effectively connect and interact with their network.<br><br>Like many other Web sites, gibLink uses a standard technology called "cookies." Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive - not on our site. They can help make the Internet experience quicker and more convenient. Cookies allow our users to login without entering their ID and password each time they use gibLink. Members who disable cookies will not be able to use gibLink.<br><br>Email address and full name are displayed only when a user invites a friend via email to join the service, when a user requests to add another user to their gibLink list, and when we send notifications to a user related to their use of the service. Except when members invite friends, full names are not shared or displayed with people outside of their Personal Network. Email addresses of gibLink members are never displayed to other users on the system. Users within a Personal Network communicate on gibLink with each other through the gibLink service without disclosing their email addresses.<br>We will not sell, lease or exchange your personal data to third parties without first obtaining your express consent, unless required by law or to protect your membership. <br><br>If you use our Invite feature to invite a friend to our service, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We'll automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join your Personal Network, as well as two reminder messages. gibLink does not sell these email addresses or use them to transmit any communication other than the invitation and reminders to join your personal Network. gibLink stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this invitation and reminders, and for tracking the success of our Invite functionality.<br><br>The gibLink site may contain links to other Web sites. Please be aware that gibLink is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites our users choose to visit. If our users provide any information directly to parties other than gibLink, different rules may apply to the use or disclosure of the personal information disclosed. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing your personal information to third parties.<br><br>Please be aware that whenever members voluntarily disclose personal information online - e.g., message boards, file uploads, events, and classifieds - that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others. By posting personal information online in public forums, members may receive unsolicited messages from other parties.</div></div></td>
