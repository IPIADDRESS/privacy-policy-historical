      <p>Ten Times Ten, LLC (“Ten Times Ten/Girl Rising,” “we,” “our,” “us”) respects your privacy. This policy describes how we collect, use, and share information related to you.</p>

<p><strong>Global Internet Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>It is our policy commitment to be transparent about our practices.   This commitment reflects the value we place on earning and keeping the trust of our activists, users, viewers, employees, nonprofit and business partners and others who share their personal information with us.</p>

<p>This Global Internet Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) describes how we collect, use, and share information when you access the websites, mobile applications, or other online services that we own or operate and that link to this policy (collectively, the “Services”). As used in this Policy, the term “personal information” means information that may directly  identify you personally such as name, address, telephone number, email address, etc. As used in this Policy, the term “aggregate information” means non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about visitors, including but not limited to age, gender, frequency of visits to the Services, parts of the Services most frequently accessed, search terms entered, browser type, IP address, etc. Aggregate information is reviewed and analyzed on a collective basis and will not be linked to the identity of any individual person.
By accessing the Services, you agree to be bound by the Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Services. Each time you use the Services, the current version of the Policy will apply. Accordingly, when you use the Services, you should check the Effective Date of this Policy (which appears at the end of the document) and review any changes since the last version.

This information typically includes, but is not limited to,  the IP address of your Internet service provider, the type of device you use to access the Services, the name of your operating system (such as Macintosh or Windows) and the name and version of your browser (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox). The information we receive depends on the settings on your web browser, device or application.   We and our service providers may collect information over time and across different websites when you use the Online Services. Information Collected By Placing a “Cookie” On Your Computer We may collect information by installing a “tag” or similar technology on your device. These technologies are often called “cookies.” Our websites use cookies to collect statistical information about the ways visitors use our Services – which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page. We analyze this information (known as “clickstream data”) in statistical form to better understand our visitors’ interests and needs to improve the content and functionality of our websites.  We may also use information collected via cookies to deliver ads based on your use of the Services .
