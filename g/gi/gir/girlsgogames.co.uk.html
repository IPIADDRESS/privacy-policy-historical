        <strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This privacy policy (hereafter referred to as the "Privacy Policy") is applicable to our websites and to all games and other activities that we provide
        on or through our websites. (Our websites, all the web pages that are part of the websites and such games and activities are hereafter collectively
        referred to as the "Websites.") SPIL GAMES BV, having its registered office at Arendstraat 23, 1223 RE, Hilversum, The Netherlands (hereafter referred
        to as "SPIL"), is the responsible party as referred to in the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act (<em>Wet Bescherming Persoonsgegevens</em>). SPIL may
        use the services of affiliates or reputable third parties to process personal data collected on or through the Websites. By using or accessing our
        Websites, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>    <br><br>
    <p>
        <strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>
        <strong>About Our Websites</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Websites offer a diverse, current and exciting mix of online games created by SPIL, as well as games created by independent
        developers and SPIL partners. Players can access our Websites to play games without registering, but they can also choose to register to create a
        public or semi-public profile and to save games, high scores and comments on this profile. Visitors to the Websites will also be able to rate games and
        browse for any newly added, top-rated and most popular games.   <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>
        <strong>The Information We Collect</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The information our Websites collect includes the following:
    </p>       <br>
    <p>
        <strong>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>
        <strong>IP address, Cookies and Web Beacons</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; When you visit our Websites, our servers automatically save your computer's IP address. IP addresses will be collected along with
        information about the actual web pages that you visit on the Websites. If you arrive at the Websites via a link from another website, the URL of the
        linking website and the URL of any website that you link to next will also be collected.  <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we use "cookies" to store certain information gained from your browser. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's
        computer and is linked to information about the user. SPIL may use cookies, web beacons (web bugs) or similar technologies to enhance and personalise
        your experience on the Websites, to, among others:   <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        (a) operate and improve products and services on the Websites;
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) help authenticate you when you are on the Websites;
    </p>
    <p>
        (c) remember your preferences and registration information, as applicable;
    </p>
    <p>
        (d) present and help measure and research the effectiveness of SPIL's services, products, advertisements and email communications; and
    </p>
    <p>
        (e) customise the content and advertisements provided to you through the Websites.     <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; SPIL may also use ad network providers to help present advertisements on the Websites. These ad network providers use cookies, web
        beacons and similar technologies to help present, better target and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements using data gathered over a period
        of time and across their networks of web pages to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their users. SPIL offers some services in
        connection with other websites, and personal information that you provide to these sites may be sent to SPIL to deliver such services. SPIL will
        process this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>                                                                     <br><br>
    <p>
        2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; SPIL may also use third party payment service providers (hereafter referred to as a "PSP"), who provide payment transaction services to
        SPIL to sell products or services through the Websites. When you purchase a product from the Websites (e.g. a virtual game item or a subscription for a
        game download), the information you provide to the PSP is subject to their privacy policies, not ours. You explicitly consent that SPIL may provide
        personal information collected from you to a PSP for the purpose of offering the payment transaction service when you purchase an item from the
        Websites, and that the PSP may use such data for (statistical) analysis of payment transactions. SPIL shall be allowed to notify a PSP regarding a user
        who engages in (or who a party believes has engaged in) any activity that is illegal, that violates any person's rights, or that resulted in such
        user's suspension or termination of use of the Websites.       <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        2.5&nbsp;&nbsp; SPIL may share demographic information (certain anonymous information about you as a user, such as age and country) with certain ad
        network providers to help them deliver more relevant advertisements through their ad networks. The use of cookies, web beacons and similar technologies
        by such third parties as ad network providers will be subject to their own privacy policies, and not this Privacy Policy.   <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        2.6&nbsp;&nbsp; Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can (re)set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie
        is being sent. You can reset your browser to opt not to receive cookies from certain third party advertising networks. However, some features and
        services of the Websites may not function correctly if cookies are disabled.    <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>
        <strong>Personal Data, Including Your Email Address</strong>    <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        2.7&nbsp;&nbsp; You may choose to register with us to gain a better game experience and/or to create a public or semi-public profile to enable you to
        participate in our social gaming network. This includes, for example, overviews of high scores, achievements listings and individual game
        recommendations on the Websites. When you register with us, you provide us with certain personal information, such as a username, your date and month
        of birth and your email address, and any information you disclose may also become publicly accessible. We provide you with privacy settings that
        restrict other users from accessing your information and our network architecture and your privacy settings allow you to make informed choices about
        who has access to your information. We allow you to choose the information you provide to friends and networks through our Websites. If your privacy
        settings permit, other users may be able to view and supplement your profile (i.e. by posting comments).
    </p>         <br><br>
    <p>
        2.8&nbsp;&nbsp; If you decide to disclose information in a public venue or in games, we will consider that information as part of the public domain.
        This information will be accessible to any user who visits the Websites.   <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        2.9&nbsp;&nbsp; We only collect email addresses that are supplied to us directly by you. Your email address will only be used for the following
        purposes:   <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        (i) the promotion of (new) games;
    </p>
    <p>
        (ii) service emails (regarding updates, new design, new features, etc.);
    </p>
    <p>
        (iii) administrative purposes, such as notification of a violation of our <u>Terms of Use;</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        (iv) delivering messages you have allowed us to forward (e.g. from other users in your social network).
    </p>
    <p>
        2.10We will not, without your approval:
    </p>
    <p>
        (a) make your email address visible on the Websites;
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) use your email address for purposes other than those described in article 2.9 hereof;
    </p>
    <p>
        (c) transfer your email address or other personal information to third parties, except in exceptional cases as described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>       <br><br>
    <p>
        <strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>
        <strong>Combination of Personal Data</strong>   
    </p>
    <p>
        2.11To optimise our services and the Websites, and for the purposes mentioned in article 2 above, we reserve the right to combine your personal data
        (including your email address, as applicable) with other information about you which has been collected by or provided to us.  <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>
        <strong>To Whom Does SPIL Provide This Information?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        3.1&nbsp;&nbsp; SPIL may provide information to any party whose services it engages for the purposes of its normal operations (e.g. partners who assist
        us by providing technical or operational facilities for the Websites, etc.). We may also supply information to other parties if we are required to do
        so by law or by a ruling from a court of law. SPIL does not provide personal details to other parties for commercial, advertising or marketing purposes
        unless we have your explicit permission to do so, or if doing so is part of a specific program or operation for which you have registered. In which
        case, you may withdraw your permission at any time.  <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>
        <strong>Why Do We Collect Information?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        4.1&nbsp;&nbsp; We use personal details and other information to maintain the general and personalised content and functionality of the Websites. In
        addition, we use personal details to allow us to comply with your requests so that we can provide you with a service when you use (one of) our
        Websites, and for the purposes set out elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.  <br><br>
    </p>

        <strong>Security</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        6.1&nbsp;&nbsp; You post personal data and any other content on the Websites at your own risk and in accordance with article 7 ("Your
        Responsibilities") of the Terms of Use. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to such personal data and other content, please
        be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you choose to share your profile
        and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that any content you post on the Websites will not be viewed by unauthorised persons. We are
        not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Websites. You understand and acknowledge that, even
        after removal, copies of personal data or content may remain visible in cached and archived pages, and that other users may have copied or stored your
        personal data or content.           <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        6.2&nbsp;&nbsp; We have implemented the appropriate measures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorised access, to maintain data security and to
        correctly use the information we collect online. Your personal data that is visible on the Websites (such as any public comments posted by you and/or
        any data in your profile) are accessible to third parties, and you acknowledge and agree that such third parties are able to copy such information to
        their own websites or to other locations.   <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        6.3&nbsp;&nbsp; Your personal data will only be stored for a period necessary for your use of the Websites for the purposes as described in this
        Privacy Policy.   <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
        7.1&nbsp;&nbsp; Users under the age of 16 will be notified not to submit any personal data without the consent of their parent or legal guardian.

    <p>
        <strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>
        <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        8.1&nbsp;&nbsp; We reserve the right to amend our Privacy Policy. Amendments will be effective from the moment of publication on the Websites, so
        please check the Websites regularly for amendments.    <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        8.2&nbsp;&nbsp; The Internet is a global environment, and using the Internet necessarily involves the collection and processing of personal data on an
        international basis. Therefore, by using (one or more of) our Websites, you acknowledge and agree to our processing your personal data in this way.
    </p>    <br><br>
    <p>
        8.3&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Websites may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage
        users to be aware of this when they leave our site, and to read the privacy statements of any other websites that collect personally identifiable
        information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us.     <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        8.4&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of a transfer of (one of our) Websites to a third party, we may transfer to such third party all personal information that
        we collected about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In this event, users who have provided email addresses to us will be notified when
        information they have supplied about them is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.     <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        8.5&nbsp;&nbsp; We also have Terms of Use that are applicable to your use of the Websites. In the case of a contradiction between the Terms of Use and
        this Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy will prevail.     <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        8.6&nbsp;&nbsp; This Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of The Netherlands and submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in The
        Netherlands.    <br><br>
