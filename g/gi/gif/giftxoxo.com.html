		Cookies</h6>
</div><p></p>
<p>
	The acceptance of cookies is not a requirement for visiting the Site. However we would like to point out that, some functionality on the Site and ordering is only possible with the activation of cookies. A "cookie" is a small piece of information stored by a Web server on a Web browser so it can be later read back from that browser. Cookies are useful for enabling the browser to remember information specific to a given user. Giftxoxo.com places both permanent and temporary cookies in your computer's hard drive. You hereby accept our assurance that Giftxoxo.com's cookies do not contain any of your personally identifiable information and are free from viruses.</p>
<p></p><div class="tabcontent" style="display:block;">
	<h6>
		Sharing of personal information</h6>
</div><p></p>
<p>
	We may share personal information with our other corporate entities and partners to help, detect and prevent identity theft, fraud and other potentially illegal acts; correlate related or multiple accounts to prevent abuse of our services; and to facilitate joint or co-branded services that you request where such services are provided by more than one corporate entity. Those entities may not market to you as a result of such sharing unless you explicitly opt-in.</p>
<p>
	We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process.

When we collect payment card details electronically, we use encryption by using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) coding.

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of your identity before we disclose personal information to you.
