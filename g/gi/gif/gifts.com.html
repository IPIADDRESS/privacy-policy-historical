			registered users and other communications related to the Gifts.com
			service. In order to complete a transaction, Business Partners may collect
			PII of a gift recipient on their respective Web site.
			Such collection of PII is governed by that Business Partner’s privacy policy.
			<br><br>Gifts.com may correlate or match registered users'
			information, including PII, with information held by our Business
			Partners to target ads or otherwise improve the effectiveness of our
			service. Our Business Partners may read or set cookies on your hard
			drive, use pixel tags, track which ads you have viewed, or collect
			other information about you.<br><br>From time to time, Gifts.com may
			also have special offers or promotions that are sponsored by a
			Business Partner. In order to participate in these offers, you may be
			required to follow a separate registration process.  If you consent
			to receive information from a Business Partner through an opt-in or
			opt-out process Gifts.com may pass your information to such Business
			Partner.<br><br>Gifts.com may also offer goods or services for
			purchase available by our Business Partners by way of email
			communications to our users. If you purchase goods or services
			offered through Gifts.com by a Business Partner, then you may be
			required to submit PII in order to complete the transaction and
			Gifts.com may provide your PII to such Business Partner for that
			purpose.<br><br>In some cases, we may enter into a promotional
			relationship with a Business Partner in which we prominently display
			their brand name or trademarks on pages that appear the same as or
			very similar to the pages of the Gifts.com service. These pages are
			known as "Co-Branded Pages" and these particular Business
			Partners are known as “Co-Branded Business Partners.” If
			the page on which you submit information is a Co-Branded Page, or was
			accessed by clicking on a link on a Co-Branded Page, then we may
			share your personal information with the associated Co-Branded
			Business Partner. Co-Branded Business Partners may use your personal
			information in accordance with their own privacy policies. Gifts.com
			disclaims all liability for the privacy policies and procedures on
			any Business Partner or Co-Branded Business Partner Web site. You
			will need to contact the Co-Branded Business Partner to instruct them
			directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal
			information by them. Additionally, you agree that we may use and
			disclose all such information so submitted to such Co-Branded
			Business Partners in the same manner in which we are entitled to use
			and disclose any other information you submit to us (see Use of your
