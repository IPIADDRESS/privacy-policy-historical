		<p align="center"><strong>FAQs for Privacy Policy changes</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Why has the privacy  policy changed?</strong></p>
		<p>We are part of the IAC family of companies, which has grown  in recent years to include over 60 brands.&nbsp;  In order to help visitors and customers clearly understand our data  collection and use practices, IAC has decided to have its businesses follow a  standard set of privacy practices and use a standard format to describe their  privacy practices. We are making these changes to bring our privacy policy in line  with this standard format. </p>
		<p><strong>What changes have  been made to the privacy policy?</strong></p>
		<p>No, our underlying practices have not changed.&nbsp; We have simply reorganized and expanded the  descriptions of our practices in various places to follow the standardized  format that is now used by all IAC businesses. </p>
		<p><strong>Who are the  businesses in the IAC family of companies?</strong></p>
		<p> Our businesses include Ask.com, Citysearch, Evite, LendingTree,  HSN, Match.com, RealEstate.com, ServiceMagic, Ticketmaster, and many  others.&nbsp; For a full list of the IAC  businesses, please visit <a href="javascript:externalPop('http://www.iac.com/')" class="links">www.iac.com</a>.</p>
		<p><strong>Do you/will you sell  my personal information to third parties?</strong></p>
		<p>No, we won’t sell your personal information to third  parties.&nbsp; As described in our privacy policy, we may share your personal information with other IAC businesses and  with selected business partners with which we partner to provide you with  special promotions, offers, sweepstakes, contests or other activities, when you  elect to participate in those offers or promotions.&nbsp; We may also share personal information in  other limited circumstances, including to law enforcement, with your consent or  after providing you with the option of not having such information shared. </p>
		<p><strong>To whom does the updated  privacy policy apply?</strong></p>
		<p>This updated privacy policy applies to all of our website visitors in the United States.&nbsp; It generally covers the personal information visitors provide to us on  this website.</p>
		<p><strong>When do revisions  take effect?</strong></p>
		<p>The updated privacy policy is effective July 18, 2007.&nbsp; It applies to personal information we collect from this date going forward.</p>
		<p><strong>Will this updated policy  apply to the information I have already provided to you?</strong></p>
		<p>No, the new provisions of this updated privacy policy will  not apply to the personal information you have provided before July 18, 2007.&nbsp; If at some time in the future we want to  apply these changes to information we collected about you before this date, we  will notify you and provide you with the opportunity to choose not to have the  changes apply to that previously collected personal information.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
		<p><strong>What are the benefits  of this privacy policy change to me?</strong></p>
		<p>We believe these changes make our privacy policy easier for  our customers to navigate and understand our business practices and the  practices of other businesses within the IAC family. &nbsp;In addition, our ability to share information  with other IAC businesses and business partners will provide our customers with  information about special offers and services that may be of interest to them. &nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>Can I see a copy of  the prior privacy policy?</strong></p>
		<p>Yes, please click <a href="/public/info?file=oldprivacy.html" class="links">here</a> for a link to our previous privacy  policy that applies to personal information collected before July 18, 2007.</p>
