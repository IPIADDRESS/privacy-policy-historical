Thank you for visiting the 1ClickPrizes™ website located at www.1clickprizes.com (the “Website”).

<strong>If you are a resident of the State of California and would like to opt-out from the disclosure of your personal information to any third party for marketing purposes, please e-mail us at: info@1clickprizes.com.  Please be advised that where California residents opt-out from permitting their personal information to be shared, such individuals may still receive selected offers directly from us, in accordance with the law.</strong></p>

We may collect your personally identifiable information when you register for the Toolbar, enter the Promotion and/or request other products and/or services at the Website.  <strong>We may also collect your personally identifiable information when you otherwise agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, but do not complete the applicable registration process in full.</strong>  The types of personally identifiable information that we collect when you register for the Toolbar include, without limitation, your: (a) first name; (b) e-mail address; and (c) any and all other information requested on the applicable Toolbar registration form.

<strong>Use of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>
By submitting your personal information on the Website or otherwise providing same to 1ClickPrizes™, you agree that we may use such personal information (other than your Promotion Data) for any lawful purposes, subject to any restrictions contained herein.  We may sell, rent, lease or otherwise provide the personal information that you supply to us to any third party and we may work with other businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our users.

We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf.

The agents performing these limited functions on our behalf shall have access to our users’ personal information as needed to perform their functions for us, but we do not permit them to use your personal information for other purposes.
</p>
<p>We will also use your personal information for customer service, to provide you with information that you may request, to customize your experience on the Website and/or to contact you when necessary in connection with the Promotion, Toolbar and other transactions entered into by you on the Website or otherwise with 1ClickPrizes™.  We may also use your personal information for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our business.  We may also combine the information we have gathered about you (other than your Promotion Data) with information from other sources.  We may use third parties to help us operate our business and the Website or to administer activities on our behalf.  </p>
<p>We also reserve the right to release current or past user information in the event that we believe that the user is using, or has used, our products, services and/or Website: (i) in violation of the EULA, the Contest Rules (as defined in the EULA), this Privacy Policy or any other of our operating rules, policies, price schedules and other supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be published by us from time to time; (ii) to commit unlawful acts; (iii) if such information is subpoenaed or requested pursuant to a judicial or regulatory proceeding or inquiry; (iv) if we are sold or acquired; and/or (v) when we deem it necessary or appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time, and Federal Trade Commission implementing regulations.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we reserve the right to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute any and all personal information (other than your Promotion Data) with/to any third party for any and all uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and applicable law.  <br>
