<p>Last revised 4/20/2016</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the GiftRocket website (“Website”). GiftRocket, Inc., the provider of the Website (referred to as “us” or “we”), is committed to protecting your privacy online. Please read the following to learn what information we collect from you (the “User” or the “End User”) and how we use that information. If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please email us.</p>
<p>By accessing or using our website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound to the terms of this privacy policy and our website terms of use.</p>
<h3>Changes to privacy policy</h3>
<p>We may change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the revised Privacy Policy in the “Privacy Policy” section of the Website. The revised Privacy Policy is effective immediately when posted on the Website. It is the responsibility of each User to review the Website and the Privacy Policy periodically to learn of any revisions to this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Website after the effectiveness of such revisions will constitute your acknowledgment and acceptance of the terms of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information</h3>
<p>We collect three types of information about our Website Users: Personally Identifiable Information, Non-Personally Identifiable Information, and Information Explicitly Granted by Social Network Platforms</p>
<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific user. When you engage in certain activities on the Website, such purchasing or redeeming a GiftRocket gift from us or our partners, submitting content and/or posting content on our site, entering any contests or sweepstakes sponsored by us or our partners, filling out a survey, sending us or our partners feedback, requesting information about our services, submitting an affiliate agreement, applying for a job, posting a video or signing up for special offers from third parties through the Website (collectively, “Identification Activities”), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, telephone number and date of birth. When you order products or services, we will also ask you to provide us with your credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.</p>
<p>We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide our products and services to you, administer sweepstakes and contests, enhance the operation of the Website, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website use, improve our product and service offerings, and to tailor your experience with third parties as provided in Item 3 of this Privacy Policy. For example, if you send our customer service an email we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about our services, and may post your comment in our marketing materials or on our Website. In addition, if you use our Website to send information or a product to another person, we may store your personal information, and the personal information of any recipient. We use that other person’s contact information to allow him or her to view and accept your gift or to allow the recipient to access the information you requested we send. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, prevent fraud, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.</p>
<h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific End User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are using and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. We, and/or our authorized Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags.</p>
<p>We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.</p>
<h3>Information Explicitly Granted by Social Network Platforms</h3>
<p>If you access GiftRocket’s services on a “social network platform” (including but not limited to Facebook), we will access and store the information explicitly allowed by the social network platform by their Terms of Service, once you allow us to do so, through an interface provided by the social network platform. As we do not have control over the user interface provided by social network platforms, we do not take any responsibility for any changes or problems with the interface or exchange of information provided by any of these social network platforms.</p>
<h3>Release of Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as provided below:</p>
<ul>
<li>We share your information with your specified GiftRocket recipient. We inform provide gift recipients your name, contact information, and personal message.</li>
<li>We may share your information with Authorized Third Party Service Providers. We provide some of our services and products through third parties. These “Third Party Service Providers” perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing our administrative and promotional emails. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, send email, administer contests or sweepstakes, remove repetitive information on customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, process credit card payments, operate the Website, troubleshoot, and provide customer service. We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies (“Affiliates”) with whom we have business relationships and may have to also share their information with Service Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. For example, when you order a GiftRocket, we release your credit card information to our payments providers to confirm payment for our service. Likewise, we may release an Affiliate’s information to our payment providers to send out a payment. We encourage GiftRocket Third Party Service Providers to adopt and post privacy policies as well. While we make a conscious effort to make sure we work with parties who share the same concern for your privacy that we do, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control</li>
<li>We may share your information in a Business Transfer. As with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection of Others. We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or a court order; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Website Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of the Website, its Users or others.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Partners, Affiliates and Advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information (which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information) with “Third Party Advertisers” or “Third Party Advertising Companies” and other parties as provided below.</p>
<p>
We use Third Party Advertising Companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide, through the use of network tags, advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Some of these Third Party Advertising Companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). If you would like more information about any NAI member company, or you would like to opt-out of targeted advertising from any NAI member company, click here:
<span class="long_link">
http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp
</span>
</p>
<p>We also use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our Users to administer our Website and constantly improve its quality. We may also publish this information for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for Advertisers. Please note that this is not Personally Identifiable Information, only general summaries of the activities of our Users. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned and used by us.</p>
<p>We may also share your Personally Identifiable or Non-Personally Identifiable information under certain circumstances without your consent, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>To enforce our Terms of Service;</li>
<li>To comply with legal requirements including but not limited to court order or subpoena or to prevent or investigate suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Service, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or may expose us to legal liability we may, without your consent, access and disclose your information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you or your account;</li>
<li>To provide information to trusted businesses or persons for the sole purpose of processing personally identifying information; and</li>
<li>With trusted third parties that provide services on our behalf or with whom we have collaborated to offer a particular service. We reserve the right to add, remove or change our business partners from time to time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Updating and Correcting Information</h3>
<p>We believe that you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable Information you provide us. You may change any of your Personally Identifiable Information by sending us an email at support@giftrocket.com. Please indicate your name, address and email address, and what information you would like to update when you contact us.</p>
<p>We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on the Website. In addition, in may be impossible for us to completely delete all of your information because we periodically backup information.</p>
<h3>User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</h3>
<p>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although it may be required to engage in a certain activity on the Website.</p>
<p>As a condition of purchase of our products and services, we will send you Administrative and Promotional emails. We will send you information regarding your account activity and purchases as well as updates about our products and promotional offers. You cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails. “Administrative Emails” relate to a User’s activity on the Website, and include emails regarding a particular User’s account, requests or inquiries, and purchases of products and services. In contrast to Administrative Emails, however, you do have a choice with respect to Promotional Emails. Promotional Emails advertise our products and services, including exclusive sales and other offers, and/or the products and services of our Advertisers and Affiliates. If you do not want to receive Promotional Emails from us, you may elect to opt-out of receiving Promotional Emails at any time after registering by e-mailing us at support@giftrocket.com, by writing to us at the address contained herein, or by hitting the “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of any of our Promotional E-mails. When contacting us, please indicate your name, email address, and which Promotional Emails you do not want to receive.</p>
<h3>Security of information</h3>
<p>We take security seriously and take numerous precautions to protect the security of Personally Identifiable Information. Your Personally Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have access to. We encrypt certain sensitive information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information is safe as it is transmitted to us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Website, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.</p>
<h3>Data Tracking</h3>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>To facilitate and customize your experience with the Website, we store cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a User’s computer for record-keeping purposes which contains information about that User. We use cookies to save you time while using the Website, remind us who you are, and track and target User interests in order to provide a customized experience. Cookies also allow us to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from you, like which pages you visited and what links you clicked on. Use of this information helps us to create a more user-friendly experience for all visitors. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser settings to decline cookies. Please note that if you decline or delete these cookies, some parts of the Website may not work properly.</p>
<h4>Other Tracking Devices</h4>
<p>We may use other industry standard technologies like pixel tags and web beacons to track your use of our Website pages and promotions, or we may allow our Third Party Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf. Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our Website, or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate a Non-Personally Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Website, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and web beacons provided by our Affiliates and/or Marketing Partners for the same purposes.</p>
<h3>Privacy Policies of Third Party Websites</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other websites that may be accessible through this Website have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. If you link to any such website, we urge you review the website’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.</p>
<p>Notice of Privacy Rights to California Residents. California law requires that we provide you with a summary of your privacy rights under the California Online Privacy Protection Act (the “Act”) and the California Business and Professions Code. As required by the Act, we will provide you with the categories of Personally Identifiable Information that we collect through the Website and the categories of third party persons or entities with whom such Personally Identifiable Information may be shared for direct marketing purposes at your request. California law requires us to inform you, at your request, (1) the categories of Personally Identifiable Information we collect and what third parties we share that information with; (2) the names and addresses of those third parties; and (3) examples of the products marketed by those companies. The Act further requires us to allow you to control who you do not want us to share that information with. To obtain this information, please send a request by email to support@giftrocket.com. When contacting us, please indicate your name, email address, city and state (to confirm you are a California Resident), and what Personally Identifiable Information you do not want us to share with Affiliated Businesses or Marketing Partners. Please label your request “California Customer Choice Notice.” Please allow 30 days for a response. Also, please note that there is no charge for controlling the sharing of your Personally Identifiable Information or requesting this notice.</p>
<h3>In summary</h3>
<p>GiftRocket cares a lot about your privacy, and will go to great lengths to protect it. The information collected from our Site helps us better understand our market and consumer interests. This allows us to serve our customers and business associates with the level of satisfaction they deserve.</p>
