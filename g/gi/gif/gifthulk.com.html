<p dir="LTR">By using GiftHulk.com or creating a member account, you consent to the data practices prescribed in this Privacy Policy. The Company’s Privacy Policy governs the privacy guidelines for the GiftHulk.com. Please note that this policy applies only to the GiftHulk.com sites, and not to the sites of other companies or organizations to which we provide links.</p>
<p dir="LTR"><strong>General</strong></p>
<p dir="LTR">GiftHulk collects limited non-personally identifying information and records information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, the date and time of your query, GiftHulk cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services.</p>
<p dir="LTR"><strong>User personal information</strong></p>
<p dir="LTR">“Personal Information” means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number, or other contact information, whether at work or at home.</p>
<p dir="LTR">In a few areas on our website, in providing services and through online customer support tools, we may ask you to provide Personal Information that will enable us to enhance your use of the website or for purposes such as facilitating correspondence with you, registering your entitlement to access certain special features of the website, or to complete transactions. It is always your choice whether or not to provide that Personal Information. If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you may not be able to use certain features of the website.</p>
<p dir="LTR">For example, when you use the referral features of the website (the “Referral Program”), we may ask you to provide information such as your email address and your user and/or password information at another website or service. This will allow us to access your online address book, which includes your friends’ email addresses, so that we can send email invitations to them on your behalf. You will be able to choose who we send invitations to and we never store the login information you provide. When your friends receive an invitation you initiated, they will be given the opportunity to become Members, and make referrals to their friends also. If the people you invited to the service do not respond to the initial invitation request, we will attempt to send them additional invitations sometime in the future. We do this because sometimes the initial attempts are not delivered to their inbox and so they never actually saw the initial invitations. We may use the data we collect in connection with these communications for the operation and ongoing maintenance of the Referral Program and the services we offer through the website.</p>
<p dir="LTR">We may also automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, which could include your IP address, cookie information, browser information, and the page you request.</p>
<p dir="LTR">Except as described in this policy, the Personal Information you provide will be kept confidential and used to support your customer relationship with the Company. Among other things, we want to help you quickly find information on our website and alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new products and services from the Company. The Company may enhance or merge your information with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you.</p>
<p dir="LTR">Periodically, we may send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. These mailings may be sent electronically or in physical form. Only the Company (or agents or contractors working on behalf of the Company and under confidentiality agreements, or other Members) will send you these mailings. You can opt-out of receiving further marketing from the Company by following the instructions in the Opt-out paragraph in this Privacy Policy, below.</p>
<p dir="LTR"><strong>Updating your personal information</strong></p>
<p dir="LTR">To update any of your personal information or to change any of your marketing preferences, you may update your personal information through the website by logging in and accessing the “My Profile” area.</p>
<p dir="LTR"><strong>Support and Contact</strong></p>
<p dir="LTR">If you contact GiftHulk, we may keep a record of that correspondence and we may collect your email address for archival purposes but will not use, transfer or sell your email address.</p>
<p dir="LTR"><strong>Third-party information gathering</strong></p>
<p dir="LTR">The GiftHulk website contains links to other sites on the Web. Please be aware that GiftHulk is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by GiftHulk.</p>
<p dir="LTR"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p dir="LTR">GiftHulk.com may set and access cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small data file that a Web site may send to your browser and which may then be stored on your system. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For the session cookie, once you close the browser, the cookie terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. We use cookie and web beacon technology to track which pages on the GiftHulk.com Site our visitors view and which Web browsers our visitors use.</p>
<p dir="LTR">Cookies help us track your responses to our market research surveys, to record statistics behind special offers, however, we will never share such personally identifiable information with third parties except as set forth below under “Sharing.”</p>
<p dir="LTR"><strong>Sharing</strong></p>
<p dir="LTR">Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law, where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding or administrative legal, a criminal investigation, a court order, or legal process served on our Web site. We may also share your personal information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of GiftHulk.com, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p dir="LTR"><strong>Business Transitions</strong></p>
<p dir="LTR">In the event GiftHulk.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred, unless such a transfer will violate state or federal law.</p>
<p dir="LTR"><strong>Opt-Out</strong></p>
<p dir="LTR">You may unsubscribe from offers and other communications from the Company by following the instructions that we include at the end of every mailing or by emailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:contact@gifthulk.com">contact@gifthulk.com</a>. We will process your request for removal within 10 business days, although we attempt to process it within 24 hours.</p>
