<h2>What Personal Customer Information Does Giftcardrescue.com Collect?</h2>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide Giftcardrescue.com’s visitors with superior online experience.

<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>In order to process your orders placed on this website, you must first complete the registration form.
