                <h4>Fair Information Practices</h4>

                <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and
                    the
                    concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws
                    around
                    the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented
                    is
                    critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

                <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
                    should a data breach occur:</p>

                </ul>

                <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have a right to
                    pursue
                    legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
                    This
                    principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also
                    that
                    individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute
                    non-compliance by data processors.</p>
