		<p><b><a name="one"></a>What personally identifiable information is collected from me?</b></p>
		<p>GIST Communications, which operates the Internet site located at www.gist.com, 
		   recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable 
  		   information collected about visitors to our site. As a general policy, no personally 
		   identifiable information, such as your name, address or email address, is automatically 
		   collected from visitors to our site. Personally identifiable information about 
		   visitors to our sites is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. 
		   We may collect certain non-personal information to optimize our web pages for 
		   your computer (i.e., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating 
		   system you use, and the domain name of your Internet service provider). We may 
   		   use such non-personal information for internal purposes, including but not limited 
		   to improving the content of our sites. In those instances when we do collect 
		   personally identifiable information, GIST will notify you when we are collecting 
		   personally identifiable information about you. For example, we may need to collect 
		   such information to fulfill your registration, in connection with contest entry 
		   forms, or in connection with community postings such as chat and bulletin boards.

		</p><hr>
		<p><b><a name="two"></a>How is my information used?</b></p>
		<p>Personally identifiable information that visitors submit to the GIST site 
		   is used only for the purpose for which it is submitted unless we disclose other 
		   uses in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection. Such other uses may 
		   include sending you information or materials we think you will find interesting 
		   or sharing the information with GIST's advertisers and business partners, who 
		   use the information for marketing and promotional purposes. However, at the 
		   time of collection, you will have the option of instructing us not to send you 
		   additional information or share your personal information with third parties. 
		   GIST is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of our advertisers 
		   or business partners. GIST may also use third parties to manage sweepstakes, 
		   contests or chats, and these parties may have access to personally identifiable 
		   information submitted by visitors who participate in those activities. GIST 
		   instructs these third parties to use personally identifiable information only 
		   for the specific purpose for which it is collected, and not to sell, market 
		   or transfer such information to other entities. GIST may use personally identifiable 
		   information in aggregate form to make our site better and more responsive to 
		   the needs of our visitors. This statistical compilation of non-identifiable 
		   information may also be used by GIST or provided to others for marketing, advertising 
		   or research purposes. Visitors to our sites will be able to instruct us not 
		   to include their personal information in our aggregate database by e-mail request 
		   or by modifying online registrations. GIST maintains appropriate safeguards 
		   to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personally identifiable information 
		   submitted to our sites, and periodically reviews and updates its security measures 
		   in light of current technologies. </p>

		<p> <b><a name="three"></a>What are cookies and how are they used by GIST?</b></p>
		<p>Cookies are data that a web site transfers to an individual's hard-drive for 
		   record-keeping purposes. Cookies, which are an industry standard used by most 
		   web sites, including those operated by GIST, can facilitate a user's ongoing 
		   access to and use of a site. They aid the function of this web site by matching 
		   users with stored information in our database to provide personalized TV listings. 
		   The Cookie itself does not contain any personally identifiable information. 
		   If a user does not want information collected through the use of Cookies, there 
   		   is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept 
 		   the Cookie feature. But users should note that Cookies may be necessary to provide 
 		   the user with such special features as customized content delivery. </p>

		<p><b><a name="four"></a>What do I need to know about linking to Third Party and Co-Branded sites?</b></p>
		<p>GIST has established relationships that allow visitors to our Internet site 
 		   to link directly to sites operated by third parties. Some of these sites may 
  		   be "co-branded" with a GIST logo; however, they are not operated or maintained 
  		   by GIST. GIST chooses its advertisers and business partners carefully. However, 
     	   GIST is not responsible for the content or practices of web sites operated by 
  		   third parties that are linked to our site. These links are meant for the user's 
  		   convenience only. Links to third party sites do not constitute sponsorship, 
 		   endorsement or approval by GIST of the content, policies or practices of such 
		   third party sites. Once you have left the GIST site via such a link, you should 
		   check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site. This site may also 
		   be linked to websites operated by companies affiliated with GIST. Visitors to 
		   those sites should refer to their separate privacy policies and practices. </p>
