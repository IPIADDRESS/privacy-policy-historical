<li><span>The transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between you and us as the data controller or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at your request.</span></li>
<li><span>The transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in your interests between us as the data controller and another natural or legal person.</span></li>

<p>9-DATA SECURITY</p>
<div id="exp-17793" class="expand-body expanded">
<p class="NormalSpaced"><span>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</span></p>
<p class="NormalSpaced"><span>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</span></p>
<p class="NormalSpaced"><span>10-</span>DATA RETENTION</p>
<div id="exp-17794" class="expand-body expanded">
<p><strong>How long will you use my personal data for?</strong></p>
<p><span>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</span></p>
<p><span>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see&nbsp;below for further information.</span></p>
<p><span>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</span></p>
<p><span>11-</span>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</p>
<div id="exp-17795" class="expand-body expanded">
<p><span>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><span>Request access to your personal data:&nbsp;</span></em></strong>You have the right to access your personal data (known as an “access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To make a request:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>If you wish to make a request for access to your information, please contact us at GUS UK Management Limited<span>&nbsp;</span><span>30 Holborn, London, EC1N 2LX</span><span>&nbsp;</span>or by email at<span>&nbsp;</span>dataprotection@gus.global;</p>
<p><strong>No fee usually required:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights), although we have the right to charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>What we may need from you:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p><strong>Time limit to respond:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month<span>&nbsp;</span><span>from the date your access request is received</span>. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p><strong><em><span>Request correction of your personal data</span></em></strong></p>
<p>This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><span>Request erasure of your personal data</span></em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><span>Object to processing of your personal data</span></em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You may raise an objection to the processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><span>Request restriction of processing your personal data</span></em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You may request to restrict our processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><span>Request the transfer of your personal data</span></em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span>You may exercise your right to transfer&nbsp;</span>your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><span>Right to withdraw consent</span></em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This applies only where we rely on your consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, you can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also contact us at info@interactivepro.org.uk if you wish to exercise your rights.</p>
<p><span>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our DPO.</span></p>
<p><span>12-GLOSSARY</span></p>
<p><strong>LAWFUL BASIS</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Legitimate Interest</span></strong><span>&nbsp;means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting our DPO.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Performance of Contract</span></strong><span>&nbsp;means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take preliminary pre-contractual steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation</span></strong><span>&nbsp;means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.</span></p>
