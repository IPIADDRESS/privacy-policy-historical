				<p>Read the official blog <a href="http://googlevoiceblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/google-welcomes-gizmo5.html">post</a> for more information.</p><br><br>

				<h2>Privacy Policy - Service and Site</h2><br>
				<p>This privacy policy is designed to assist you in understanding how Gizmo5 Technologies, Inc. the creator, operator and owner of Gizmo5 ("Gizmo5") use and safeguards Information and resources you provide in using Software and Services.<br><br></p><p>

</p><p></p><h4>Explanation of Service</h4>
Gizmo5 provides the Software (Software) and manages operations of the Gizmo5 Services (Services). Software is provided to all users for free but some services may require registration in order to function. Other services may require a paid subscription to Gizmo5.<br><br><p>
</p><p>Through these services, you can register to become a user of the Gizmo5 Services and communicate with other Gizmo5 users through voice communication and/or other forms of communication. You also have the option of sharing your personal profile with other users of the Software. You can also search for other users and add them to your phonebook. You can also approve or disapprove requests from other users who wish to add you to their phonebook, whereby those users will be able to see your online status. You can also invite others to download Software and register as a Gizmo5 user. From time to time, new services may be added which improve, modify or extend the functionality of the Service.<br><br></p><p>

</p><p></p><h4>Use of Information</h4>

Gizmo5 DOES NOT SELL, RENT, LOAN, TRADE, LEASE OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH SOFTWARE OR SERVICE TO ANY THIRD PARTY OUTSIDE THE Gizmo5 NETWORK, WHICH NETWORK INCLUDES OUR TRUSTED PARTNERS.  Gizmo5 MAY ENGAGE A THIRD PARTY IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT Gizmo5'S COMMUNICATION AND/OR MARKETING ON Gizmo5'S BEHALF AND UNDER Gizmo5'S RESPONSIBILITY. Gizmo5 WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THE NETWORK TO OTHER USERS IN THE NETWORK ONLY WITH YOUR EXPLICIT PERMISSION AS GRANTED BY YOU THROUGH APPLICABLE SETTINGS AVAILABLE IN THE SOFTWARE. <br><br><p>
</p><p>In the event that Gizmo5 and/or its units or subsidiaries are ever sold, acquired, merged, liquidated, reorganized, or otherwise transferred, Gizmo5 reserves the right to transfer its user databases together with any personally identifiable information contained therein, to a third-party acquiring Gizmo5.s assets. In the event Gizmo5 does so, it will place a prominent notice of the sale on the homepage of its corporate website, with links to information as to how you can change your privacy preferences.<br><br></p><p>

</p><p></p><h4>What Information Do You Provide to us and How Do We Use it?</h4>
When you use the Gizmo5 Services and Software you provide three types of Information: (1) Personal Information you actively choose to disclose to the Gizmo5 Network (Active Information), (2) Usage Information that is provided passively or generated automatically during your use of Software (Passive Information) and (3) information that you share or communicate with other Software users (User Information).<br><br><p>

This includes your Gizmo5 Name and password. Active information may also include any billing information you submit only if you decide to purchase Services from Gizmo5. </p><p>
</p><p>If you choose to invite a friend to join Gizmo5 through either a menu option in the software or facilities available at the website www.Gizmo5.com and related pages, you will be directed to a web page and will have the possibility of adding one or more email addresses in an online form. Any information entered in this form is used to send the content to those specified email addresses. Additional terms and policies may apply for sending invitations.

Gizmo5 reserves the right to utilize this information for marketing purposes, for instance by displaying selected comments on its website or in other communications. <br><br></p><p>
</p><p>From time to time, Gizmo5 may send you surveys or solicit your feedback. Gizmo5 uses surveys to gauge user interest in new products and premiums it may offer. Gizmo5 will ask for your feedback on site features. Gizmo5 will use the information it gathers to improve its sites and provide a more meaningful experience for its users. Gizmo5 may also use the information to alert you to offers and products of Gizmo5 in which you have expressed an interest.<br><br></p><p>
</p><p>User Information may be required by certain Gizmo5 Services in order for the Software to function as intended and, if so desired, for other users of the Software to communicate with you.
