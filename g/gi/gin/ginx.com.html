<h2>Ginx Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>This policy tells you how we use and protect your personal information on 
   http://ginx.com.  This policy is effective as of January 12, 2009.</p>

<div class="policy">

<h3>Information We Collect</h3>

<p>
    <strong>No Information Required.</strong> There may be limited parts of 
    our site that you may use without telling us who you are or revealing any 
    information about yourself.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Information We Collect Upon Registration.</strong> In order to 
    use certain parts of our site we require that you provide us with some 
    basic personal information such as your Twitter user name, and Twitter 
    password.  We need your Twitter username and password because Twitter 
    requires that we authenticate your Twitter credentials in order to send &amp; 
    receive information to Twitter on your behalf.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Information We Collect From Twitter.</strong>  If you give us your 
    Twitter username and password, we can and do access the information in your 
    Twitter account as allowed according to the Twitter API.  We do this in order 
    to provide functionality for the Ginx service.  This information may include 
    Twitter messages you have sent, Twitter messages posted by people you’re 
    following, your direct messages, and public profile information (e.g., name, 
    username, full name, time zone, URL information, one-line bio, location, 
    language, photo).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Optional Information.</strong>  You may have the opportunity to 
    provide us with additional, optional information about yourself. You may 
    choose to do this because it enhances the Ginx experience for you and/or 
    other Ginx users.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Log Data.</strong>  We may record some or all of the information 
    your browser sends to our servers.  This may include information such as 
    your IP address, the domain you are visiting from, your browser type, the 
    pages you visit on our site, and terms you may have searched for. We use this 
    information to monitor and improve the technical performance of our site and 
    to improve the overall Ginx service.
</p>

<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>

<p>
    Our primary purpose in collecting and using your personal information is 
    to provide you with a safe, efficient, and customized experience.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Interacting with Twitter.</strong>  As noted above, we use your Twitter 
    username and password to send information to and receive information from 
    Twitter on your behalf. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Communication.</strong>  If you provide us your personal contact 
    information on Ginx (e.g., email, phone number) we may use it to provide you 
    Ginx functionality, market to you, and/or provide you information about the 
    Ginx service.  If you do not wish to receive such communication or information 
    from us, please unsubscribe using the instructions provided in the communication.  
    We may also send messages to your Twitter or Ginx account just like any other 
    user of the Twitter or Ginx services.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Improving our Service.</strong>  We may use personal information to 
    better understand user behavior, and research &amp; analysis in order to operate 
    and improve the Ginx service.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Aggregated Non-Personal Information.</strong>  We may share aggregated 
    non-personal information with third parties.  
</p>

<p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent.</p>

<h3>How We Protect Your Information</h3>

<p>
    We understand that you are trusting us with the personal information you share 
    with us.  We take this very seriously and treat your information as an asset that 
    must be protected.  Your information is stored on our servers located in the 
    United States.  We use tools (encryption, passwords, etc.) to protect your personal 
    information against unauthorized access and disclosure.  However, despite our best 
    efforts, there may be third parties that try to hack into our systems or intercept 
    our data communications. Therefore, although we will work very hard to protect 
    your personal information, we cannot guarantee that that your personal information 
    or private communications will remain private 100% of the time.
</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>
    In order to improve the Ginx service and your experience, we use “cookie” technology.  
    A cookie is a small file placed on your hard drive that can be used to do things such 
    as: help us better understand how people use our service, remember your settings when 
    you when you repeatedly visit our site, and let you customize your Ginx experience.  
    A few additional things you might want to know about cookies:
    </p><ul>
        <li>You can adjust your cookie settings in your browser (and may turn off cookies entirely)</li>
        <li>There are certain features that are only available through the use of cookies</li>
        <li>We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information</li>
    </ul>
<p></p>


<h3>Our Disclosure of Your Information</h3>

<p>
    We may disclose your personal information to respond to legal requirements, 
    enforce our policies, or protect anyone’s rights, property or safety.  If we do 
    disclose your information for one of these reasons, we will do it in accordance with 
    applicable laws and regulations.
</p>

<p>
    We may also share your personal information with:

    </p><ul>
        <li>Third party service providers necessary to provide the service 
            (e.g., data hosting providers), in which case we require that they comply 
            with our Privacy Policy and take appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
        <li>Other third parties whom you explicitly ask us to send your information to</li>
        <li>Law enforcement or other government officials, in response to a verified request 
            relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity.  In such event, 
            we will disclose information that is relevant to the investigation.</li>
    </ul>
<p></p>

</div>

<p>
    We may update this privacy policy from time to time for any reason and will notify you 
    of these changes by posting the new policy on our site.
