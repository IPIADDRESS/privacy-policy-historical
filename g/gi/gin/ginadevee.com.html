<h2>Does GINADEVEE.COM Sell Any Of The Information That It Receives?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simple answer is “no.” Information from and about our customers is a cherished part of our business, and we do not sell any of our customers’ personal information to others. As such, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. However, we may share your information as noted below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Third Parties: In rare cases, GINADEVEE.COM employs other companies or individuals to perform (or help perform) certain functions on our behalf. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, search results, or links, processing credit card information, and/or providing customer service. In doing so, we might share your information with third-party business partners for the purpose of providing our products and/or services to you. However, such third-parties will be given limited access to your information, only as is reasonably necessary to deliver the product or service, and will never receive your information for any other purpose. Furthermore, we will always require any such third-party to adhere to this Privacy Notice, or operate under a similar policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>User Content: Any user content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to our services and/or Website may become available to the public and unable to be removed, except by GINADEVEE.COM in its sole discretion. Once posted on the Website, such user content may not be removable from public view, as copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Website, on other sites that have republished us, or if other users have copied or saved that information. If you do not wish your content to be available to the public, please do not post it on the Website.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Change Of Control: In the unlikely event that we buy or sell/divest/transfer the company, the Website, any of our products, services, assets, or any portion thereof (including any shares in our company), your personal information might be among the content that is sold and/or otherwise transferred in this type of a deal.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Required By Law: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or subpoena, or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our terms of use, or to protect the security, quality or integrity of our Website and related services; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of our company, the Website, our users, customers, and/or others.

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Does GINADEVEE.COM Protect Your Information?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We employ various security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order, or enter, submit, or access your personal information.&nbsp; We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information that you provide. Such information is only accessible to those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are always required to keep such information in confidence. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be kept on file for more than 60 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What About Advertisements And Links To Other Websites?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Occasionally, our Website will include third-party advertising or links to other websites. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies, including differing terms regarding the usage and retention of cookies, and sharing of personal information. As such, we have no control over, responsibility for, or liability because of the activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites. Some third-parties may provide us information about you (such as the sites where you have been shown ads or demographic information) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising. However, we do not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third party sites that display ads or links on our Website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Choices Do You Have About Your Information?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As discussed above, you can always choose to not provide certain information (unless required for the particular transaction), even though it might be needed or beneficial to make a purchase or take advantage of certain features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any time, you may update your account information and e-mail communication by contacting us through the relevant channel. You can stop receiving promotion email communications by following the steps to “unsubscribe” contained in any such email. We make every reasonable effort to promptly process all unsubscribe requests. If you have any questions about opting out of any such emails, please contact us directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although we do not collect or retain any cookies, if you are at all concerned with the usage and retention of such cookies, it is a good idea to disable this function. The “Help” feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its relevant manufacturer.</p>
