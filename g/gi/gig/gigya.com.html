                    our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal
                    information we receive when you visit and use the <a href="http://www.gigya.com">www.gigya.com</a>
                    site (the <b><i>“Site”</i></b>) and when you use our Wildfire services and software
                    via our Site or on the websites of our partners or other third parties (collectively,
                    the <b><i>“Services”</i></b>). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that
                    you provide to us through the Services, (including that which we collect on your
                    behalf) when you access, download, purchase or use any information, services, products
                    or content appearing on the Site or offered by Gigya through the Services</p>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any
                    material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised
                    to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Information Collection: Personally Identifiable Information</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the course of using the Services, we will ask you to provide us with certain
                        personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you
                        and administer your account (<b><i>“Personal Information”</i></b>). Personal Information
                        may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other
                        billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. </li>
                    <li>When you use the Services, our servers automatically record information that your
                        browser sends whenever you visit a website or online service (<b><i>“Log Data”</i></b>).
                        This Log Data may include, but is not limited to, your computer’s Internet Protocol
                        address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to the Site
                        and information you search for on a Site. When a user creates a widget, we may record
                        data related to that activity, the deployment of the widget and any other account
                        related data. </li>
                    <li>Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small
                        data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.
                        We use “persistent cookies” to save your username and login password for future
                        logins to the Site. We use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the
                        Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor
                        web traffic routing on the Site and aggregate usage of the Services. You can instruct
                        your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you
                        before accepting a cookie from the website you visit. If you do not accept cookies,
                        however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality
                        of the Services. </li>
                    <li>You may avoid accepting cookies from Gigya by simply not using the services or by <a class="blueUnderline" href="DisableCookies.aspx">disabling Gigya cookies</a> on your computer.</li>
                    <li>Third party advertisers on the Site or that you interact with through the Services
                        (including any widgets) may also place or read cookies on your computer’s browser,
                        which permit them to collect information about users who view or interact with their
                        advertisements and content. The collection and use of such information is subject
                        to such third party’s privacy policy.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <u>Information Collected on Behalf of Our Users.</u> When you deploy our Services
                    on a website (including deployment of a widget containing your advertising content)
                    and/or provide a widget for a third party to place on their website or social networking
                    site web page, as your agent and on your behalf we may collect certain tracking
                    and usage data generated or provided by End Users (<b><i>“Usage Data”</i></b>).
                    This information includes general widget usage patterns and related campaign success
                    rates. You may also request that we receive or gather personally identifiable information
                    as part of that Usage Data, including but not limited to the email addresses of
                    End Users. Other than as necessary to provide you with the Services, as directed
                    by you or where we have received information independently from the End User (e.g.
                    where an End User registers with us through the Site), Gigya will not review, access,
                    share or disclose Usage Data.</p>
                <p>
                    <b><i>“End User”</i></b> means a visitor to or user of a widget or website that
                    was created with or includes the Services. If you are an End User please note that
                    the information you provide to us may be shared with the Gigya user running our
                    Services. We recommend that you see the privacy policies of such Gigya user or the
                    relevant website for information regarding their privacy practices.

                    <b>Our Policy Toward Children</b></p>
                <p>
                    Gigya does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children

                    us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us
                    at <a href="mailto:privacy@gigya-inc.com" class="blueUnderline">privacy@gigya-inc.com</a>. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided
                    us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.
                </p>

                    credit card payment processing, maintenance, hosting and database management services,

                    and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the
                    law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement
                    officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or
                    appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to
                    subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Gigya or a third party, to protect
                    the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may
                    consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or
                    legally actionable.

                    <b>Emailing Via a Gigya Account</b></p>
                <p>
                    Users that register for the Gigya email service may send emails through use of their
                    accounts. Where registered Gigya users have selected the option of adding one or
                    more email addresses to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding
                    template will be sent from Gigya to those email addresses on their behalf. These
                    email addresses will be stored in the address book the Gigya user creates and will
                    be used only for the purpose of sending the email communication to the addressee.

                    <p>All registered Gigya users may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by
                        logging into their account and changing the “user preferences” associated with their account. If you completely delete all
                        such information, your account may be deactivated. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or
                        for legitimate business purposes. </p>
                    <p><b>Security</b></p>
                    <p>Gigya is concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ a variety of industry-standard measures designed to protect
                        your information from unauthorized access. </p>
                    <p><b>International Transfer</b></p>
                    <p>Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or
                        other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are
                        located outside the United States and choose to provide information to Gigya, please be advised that we transfer Personal
                        Information to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of
                        such information represents your agreement to that transfer. </p>

                        type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact
                        that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or
                        representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security
                        policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies
                        or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites and services follow
                        different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read
                        the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit. </p>
