                        <b>Information Security</b><br>
                        The security of your information is important to us, including but not limited to
                        the PII collected via the Site and Service. We have implemented reasonable security
                        measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once
                        we receive it. This includes, but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption.
                        No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is
                        100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable
                        means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

                        <b>International Transfer – Storage in the United States</b><br>
                        Information collected on this Site or via the Service may be transferred to — and
                        maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other
                        governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those
                        in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to
                        provide information to Gigya, please be advised that we transfer PII to the United
                        States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your
                        submission of such information represents your consent to that transfer.

                        <b>Links to Other Site</b><br>
                        The Site and Service contain links to other websites. If you choose to visit an
                        advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click
                        on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website.
                        The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement
                        is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with
                        that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security
                        policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These
                        other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect
                        data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites and services follow
                        different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you
                        submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the
                        other websites you visit.
