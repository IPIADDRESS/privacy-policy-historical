                        Gigya, Inc. ("<b><i>Gigya</i></b>") is a technology company offering a set of web-delivered
                        tools and services for enabling and optimizing the distribution of social web content.
						The Gigya social platform enables online businesses ("Developers") to
						(a) easily connect their sites to all the major social platforms and integrate with Open ID
						and other external authentication providers; (b) offer their site visitors ("End Users") 
						on-site authentication, sharing and social features to enhance their experience;
                        and (c) analyze a site's social activity with helpful use data and metrics. Gigya's
                        technology also enables Developers and their End Users to easily distribute web
                        content applications such as photos, videos and other widgets ("Web Applications")
                        to social networks and a wide variety of other web destinations, and directly to
                        mobile devices.

                        We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our privacy practices as they pertain
                        to our website, www.gigya.com (the "Site"). We also intend for this policy to inform

                        and services (collectively, the "Service"). This Privacy Policy applies to all aspects

                            Gigya collects personally identifiable information ("PII") via the Site and the
                            Service. PII is any information that may be used to contact, identify or locate
                            an individual, and includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, email
                            address and postal addresses. We generally collect PII under the following scenarios:
                        </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you choose to provide us with your PII via the Site; including, when you send
                            us an email asking a question, we use that information to answer your question and
                            will store it for a reasonable time. </li>
                        <li>Gigya periodically publishes an email newsletter. If you provide Gigya with your
                            email address for the purposes of receiving Gigya's email newsletter, we may also
                            email you with further information and offers from Gigya and/or third parties that
                            we believe you may find useful or interesting. If you decide at any time that you
                            no longer wish to receive such communications, please follow the unsubscribe instructions
                            provided within the email. </li>

                        <li>The Service may enable you to send emails to your friends. If you provide your email
                            address or your friends' email addresses for these purposes, we will store those
                            email addresses, but will not use them to send promotional emails to you or your
                            friends (unless you or your friends independently sign up to receive promotional
                            emails from us.)</li>
						<li>When Developers register to use the Service via the Site, we collect their name, company,
							email address, website URL and telephone number. We also ask them to select a password for
							their account. We use this information to help maintain their account.</li>
                        <li>If you choose to use the Service via one of the many open standards for user authentication
                            and access control (e.g., OpenID, OAuth, Facebook Connect) that enable you to link the Service
                            with accounts you have already established with social networking platforms (e.g., Facebook,
							MySpace) and/or email platforms (e.g., Yahoo! Mail), Gigya will
                            collect the PII as well as other information that you have already provided to the
                            social networking or email platform. This PII may include, but not be limited to, your name,
							email address, postal address, and demographic information such as age, gender and income. 
							In all instances, we obtain, store and use this information in accordance with the policies
							of the social networking or email platform.</li>
                        <li>When Developers use the Service and collect PII, Gigya, will immediately transfer the
							PII back to the Developer and cache such PII for a reasonable time, in order to improve
							the performance of the service. Developers may also elect to have Gigya store the 
							collected PII indefinitely. Please note that information collected by such Web Applications
							is subject to that particular Developer's privacy policy, and that Gigya is merely 
							facilitating the collection, transfer and storage of the PII in accordance with that 
							privacy policy.</li>
						<li>Public Forums. While Gigya takes precautions to ensure the confidentiality of the
                            PII you submit to us via the Site and/or Service, please note that any information
                            posted to publicly facing sections of the Site or Service will be publicly available.
                            For example, if you are using the social community networking features of our Service,
                            the information you post there (e.g., your opinion about your favorite sports team)
                            will be viewable by others. Similarly, if you post comments on the Gigya Forums
                            section of the Site located at <a href="http://forum.gigya.com/forum" target="_blank">
                                http://forum.gigya.com/forum</a>, such information will also be available to
                            the public. Any information you choose to provide in a comment or a submission should
                            reflect how much you want others to know about you. We recommend that you guard
                            your anonymity and we encourage everyone to think carefully about what information
                            about themselves they disclose via this or any other public forum.</li>

                        <li>Emailing via a Gigya Account. End Users may be afforded the opportunity to deploy
                            emails via the Service. Where End Users have selected the option of adding one or
                            more email addresses to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding
                            template will be sent from Gigya to those email addresses on their behalf. These
                            email addresses will be stored in the address book the Gigya End User creates and
                            will be used only for the purpose of sending the email communication to the addressee.
                            We caution all End Users to utilize this email functionality in a responsible manner.</li>

						A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer for record-keeping purposes. 
						We use "persistent cookies" to save your username and login password for future logins
                        to the Site and the Service. We use "session ID cookies" to enable certain features of the Service,

						the Service. We also use web beacons in connection with the Site and Service. Web beacons (also 
						known as "1X1 pixels" or "clear GIFs") are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering

						<u>U.S. - EU and U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Participation for Gigya Inc.</u><br>
						Gigya Inc. ("Gigya") recognizes that the European Union ("EU") has an "ominbus" data 
						protection regime established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC)
						the "Directive") and that Switzerland has adopted a data protection law (together, 
						"Data Privacy Laws").  Among other things, the Data Privacy Laws generally require 
						"adequate protection" for the transfer of personally identifiable information about 
						individuals located in the EU and Switzerland to Gigya's operations in the United States. 
						In connection with providing services to Gigya's customers, Gigya may access personally 
						identifiable information about Gigya's customers' consumers  in the EU and Switzerland 
						("European Consumers") ("European Consumer Data").  Gigya accordingly adheres to the 
						requirements of the US/EU and US/Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the US 
						Department of Commerce ("Safe Harbor") with respect to certain European Consumer Data 
						received in the United States about European Consumers.  Our customers act as the data 
						controller for any European Consumer Data collected in the EU and Switzerland and subsequently 
						transferred to Gigya in the US.  Gigya acts as a data processor on behalf of our customers 
						with respect to such European Consumer Data and accordingly only carries out the instructions 
						of such customers with regard to the collection, processing, and protection of European Consumer 
						Data.  For more information about Safe Harbor please refer to the US Department of Commerce 
						website at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.  European Consumers may first wish to contact the 
						customer with questions regarding European Consumer Data shared with Gigya, as this may be the 
						most efficient means of addressing such access requests.  European Consumers may contact the 
						Gigya Safe Harbor Privacy Contact identified below to review the European Consumer Data that 
						Gigya holds about them.  Any European Consumer who cannot resolve his or her issue directly 
						with the customer or Gigya can contact the local data protection authority for further information
						and assistance.
