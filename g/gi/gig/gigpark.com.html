            </h4>
            GigPark knows you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we'll do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting GigPark, you're accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
            <h4>
              What Personal Information About Users Does GigPark Gather?
            </h4>
            <p>
              The information we learn from users helps us personalize and continually improve your GigPark experience. Here are the types of information we gather.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Information You Give Us: We may receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You provide most such information when you search; make a recommendation; invite a friend; provide account details; participate in a contest or questionnaire; or communicate with customer service. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing your experience, improving our site, and communicating with you.
              </li>
              <li>
                Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Examples of the information we may collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information, such as browser type, version and timezone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number; recommendations and friends you viewed or searched for; and the telephone number used to call our customer service number. We may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain parts of our Website for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
              What About Cookies?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser, to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide certain features.
            </p>
            <p>
              The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Website of its manufacturer. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of GigPark's coolest features, and we recommend you leave them turned on.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Does GigPark Share the Information It Receives?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Except with your consent and as set out below, we will not sell, license, trade or rent your personal information to or with others.
            </p>
            <p>
              GigPark may disclose personal information to third party providers of GigPark, including third parties engaged to assist us in providing services (including but not limited to software development, website development and hosting, data processing, document management and office administration) to you or to carry out one or more of the uses described above.  These service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance and are required to protect personal information disclosed by GigPark and to comply with the general privacy principles describes in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              GigPark reserves the right to disclose personal information to a third party if a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order legally requires or authorizes us to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
              GigPark also reserves the right to disclose and / or transfer personal information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession), lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer, conveyance or financing of all or any portion of GigPark or of any of the business or assets or shares of GigPark or a division thereof in order for you to continue to receive the same products and services from the third party.
            </p>
            <h4>
              How Secure Is Information About Me?
            </h4>
            <p>
              We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you enter.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and your computer. Be sure to sign off when you've finished using a shared computer.
            </p>
            <h4>
              What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Web sites?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Our site may include third-party advertising and links to other Web sites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party Web sites.
            </p>
            <p>
              These third-party Web sites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our Web site directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party Web sites are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"), including information about how to opt-out of their information collection.
            </p>
            <p>
              GigPark may also display targeted advertising based on personal information about users. Although GigPark does not provide any personal information to advertisers, advertisers (including ad-serving companies) may assume that users who interact with or click on a targeted advertisement meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Which Information Can I Access?
            </h4>
            <p>
              If you request access to your personal information, subject to certain exceptions, GigPark will inform you of the existence, use and disclosure of your personal information and will provide you with a summary of that information.  If GigPark determines not to provide you access to your personal information, we will provide an explanation.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can help us maintain the accuracy of your personal information by notifying us of any changes to this information.  You may contact GigPark in any one of the following ways to request access to or correction or update of your personal information:
