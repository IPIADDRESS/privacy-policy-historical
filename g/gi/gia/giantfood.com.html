<b>Effective Date: April 14, 2003<br>
					        Revised May 1, 2004</b>
<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL/HEALTH INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND
					        DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT
					        CAREFULLY.</b>
<br>
					        
<br>
					        Giant Food Inc. and its affiliates have a firm and long-standing commitment to
					        protecting our customers' privacy. This Notice describes the privacy protections
					        in place for our pharmacy-related services. Throughout this Notice, we use the
					        term "Pharmacy" to refer to the health care components of Giant Food Inc.,
					        including Giant Pharmacy and the Super G Pharmacy Department. Whenever you visit
					        or receive services from one of these Pharmacy locations, you can expect the
					        privacy of your health information to be protected as described in this
					        Notice.<br>
					        We are required by law to maintain the privacy of your health information, to
					        provide you this detailed Notice of our legal duties and privacy practices
					        relating to your health information and to abide by the terms of the Notice that
					        currently is in effect.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>I. USES AND DISCLOSURES FOR TREATMENT, PAYMENT AND HEALTH CARE
					        OPERATIONS</b>
<br>
					        
<br>
					        Uses and disclosures of health information for treatment, payment and health care
					        operations are permitted by the federal Privacy Rule and authorized by the
					        signature log you sign at the pharmacies. The following lists various ways in
					        which we may use or disclose your Protected Health Information ("PHI") for these
					        purposes.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>For Treatment.</b> We will use and disclose your PHI in providing you with
					        Pharmacy services and may disclose information to other providers involved in
					        your care. For example, our Pharmacy associates will use your health information
					        to dispense prescription medications to you in accordance with your provider's
					        orders. We may contact your provider to discuss your prescription, possible drug
					        interactions, or other concerns.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>For Payment.</b> We may use and disclose your PHI for our billing and payment
					        purposes, or for the billing and payment needs of another health care provider.
					        We may disclose your health information to your representative, to an insurance
					        or managed care company, Medicare, Medicaid, another third party payer, or
					        another health care entity. For example, we may contact your health plan to
					        confirm your coverage for certain prescription medications or the amount of your
					        co-payment.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>For Health Care Operations.</b> We may use and disclose your PHI as necessary
					        for our health care operations, such as management, personnel evaluation,
					        education and training. For example, we may use and disclose your PHI to review
					        the quality of our services.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>Prescription Reminders.</b> We may use or disclose PHI to remind you that your
					        prescriptions are ready to be picked up at the Pharmacy or that it is time for
					        you to refill your prescription.<br>
					        
<br>
					        Treatment Alternatives and Health-Related Benefits and Services. We may use or
					        disclose your PHI to inform you about treatment alternatives and health-related
					        benefits and services that may be of interest to you. We will not sell lists of
					        pharmacy customers or other PHI to third parties for marketing purposes,
					        however.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>II. SPECIFIC USES AND DISCLOSURES OF YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION</b>
<br>
					        
<br>
					        The following lists various ways in which we may use or disclose your PHI.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>To the Patient or their Personal Representative for their own use.</b> On
					        request, we will disclose your PHI to you or your Personal Representative (a
					        person who is authorized by law to act on your behalf with respect to health care
					        matters).<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>Individuals Involved in Your Care or Payment for Your Care.</b> Unless you
					        object, we may disclose PHI about you to a family member, close personal friend
					        or other person who is involved in your care or payment for your care, or we may
					        disclose PHI to notify a family member about your general condition or location.
					        Unless a family member has legal authority to act on your behalf, we will only
					        disclose information relevant to that family member's involvement in your
					        care.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>As Required By Law.</b> We may use or disclose your PHI when required by law
					        to do so.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>Health Oversight Activities.</b> We may disclose your PHI to a health
					        oversight agency, such as the Board of Pharmacy, for activities authorized or
					        required by law, such as audits, investigations and inspections or for activities
					        involving government oversight of the health care system.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>Business Associates.</b> We may disclose your protected health information to
					        a contractor or service provider (known as a "business associate") that needs the
					        information in order to perform services for the Pharmacy and that agrees to
					        protect the confidentiality of this information.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>III. PERMITTED DISCLOSURES OF YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION.</b>
<br>
					        
<br>
					        In addition to the disclosures described above, we may make the following
					        disclosures, subject to conditions and limits in federal and state law. Note: in
					        some circumstances disclosures listed below may be required by law, and so are
					        also covered in Section II above.<br>
					        
<br>
					        Public Health Activities. We may disclose your PHI to a public health authority
					        charged with, for example, preventing or controlling disease, injury or
					        disability.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>Reporting Victims of Abuse, Neglect or Domestic Violence.</b> If we believe
					        that you have been a victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence, we may use
					        and disclose your PHI to notify a government authority, if authorized by law or
					        if you agree to the report.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>To Avert a Serious Threat to Health or Safety.</b> When necessary to prevent a
					        serious threat to your health or safety or the health or safety of the public or
					        another person, we may use or disclose PHI, limiting disclosures to someone able
					        to help lessen or prevent the threatened harm.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>Judicial and Administrative Proceedings.</b> We may disclose your PHI in
					        response to a court or administrative order. We also may disclose information in
					        response to a subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process; efforts must
					        be made to contact you about the request or to obtain an order or agreement
					        protecting the information.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>Law Enforcement.</b> We may disclose your PHI for certain law enforcement
					        purposes, including, for example, to comply with reporting requirements; to
					        comply with a court order, warrant, or similar legal process; or to answer
					        certain requests for information concerning crimes.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>Research.</b> We may use or disclose your PHI for research purposes if the
					        privacy aspects of the research have been reviewed and approved, if the
					        researcher is collecting information in preparing a research proposal, if the
					        research occurs after your death, or if you authorize the use or
					        disclosure.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>Coroners, Medical Examiners, Funeral Directors, Organ Procurement
					        Organizations.</b> We may release your PHI to a coroner, medical examiner, and
					        funeral director or, if you are an organ donor, to an organization involved in
					        the donation of organs and tissue.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>Disaster Relief.</b> We may disclose limited PHI about you to a disaster
					        relief organization.<br>

					        enforcement official or a correctional institution, we may disclose your PHI to

					        of you and others.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>IV. USES AND DISCLOSURES WITH YOUR AUTHORIZATION</b>
<br>
					        
<br>
					        Except as described in this Notice, we will use and disclose your health
					        information only with your written Authorization. You may revoke an Authorization
					        in writing at any time. If you revoke an Authorization, we will no longer use or
					        disclose your health information for the purposes covered by that Authorization,
					        except where we have already relied on the Authorization.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>V. YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION</b>
<br>
					        
<br>
					        Listed below are your rights regarding your health information. Each of these
					        rights is subject to certain requirements, limitations and exceptions. Exercise
					        of these rights may require submitting a written request to the Pharmacy. At your
					        request, the Pharmacy will supply you with the appropriate form to complete. You
					        have the right to:<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>Request Restrictions.</b> You have the right to request restrictions on our
					        use or disclosure of your health information for treatment, payment, or health
					        care operations. You also have the right to request restrictions on the health
					        information we disclose about you to a family member, friend or other person who
					        is involved in your care or the payment for your care.<br>
					        
<br>
					        We are not required to agree to your requested restriction (except that if you
					        are mentally competent, you may restrict disclosures to family members or
					        friends). If we do agree to accept your requested restriction, we will comply
					        with your request except as needed to provide you emergency treatment or in
					        accordance with federal and state law.<br>
					        
<br>
					        
<b>Access to Personal Health Information.</b> You have the right to inspect and
					        obtain a copy of your clinical or billing records or other written information
					        that may be used to make decisions about your care, subject to some exceptions.
					        Your request must be made in writing. In most cases we may charge a reasonable
					        fee for our costs in copying and mailing your requested information.<br>
					        
<br>
					        We may deny your request to inspect or receive copies in certain circumstances.
					        If you are denied access to health information, in some cases you have a right to
					        request review of the denial. This review would be performed by a licensed health
					        care professional who did not participate in the decision to deny.<br>
					        
<br>
					
					        
<ul>
					          
<li>
<b>Note: requests at the Pharmacy for copies of your prescription records,
					          such as for tax submission purposes, are not treated as formal Requests for
					          Access and are handled directly by the Pharmacy. If you wish to exercise your
					          right to access your PHI, you should ask the pharmacist for a special "HIPAA
					          Request for Access" form.</b>
</li>
					        
</ul>
<b>Request Amendment.</b> You have the right to request amendment of your
					        health information maintained by the Pharmacy for as long as the information is
					        kept by or for the Pharmacy. Your request must be made in writing and must state
					        the reason for the requested amendment.<br>
					        
<br>
					        We may deny your request for amendment if the information (a) was not created by
					        the Pharmacy, unless the originator of the information is no longer available to
					        act on your request; (b) is not part of the health information maintained by or
					        for the Pharmacy; (c) is not part of the information to which you have a right of
					        access; or (d) is already accurate and complete, as determined by the
					        Pharmacy.<br>
					        
<br>
					        If we deny your request for amendment, we will give you a written denial
					        including the reasons for the denial and the right to submit a written statement
					        disagreeing with the denial.<br>
					        
<br>
					
					        
<ul>
					          
<li>
<b>Note: simple requests at the Pharmacy, such as changing your address or
					          insurance information, are not treated as formal Requests for Amendment and are
					          handled directly by the Pharmacy. If you wish to exercise your right to request
					          amendments to your PHI, you should ask the pharmacist for a special "HIPAA
					          Request for Amendment" form.</b>
</li>
					        
</ul>
<b>Request an Accounting of Disclosures.</b> You have the right to request
					        an "accounting" of certain disclosures of your health information. This is a
					        listing of disclosures made by the Pharmacy or by others on our behalf, but does

<br>
					        To request an accounting of disclosures, you should ask the pharmacist for a

					        accounting. The first accounting provided within a 12-month period will be free;
					        for further requests, we may charge you our costs.<br>

<b>Note: simple requests at the Pharmacy, such as calling a patient at an
