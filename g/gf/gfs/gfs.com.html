<div><p><i>Last Modified on April 22, 2013</i></p>
<p>This Policy explains how we collect, use and protect the information  we gather at the GFS.com, siennabakery.com and tradeeastspices.com,  websites (collectively "website") that are owned and operated by Gordon  Food Service, Inc. and its related companies (collectively, "GFS", "we"  or "us").</p>
<p>The website has two sections: a section that is available to the  general public, and a section that is restricted to our customers, which  we refer to as the GFS Experience section of the website. While this  policy applies generally to both parts of the website, please note that  there are sections of this policy that apply only to the GFS Experience  section.</p>
<p><b>Updates to this Policy</b></p>
<p>Our business and the laws that regulate us change from time to time,  and we reserve the right to change this policy. If we do change this  policy, we will post the revised version on the website. If we change  our policy in a way that would permit us to make additional uses of  information that we had previously collected about you, we will provide  you with a meaningful way to opt out of those additional uses.</p>
<p>Your use of the site constitutes your acceptance of the privacy  policy in effect at the time of your visit. It is your responsibility to  review this policy for any changes and you are bound by such changes.  Your use of the site following the  posting of changes to this policy  constitutes your acceptance of this policy as modified.</p>
<p><b>How We Collect Information</b></p>
<p>The public section of the website is primarily an information website  that tells you about our company and our products and services. You do  not need to provide any personal information if you simply want to  browse the public section of our website and learn about what we have to  offer. When we ask for your personal information, it is so that we can  provide a service to you and to communicate with you about our products  and services. For example, if you want to register as a customer of Gordon Food Service,  we will ask for your name, address, telephone number and e-mail  address, and we will provide that information to someone in our customer  relations department who will follow up with you about our products and  services.</p>
<p>When you visit the website, we may record information that your web  browser routinely shares with websites. This information may include  your browser type, browser language, Internet Protocol address, the date  and time of your visit, and other information related to your visit.  This information is collected on an anonymous basis, and we do not try  to connect it with your personal information.</p>
<p>The GFS Experience section of the website is only available to our  registered customers. In order to establish access to the GFS  Experience, Gordon Food Service requires personal information associated with your  account. This will generally include your name, the company that you  work for and your contact information. In order to make purchases,  Gordon Food Service may also need credit card or bank account  information.</p>
<p>When you visit our website, we may give you an opportunity to sign up  to receive a newsletter or other marketing materials, or to have your  information shared with other companies whose goods we carry. We may  also ask for your personal information in connection with certain  customizable tools and features, surveys, or contests that we may  operate from time to time on our website. It will always be your choice  whether to provide your personal information in order to take advantage  of these features. If you elect to receive our newsletter or other  marketing materials, you may subsequently elect to stop receiving those  items by checking on the opt-out link included in every email newsletter  we send or by contacting <a href="mailto:%20info@gfs.com">info@gfs.com</a>.  If you have chosen not to receive emails from us prior to your  participation in a contest, sweepstakes, promotion or survey, you may  still receive information from us in connection with such activity if  you register for or participate in it. You may also choose not to  participate in contests, sweepstakes, promotions or surveys if you do  not wish to receive information about us or share your information with  us and the other companies sponsoring such activities at any time by  contacting us by either email at <a href="mailto:%20info@gfs.com">info@gfs.com</a>, phone (800) 968-4164, or post mail, Mailcode: 14007 P.O. Box 1787 Grand Rapids, MI 49501-1787</p>

<p>Users of our website are notified if their information is being  collected by any outside parties, either by this privacy policy or by  some other means. We do this to ensure that our users can make an  informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services  that require an outside party.</p>

If you choose to use our referral  service to tell a friend about Gordon Food Service, we will ask you for your friend's  email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email  inviting him or her to visit the website. We temporarily store this  information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and  tracking the success of our referral program.</p>

<p><b>What We Do with the Information We Collect</b></p>
<p>We will generally use the information that we collect to (i) provide  requested services; (ii) monitor and analyze visitor activity on our  website; (iii) improve the features and operation of our website; (iv)  develop a knowledge base regarding our website visitors and their  preferences; (v) improve our products and services; and (vi) develop new  products and services. As described in the policy, we may provide  certain aggregate information as a service to others for their marketing  purposes.  Except as otherwise stated in this policy, you may need to  further notify such third parties directly if you would like them to  cease use of that information.</p>
<p>In order for us to operate our website, we may need to share  information with our business partners. For example, we may use  contractors to help provide on-line services to help us collect, analyze  and evaluate our information, or to provide other support services for  the website. Often, the information that we share will be aggregate data  that is anonymous in nature. If we provide any individually  identifiable information to others, unless you have agreed otherwise, it  will be on terms that prohibit our business partners from making any  independent commercial use of the information and from sharing the data  with third parties or otherwise making it publicly available.</p>
<p>When you use the GFS Experience website to order products, we will  use the information that you submit to process your order, receive  payment, ship your transaction, and provide other customer support  services. This may require us to share information with third parties,  such as your financial institution, the company that processes credit  card transactions, or an organization involved in shipping your order.  We may also contact the registered users of the GFS Experience website  about important functionality changes to the website, new Gordon Food Service services  and special offers.</p>

<p>We may elect to disclose personal information without prior notice in  response to law enforcement activity or other governmental request; to  respond to subpoenas, court orders or administrative agency requests for  information; to enforce our contract or property rights; to protect  ourselves or others; or when required or otherwise permitted by law. For  example, we may share information to reduce the risk of fraud or if  someone uses or attempts to use our site for illegal reasons.  Information we collect may also be transferred in connection with any  sale or merger of the company or any division or business line of the  company to which the information relates.</p>
<p><b>How We Protect Your Data</b></p>
<p>We use commercially reasonable means to protect the integrity of our  website and the confidentiality of collected data.  However, since no  security system is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of our  databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be  intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. The GFS  Experience section of our site uses a secure server, and the 128-bit  secure socket layer (SSL) in the server software encrypts all  information you input before it is sent to us. We also limit access to  personal information that we collect about our visitors and customers to  employees and others who have a need to use the information consistent  with this policy. Employees who violate these policies may be subject to  discipline.</p>
<p>Protecting your information also requires you to do your part. If you  are a registered user of the GFS Experience, you must take steps to  protect your access code and password.  You are solely responsible for  maintaining and protecting the confidentiality of your user access code  and password and are fully responsible for all activities that occur  under your user ID and password. You can access and update your login  information through your account..</p>
<p><b>Data Integrity and Retention</b></p>
<p>We use the information that we collect about you only in ways that  are consistent with this policy. If you provide us with contact  information on the public section of our site, we normally keep this  information for only a short time period, at which point it will be  automatically deleted from our system. Information collected in  connection with the GFS Experience section of our website will be  retained for a longer period as a record of our business activities.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or complaints about our practices, would  like to request having your information removed from our database, or  would like to opt out of receiving any future communications, please let  us know at <a href="mailto:info@gfs.com">info@gfs.com</a>.</p>
