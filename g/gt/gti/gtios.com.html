<section class="ad-specs">

<p class="intro">This privacy notice tells you about the information we collect from you when you engage with one of our websites or services. In collecting this information, we are acting as a data controller and, by law, we are required to provide you with information about us, about why and how we use your data, and about the rights you have over your data.</p>


<h2>Changes to data protection law</h2>
<p>From the 25th of May 2018, we will be processing your personal data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). Up until that point we will continue to process your personal data in accordance with the existing Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA). This notice is written to comply with both the DPA and the GDPR.</p>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>We are GTI Media, a company which is part of our parent company Group GTI. Our main address is:</p>

<h2>What personal data do we collect?</h2>
<p>We request certain personal information from you in order for us to assist you in providing information relating to career options, job opportunities, undergraduate and postgraduate study options and other related services such as employer-sponsored events and competitions aimed at post-sixteen, graduate and postgraduate job seekers. This may include CVs and personal contact details.</p>

In both cases this may include racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation and health (ie. whether you are registered disabled). You can decide whether you wish to share this information with us. Not sharing this information does not prevent you from registering or using our services.</p>
<p>We also on occasion may request information related to social mobility which may be required by an employee for an event, course provider or employer opportunity.</p>
<p>Through the use of cookies and other similar technology we may record your interaction with our websites and systems to help improve the delivery of our services. In addition as part of our security measures we may also record the IP address from which you are engaging with us.</p>

<h2>Where else may we get data from?</h2>
<h3>Associated partners</h3>
<p>For our GTI media websites, for example targetjobs.co.uk, targetcareers.co.uk and gradireland.com, we sometimes obtain personal data from third parties. In such circumstances we are reliant on the third party supplier’s assurances that they have the appropriate legal basis for processing and transferring this data. We record the source of this data so you can ask us at any time from where we got your personal details and object to the processing should you believe your data was inappropriately transferred. </p>
<h3>Inspiring Futures</h3>

As such, in relation to personal data collected via Futurewise and other related services provided by Inspiring Futures Limited, both GTI Media and Inspiring Futures are joint data controllers with respect to personal data collected from their profiling service and career related events.</p>

<h2>Why do we collect this information?</h2>
<p>We collect information about you in order to provide you with the best careers advice possible tailored to your specific preferences or experience. The information is also necessary for us and employers to match you against any opportunities that they have.</p>
<p>For employer sponsored events and awards we may use the information collected to contact you in relation to those opportunities that fit your profile.</p>
<p>In addition, we sometimes use the anonymous personal data (ie. with all personal identifiers removed) for the purposes of research, industry trend reporting and for our own planning purposes and future developments.</p>

<h2>Where is my information stored?</h2>
<p>Your information is either stored in the databases for our websites or other systems, all of which are based within the European Union (specifically the UK).</p>

<h2>What do we do with your information?</h2>
<p>The personal information you provide helps us to offer more tailored advice and opportunities depending on your preferences. Our aim is to provide you with only content relevant to you. This includes any careers advice, job opportunities, information about our employer-sponsored events, and our awards events that may be sent to you via email or other means (where you have provided the appropriate information). You may unsubscribe to these emails or change your profile information at any time either via the site or through the link provided at the bottom of each email.</p>

<ul>

<li>To facilitate any social media sharing functionality and authentication.</li>
<li>To resolve complaints and data access requests in accordance with data protection law.</li>
<li>For the facilitation of any legal obligations or defend any court actions that we may have.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who we might share your data with?</h2>
<h3>Our group of companies</h3>
<p>In order to deliver the best possible integrated careers advice and services to you, from time to time we may transfer your personal details between our websites. This may on occasion be across different companies within our group. Before doing so we conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment in order to ensure that any such transfers do not impact your rights. You may object to your data being processed in this manner by contacting us using the details above.</p>

<h3>Our service providers</h3>
<p>For the purposes of sending emails and maintaining engagement information we will maintain a secure copy of your personal data with our service partners whom provide the facilities to email users based on their preference criteria and track engagement. Access to this data is strictly controlled and we remain the data controller.</p>

<h3>Employers and sponsors</h3>
<p>In addition, the CVs you submit directly to us will be accessible by our Search team (who recruit on behalf of employers) working for our sister company GTI Recruiting Solutions (also known as TARGETrecruit) as well as potential employers.</p>
<p>Along with your CV, personal details contained in your profile might be shared with potential employers where you have expressed an interest in joining or attending one of their careers events or entering their sponsored competition run on their behalf by GTI.</p>
<p>Your profile details (with the exception of any special categories of personal data as defined by Article 9 of the GDPR) including contact information will also be supplied to employers if you have agreed to be contacted directly by the employer or course provider for a particular role, course or event via our direct message functionality. Employers or course providers should only contact you with respect of that particular role or event in each instance, and you have the right to request that the Employer stop contacting you by getting in touch with them directly.</p>
<p>For TARGETjobs events that you have attended we may also share your personal details including your CV with employers at the event so that they may contact you directly about opportunities with them.</p>

<h3>Government, legal or regulatory authorities</h3>
<p>GTI may be required to share your personal information with certain public or legal authorities where there is a legislative obligation to do so.</p>

<h2>Automated processing and profiling</h2>
<p>We use the information you provide to make automated decisions solely in the capacity of delivering you content based on your stated preferences. Personal data may be matched against potential vacancies in order to provide relevance to the content and information we provide you. However you have at all times access to all available vacancies and may change your preferences to amend what content or vacancies are filtered.</p>
<p>There are no automated decision making processes that would impact you as a result of any automated processing. No judgements or decisions are made of an individual’s suitability for a particular role as a result of any processing that may take place.</p>
