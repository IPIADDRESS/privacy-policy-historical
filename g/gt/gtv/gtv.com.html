<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>GTV recognizes that the users of GTV.com value their privacy and we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy (as defined below) explains our privacy practices, including what types of information we collect from you and how we may use it, our rights to share and disclose such information to third parties and how you can review and modify information that you provide to us and your preferences regarding our use or disclosure of such information.</p>
<p>This is the privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") for www.GTV.com (the "Site"). The Site is provided by GTV Corporation and its affiliates ("GTV", "we" or "us"). Please review our Terms of Use Agreement which governs your use of the Site. Any capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given in the Terms of Use Agreement.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your use of or participation in the Site or any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity offered through the Site terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the Site or any features, activities or services offered through the Site.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies regardless of the Device you use to access the Site and whether you are accessing the Site as a registered user or otherwise. This Privacy Policy governs only the Information collected by us on the Site and does not cover any other information collected in any other manner or collected by any other entity, unless specifically stated. We may combine your Information with other information we collect from other sources, such as information received from our affiliated companies, marketing companies or Advertisers and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You may choose to provide certain information to us when you use the Site. When we use the term "Personal Information" we mean any information that we collect on the Site that would allow someone to identify you or contact you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address or telephone number. When we use the term "Additional Information", we mean any information that we collect on the Site other than Personal Information, like your musical preferences, etc. (Personal Information and Additional Information will be collectively referred to as "Information"). By visiting, accessing or otherwise using the Site, you affirmatively consent to our collection and use of Information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>INFORMATION WE COLLECT </li>

<ul>
<li>A. User Registration. If you elect to become a registered user of the Site, we will require you to provide a username and password (together, your "User ID"), along with certain Personal Information including your email address and date of birth. In addition, you may be given the option (but are not required) to provide Additional Information, such as your gender, country and mobile phone number. </li>
<li>B. Site Features, Functions and Communications. The Site may provide you with access to certain features or functions, such as interactive and community features, message boards, ratings and profile pages. To participate in these features and functions, you may be asked to provide certain Information about you in order to personalize and/or allow you to use these features and functions. For example, in order to personalize your user profile on the Site, you will have the option to provide a profile image, your city, state and country and a short description of yourself. At times, you may be presented with the opportunity to sign up to receive newsletters, email communications, or other communications from us in order for us to provide up-to-date information about the Site, and to publicize and promote certain content, products and services offered by us or our business partners. When there is a separate sign-up for newsletters, we may ask for your contact information such as name and email address, and, sometimes, demographic and profile information. </li>
<li>C. Contests, Sweepstakes and Surveys. To participate in certain Site-related contests, sweepstakes and surveys, there may be a separate registration process which may require the submission of both Personal Information and Additional Information (including your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, demographic or profile information, etc.). We will use the Information you provide for the purpose of conducting the promotion (for example, to contact you if you have won). You may also have the opportunity to opt-in to receive special Promotions or offers from our Advertisers as a result of your use of the Site.</li>
<li>D. Information Collected Through Automatic Data Collection. Our Site includes features that automatically collect Additional Information regarding your visits to the Site to assist us in keeping track of your preferences, create a more tailored user experience and better serve your particular interests and needs.</li></ul>
<p>The Site and/or third parties may use "cookies," (which are small data files containing information about you that is stored on your hard drive), "embedded scripts", and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, "Tracking Technologies") to collect Additional Information automatically as you interact with the Site. Some cookies are used to make login to our Site easier (such as by remembering your User ID). Cookies also enable us to track your interaction with the Site and target your interests to enhance your Site experience (e.g., for tracking your sessions and use of the playbar, what videos you have in your playbar, etc.). We may also use Tracking Technologies to collect "clickstream" data, such as the domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on our Site, pages viewed, content searched for, access times and other relevant statistics, and assign unique identifiers to the Device you use to access the Site for the same purposes. Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process. However, we may associate the information obtained through these Tracking Technologies with your Personal Information so we can better customize your Site experience and provide tailored advertisements and Promotions related to your specific interests. By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site as described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>This Site may also use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, "Third Party Advertising Service Providers") to, for example, serve advertisements on the Site, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site. Such services may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Site and other websites you have visited. Targeting services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.</p>

<li>SECURITY 
While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information. However, regardless of our efforts and the Device you use to access the Site, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We also limit access to the Site by our own employees, contractors, Site service providers and those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information. We request that our third party contractors and Site service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality. </li>

If you are a resident of the State of California, we provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options such as your right to opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as "unsubscribe") or opt-in for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as Advertisers) for marketing purposes. Therefore, pursuant to the California Civil Code, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. If you are a California resident and wish to request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request by email to our Privacy Administrator at legal@GTV.com or by postal mail to GTV Corporation, c/o Privacy Administrator, 318 S.
