					    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

						<p>This privacy policy explains how GLG Research® ("GLG Research," "we" and "us") collects, uses, shares and protects information obtained from Council MembersSM and from visitors to its websites (each, a "Site" and collectively, the "Sites").</p>
						<p>If you are a Council Member, you have agreed and are additionally subject to the <a href="tandc.aspx">Terms and Conditions of Council Membership</a> in the Gerson Lehrman Group Councils ("Terms and Conditions"), which expressly incorporates this Privacy Policy. If you are not a Council Member, by visiting the Sites you consent to the collection and use of your information under the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
						<h5>Personal Information and Other Data We Collect</h5>
						<p>GLG Research collects information that you voluntarily provide to us, including your name, contact details, and professional biography. GLG collects additional information from Council Members about, for example, their participation in the GLG Councils<sup>SM</sup> and interactions with our clients. GLG may also collect information about Council Members from our clients and third parties.</p>
						<p>When you visit our Sites, we send one or more cookies a small file containing a string of characters to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Cookies make it easier for you to log on to and use the Sites during future visits. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)</p>
						<p>GLG Research's servers automatically record information when you visit our Sites. These servers' logs include information such as your web request and Internet Protocol address.</p>
						<p>Collectively, the information that GLG Research collects about you, including personal information, is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "your information."</p>
						<h5>Use Of Your Information</h5>
						<p>We use your information to process and administer details of your Council Membership, to provide you with opportunities to participate in the GLG Research Councils, and to keep you up to date with new developments at GLG Research. We also use and analyze the information we collect so that we can administer, support, improve and develop our business.</p>
						<p>We do not sell or share your personal information obtained through our Sites with third parties for their marketing purposes. GLG and trusted third parties process personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected.</p>
						<p>GLG Research may contact you using personal information you voluntarily provide. In particular, we may contact Council Members about specific projects or consulting opportunities.</p>
						<p>If you begin but do not complete the application process, GLG Research may contact you based on information you provide us to determine if you wish to complete the process of becoming a Council Member.</p>
						<h5>Disclosure Of Your Information</h5>
						<p>Your information will be held by GLG Research in the United States and may also be held and accessed by GLG Research staff and third parties working for GLG Research, or GLG Research's subsidiaries and affiliates, inside and outside the United States. If your information is gathered outside the United States, it may be transferred to GLG Research's United States offices to be used for these purposes, and it may be transferred to and shared with any of GLG Research's worldwide locations. You may request a full list of all subsidiaries and affiliates of Gerson Lehrman Group, Inc.</p>
						<p>GLG Research may disclose your information in response to legal process, to protect our rights, as otherwise required by law, or for the prevention or detection of a crime. If we sell our company or part of it, or our business enters into a joint venture with another business entity, GLG Research may disclose your information to our new business partners or owners who may then provide you with information about their products and services.</p>
						<p>Additional provisions applicable only to Council Members:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>GLG Research may disclose your information to Clients.</li>
						<li>GLG Research may disclose your information to third parties, such as current and former employers and companies that you have provided services to or contracted with, for the purpose of confirming any consents or approvals that you may need to participate in the GLG Research Councils or in specific Project(s).</li>
						<li>GLG Research's Clients, if required by law or the Clients compliance policies, may disclose information about their projects with you, for example your name and the amount you were paid on the project ("Required Client Disclosures"). For example, a pharmaceutical company may be required to publicly disclose certain of its interactions with healthcare professionals.</li>
						<li>GLG Research reserves the right to conduct background checks on you, including through a third-party service. GLG may seek to verify your employment history and check for any criminal history. GLG Research may seek to verify the duration and accurate invoicing and description of Projects you conduct for Clients.</li>
						<li>GLG Reseach may share your information with non-Client third parties for the purpose of promoting GLG Research's business, including without limitation by displaying such information on GLG Research's websites, print media and other materials (collectively, "Marketing Materials"), subject to your right to opt-out, as provided in the Terms and Conditions of Council Membership.</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Accessing &amp; Updating Your Information</h5>
						<p>You are entitled to see the personal information held about you, subject to GLG Research's confidentiality obligations to its clients. You may also request that we make changes to your personal information so that it is accurate and kept up to date, and we may update your information using data obtained from third parties. Council Members are required regularly to update the biographical and employment information that they provide to GLG Research.</p>
						<h5>Your Ability To Opt-Out Of Information Collection &amp; Use</h5>
						<p>You may choose not to provide personal information to GLG Research.</p>
						<p>Council Members may opt-out of membership in the GLG Research Councils, whereupon we will use reasonable efforts to cease contacting such persons.</p>
						<p>You may set up your computer to reject cookies. However, in that case, you may not be able to use certain features on our Sites.</p>
						<h5>Content Forwarding</h5>
						<p>GLG Research may provide tools on the Sites to forward content from the Sites to others through e-mail or other means. E-mail address(es) that you supply for content forwarding will be used for that purpose only.</p>
						<h5>Refer A Colleague</h5>
						<p>You may use the "Refer a Colleague" feature to send an e-mail to a colleague who has consented to being contacted by us. Your name will appear as the sender on the referral e-mail. The referral e-mail offers recipients the ability to opt-out of receiving further referral e-mails. GLG Research may store referral information in order to present other opportunities to your colleagues. Only provide a telephone number if your colleague has consented to being contacted by GLG Research by phone.</p>
						<h5>Security &amp; Information Retention</h5>
						<p>We employ security measures to protect your information both online and offline from access by unauthorized persons and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. We will retain your information for a reasonable period or as long as the law requires. If you are a Council Member, GLG Research may retain your information for its business purposes if you cease to be a member of the GLG Research Councils, provided that GLG Research will protect all such information about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
						<h5>Links</h5>
						<p>Our Sites may contain links to other web sites belonging to third parties. Please make sure when you leave our Sites that you have read that web site's privacy policy as this Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected at our Sites.</p>
						<h5>Changes To This Policy</h5>
						<p>GLG Research may update this policy. Any changes to this Privacy Policy in the future will be posted to the Sites. Your continued use of these Sites and, if you are a Council Member, your continued participation in the GLG Research Councils, will indicate your agreement to such changes.</p>
