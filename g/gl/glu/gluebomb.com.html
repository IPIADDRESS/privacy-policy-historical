                <h3>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h3>

                <p>

                    This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal

                    Information"), and other information described in this policy, gathered when you are using

                    or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal

                    Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business

                    partners.

                    This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or

                    control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications,

                    such as Facebook ("Third Party Services") that you elect to access through the Service

                    or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access

                    only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take

                    responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of those Third Party Services.

                    We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you

                    access.

                </p>

                <h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>

                <p>The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate

                    the Services. In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect,

                    use, share, and/or display some of your Personal Information. We collect the following types

                    of information from our users.</p>

                <h3>Account Information:</h3>

                <p>

                    When you create an Account, you will provide information, such as your username,

                    password and email address. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to

                    you, and by creating an Account on the Services and providing Personal Information to us,

                    you allow others, including us, to identify you. If you access the Services through Facebook

                    credentials, we may automatically collect certain information, such as your name, picture,

                    and email address. We will use all information available through Facebook in accordance

                    with Facebook's policies and your preferences selected through Facebook. We may use

                    your contact information to send you information about our Services, when we feel such

                    information is important. You may unsubscribe from these messages through your Account

                    settings, although we reserve the right to contact you even if you unsubscribe when we

                    believe it is necessary, such as for Account recovery purposes.

                </p>

                <h3>User Content:</h3>

                <p>

                    Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services, such as written

                    comments. All content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely,

                    even after you terminate your account. We may continue to disclose such content to third

                    parties, as described in this Privacy Policy.

                </p>

                <h3>IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:</h3>

                <p>

                    We automatically receive and record information from your device or web browser when you

                    interact with the Services, including your IP address and cookie information. This information

                    is used for fighting spam/malware and also to facilitate collection of data concerning your

                    interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on).

                    Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and

                    frequency of visitors to the Site or mobile application. We may use this data in aggregate

                    form, that is, as a statistical measure. This type of aggregate data enables us and third

                    parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that

                    we can analyze and improve them.

                    When you visit the Site, we may also collect information about your online activities over time

                    and across third-party websites or online services. Because there is not yet a consensus

                    on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other do-not-track ("DNT")

                    mechanisms, we do not respond to web browser-based DNT signals at this time.

                </p>

                <h3>Location Data:</h3>

                <p>

                    Some of our Services, such as mobile applications, may collect geo-location data to provide

                    location-related functionality. We may link location data to other information we have

                    collected about you. You may stop sharing your location data by adjusting your mobile

                    device’s location services settings. For instruction on changing the relevant settings, please

                    contact your service provider or device manufacturer.

                </p>

                <h3>Email Communications:</h3>

                <p>

                    We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to

                    improve our Services, including customer service.

                </p>

                <h3>Information Collected Using Cookies:</h3>

                <p>

                    Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser

                    when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each

                    website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and

                    tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Services through the Internet.

                    We may use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services

                    and may associate that information with your Account if you have one.

                    Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your

                    browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your

                    browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of

                    ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to

                    take advantage the most attractive features of the Services.

                    This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by

                    third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer.

                    For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.

                </p>

                <h3>Information Related to Advertising and the Use of Web Beacons:</h3>

                <p>

                    To support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and also allow

                    third parties advertisements, through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes

                    targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called "ad

                    networks." Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors

                    and research firms. We may engage with ad networks that are members or organizations or

                    programs that manage the advertising privacy choices these ad networks offer consumers.

                    When you visit our Site or use our mobile applications or other Services, ad networks and

                    other parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across

                    different websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these ad networks and

                    other parties.

                    Advertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain

                    general profile category may be inferred from information provided to us by a user, may be

                    based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity

                    on Third Party Services. We do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use

                    other than in connection with the Services.

                    To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known as a "web

                    beacon") from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks

                    to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for

                    advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements

                    to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these

                    advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can view,

                    edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

                </p>

                <h3>Aggregate Information:</h3>

                <p>We collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users,

                    collectively, use the Services ("Aggregate Information"). Some of this information is derived

                    from Personal Information.</p>

                <h3>How, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared?</h3>

                <p>

                    The Services are designed to help you share information with others. As a result, some of

                    the information generated through the Services is shared publicly or with third parties.

                    Public Information about Your Activity on the Services:

                    Some of your activity on and through the Services is public by default. This may include,

                    but is not limited to, content you have posted publicly on the Site or otherwise through the

                    Services, such as written posts, comments, or other submissions by you to the Site.

                    Registered users may have some of this information associated with their Accounts.

                    Unregistered users will not have this association, but information concerning their use of the

                    Services (such as what pages they have visited) may be tracked through the use of cookies

                    and stored by us.

                    Please also remember that by choosing to provide Personal Information using certain public

                    features of the Services, you make your information publicly available. User reading such

                    information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and

                    without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore

                    urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in

                    content that you create or information that you submit through the Services.

                    IP Address Information:

                    While we collect and store IP address information, that information is not made public. We

                    do at times, however, share this information with our partners, service providers and other

                    entities with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.

                    Information You Elect to Share:

                    You may access other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking

                    on links to those Third Party Services from within the Site. We are not responsible for the

                    privacy policies and practices of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible for

                    reading and understanding those Third Party Services' privacy policies. This Privacy Policy

                    only governs information we collect in connection with the Services.

                    Aggregate Information:

                    We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons

                    with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners

                    can understand how and how often people use our Services and their services or websites,

                    which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them.

                    In addition, these third parties may share with us information about you that they have

                    independently developed or acquired.</p>

                    <h3>Email Communications with Us:</h3>

                    <p>As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications

                    from us, such as communications relating to your Account. Communications relating to your

                    Account will be sent for purposes important to the Services, such as password recovery.

                    We may use your email address to contact you for editorial purposes, to advise you of any

                    changes to our Site, and to send you messages about our marketing partners' products. You

                    may choose not to receive our marketing emails by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the

                    emails you receive from us. Please note that even if you opt out, we may continue sending

                    you service-related information.

                    User Profile Information:

                    User profile information including your username and other information you enter may be

                    displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services. We will not reveal

                    user email addresses to other users of the Site.

                    Information Shared with Our Service Providers:

                    We employ and contract with service providers - individuals and entities that perform certain

                    tasks on our behalf. We may need to share Personal Information with our service providers

                    in order to provide products or services to you. We do not authorize our service providers to

                    use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary

                    to assist us.

                    Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:

                    In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user

                    information, including Personal Information, is typically one of the transferred business

                    assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of

                    business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred

                    or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur. Following the
