                  You can visit glyde.com without telling us
                  who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you
                  register, you are no longer unidentified to us. If you choose to provide us
                  with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that
                  information on our servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Glyde Corporation (Glyde) will collect

                    <p>
                      Billing and shipping address, email address, and financial information,

                      your activities on the sites (buying and selling)

                  <li>

                      Billing, shipping, and other
                      information you provide to purchase or sell an item

                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  You also provide information when you
                  search, buy, sell, fill out a questionnaire, communicate with customer
                  service, contact us by phone, e-mail, physical mail, or participate in
                  community features. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with
                  such information as your name, address, phone numbers; credit card
                  information; and people (and their addresses) to whom purchases have been
                  shipped.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Examples of the information we collect and
                  analyze include, but are not limited to, the Internet protocol (IP) address
                  used to connect your computer to the Internet; e-mail address;
                  password; computer and connection information such as browser type, version,
                  time-zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system,
                  platform; purchase history; products you viewed or searched for; and your
                  sales history. We may also use browser data such as cookies, or similar data
                  on certain parts of our Website for fraud prevention and other purposes.
                  During some visits we may use software tools to measure and collect session
                  information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits
                  to certain pages, navigation patterns, page interaction information (such as
                  scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the
                  page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Glyde may also collect information from
                  third parties. Examples of information we receive from other sources include
                  updated delivery and address information from our carriers or other third
                  parties, which we use to correct our records and deliver your next purchase or
                  communication more easily; purchase or redemption information, and page-view
                  information from other sites with which we operate co-branded businesses or
                  for which we provide technical, fulfillment, advertising, or other services;
                  search term and search result information, search results and links, including
                  paid listings (such as Sponsored Links); and credit history information from
                  credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect fraud and to offer
                  certain credit or financial services to some customers.
                </p>
                <h2>Marketing</h2>
                <p>
                  Glyde will not sell or rent
                  your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes
                  without your explicit consent. We may merge your information with information
                  we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize our
                  content and services. If you don't wish to receive marketing communications
                  from us, you have the option to "opt out" by clicking on the link at the
                  bottom of an email.
                </p>
                <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
                <p>
                  Glyde may disclose personal information to
                  enforce our policies, respond to legal requirements, or protect anyone's
                  property, rights, or safety.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We may also share your personal information with:

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Law enforcement or other governmental
                      officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal
                      investigation or alleged illegal activity. In such events, we will
                      disclose information relevant to the investigation, such as name, city,
                      state, zip code, telephone number, email address, User ID history, IP
                      address, fraud complaints, and bidding and listing history.

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Service providers under contract who
                      help with our business operations (such as fraud investigations, bill
                      collection, affiliate and rewards programs, merchant services, and
                      fulfillment services).
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Other business entities, should we
                      plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity. (In the
                      event such a combination occurs, we will require that the new combined
                      entity adhere to this privacy policy with respect to your personal
                      information. You will receive prior notice, if your personal
                      information will be used contrary to this policy.)
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Without limiting the above, in an effort to maintain your privacy, we will not
                  disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government
                  officials, or other agencies without a subpoena, court order or substantially
                  similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the
                  disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or
                  financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.
                </p>
                <h2>Personal and Financial Information</h2>
                <p>
                  Your User Name is not displayed to other users during a transaction on
                  glyde.com. The only time anyone will know your name and shipping address is
                  when you are involved in a transaction, and a seller receives a pre-addressed
                  Glyde Mailer to send you an item. The seller will have no access to any
                  information other than your name and shipping address. Our User Agreement and
                  this Privacy Policy prohibits sellers from contacting buyers beyond
                  fulfillment of a given transaction. If you receive unwanted contact from a
                  seller, please email us at
                  <a href="mailto:service@glyde.com">service@glyde.com</a>.
                  Users who are not directly involved in shipping an item to you cannot view
                  your shipping address.

                <h2>Cookies</h2>

                  Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons,
                  such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the
                  Website of its manufacturer. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage
                  of some of glyde.com's best features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.

                  Your password is important because it
                  serves as a key to access your account. Do not disclose your password to
                  anyone. When selecting your password, use unique letters (upper and lower
                  case), numbers, and characters. If you share your password or your personal
                  information with others, you are responsible for all actions taken in the name
                  of your account, and may jeopardize the security of your personal information.
                  If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately
                  contact us at
                  <a href="mailto:service@glyde.com">service@glyde.com</a>
                  and go to the website and change your password.
