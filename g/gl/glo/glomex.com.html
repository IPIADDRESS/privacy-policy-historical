<p>For glomex GmbH, Medienallee 4, 85774 UnterfÃ¶hring, your trust in the correct handling of your data is an important prerequisite for the success of the offer of glomex GmbH. The collection, processing (including storage, modification, transfer, locking and deletion) and use of your data will always be in compliance with the applicable data protection law provisions.</p>
<p><strong>1. Collection, processing and use of personal data</strong></p>
<strong>a) What is personal data?</strong>
<p>Personal data means information regarding the identity of a person, such as name, address, telephone and fax number, date of birth or email address.</p>
<strong>b) Is personal data collected, processed and used in connection with the usage of the online offer?</strong>
<p>In principle, the offer can be used without the storage of personal data. If personal data is collected, processed and used nevertheless, glomex GmbH will inform you at the respective time or ask you to enter your personal data yourself â for example for the participation in a contest or for the registration for a service. In such a case, your personal data will only be collected, processed and used for this specific purpose and in compliance with the principle of data economy.</p>
<p>In the following, you will find some examples of where we collect, process and use personal data:&nbsp;</p>
â¢ Personalized services
<p>If you use services which require a registration, we will collect, process and use the data required for these services in particular for providing these services to you.</p>
<p>Upon the express registration by the User, the following data may be collected (as long as it is entered by the User himself): Gender, first name, last name, date of birth, email address, street, house number, zip code, phone number, account number, banking code and account holder. glomex GmbH will collect, process and use the personal data you enter during the registration only for the purpose of concluding, performing and handling the respective contract as well as for invoicing purposes. A collection, processing or use of personal data beyond the above purposes shall only be admitted if the Client has given his express consent or if a statutory provision allows or dictates the collection, processing or use of personal data for other purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any personal data you provide will be collected, processed and used solely by glomex GmbH, as the responsible organization. glomex GmbH will not pass on your personal data to any third party, in particular not to companies or other organizations, unless you provide your express consent to glomex GmbH or glomex GmbH is legally required to disclose such data, for example due to the order of a court or an official order. If, in the context of commissioned data processing in accordance with sec. 11 of the German Federal Data Protection Act, glomex GmbH commissions third parties with the collection, processing and use of data, this will also only occur in compliance with the statutory data protection provisions.</p>
<p><strong>2. Collection, processing and use of usage data<br>a) What is usage data?</strong></p>
<p>Usage data means data that can be collected upon the opening of each webpage.</p>
<strong>b) How is usage data collected, processed and used in connection with the usage of this offer?</strong>
<p>When you visit the offer, glomex GmbH stores your usage data for a short period of time of four (4) business days. The following data is stored: the domain name or IP address of the requesting computer, the data request of the Client (file name and URL), the http response code, the website from which you visit us as well as the date and the duration of your visit. The storage is performed in order to detect errors in or the misuse of our online offer and of our telecommunication services/equipment, if the latter are required for the creation of further connections and/or for invoicing purposes. Your usage data will not be analyzed for the creation of a personal usage profile unless you have expressly consented to such a use. In the case of errors or misuse, we reserve the right to file charges with the law enforcement authorities. There will be no other usage or disclosure to third parties of your usage data collected as described above.</p>
If you expressly register, a collection, processing or use of your usage data for invoicing purposes might be necessary. In this case, your usage data will be stored for a period of no longer than six months after the issuance of the invoice; it will only be stored longer if and for as long as the User raises objections against the invoice or fails to pay the invoice despite a payment request.
<p>If the data is required for compliance with storage periods dictated by law, by the articles of association or contracts (including contracts with third parties), we will lock the data in accordance with statutory provisions. Any usage data will be collected, processed and used solely by glomex GmbH, as the responsible organization. glomex GmbH will not pass on your personal data to any third party, in particular not to companies or other organizations, unless you provide your express consent to glomex GmbH or glomex GmbH is legally required to disclose such data, for example due to the order of a court or an official order. If, in the context of commissioned data processing in accordance with sec. 11 of the German Federal Data Protection Act, glomex GmbH commissions third parties with the collection, processing and use of data, this will also only occur in compliance with the statutory data protection provisions.</p>
<p><strong>3. Correction of data and revocation</strong></p>

<p>b) You can also contact the above mentioned address if you would like to revoke your consent to the collection, processing and use of your data in the future. In this case, glomex GmbH will immediately delete any of your data stored in this regard, if, taking into consideration the contractual purpose, such deletion is possible and if no mandatory statutory reasons prevent a deletion. Please note that due to technical and organizational reasons, an overlap between your revocation and the use of your data in the context of an ongoing campaign may occur.</p>
<p><strong>4. Use of cookies<br></strong>We would like to point out that this service uses cookies. It is not a prerequisite for the usage of the service that the Visitor/User accepts the cookies. However, some functions might not be available if cookies are blocked.</p>
<p>a) What are cookies?</p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file, which is sent by the respective servers when the service is visited and cached on the hard drive of the respective User. If the respective server is once again contacted, the Userâs browser will sent the previously received cookies back to the server. The server can analyze the information received through this procedure in different ways. There are generally two types of cookies. First, there are session cookies which are only stored for a respective visitor session. This means that the cookies will be automatically deleted once the Visitor/User closes the respective service. Second, there are temporary/permanent cookies which are stored on the Userâs data carrier for a longer period of time or indefinitely.</p>
<p>b) How does glomex GmbH use cookies?</p>
<p>glomex GmbH uses session cookies as well as temporary/permanent cookies for its services. When a User visits a service, the cookies are sent to the Userâs browser and stored on the Userâs hard drive. These cookies help to make our offer more user-friendly, more effective and safer. The cookies do not contain any personal data or personal information on the User so that it is not possible to identify a person based on the information obtained by means of the cookies. The obtained information serves exclusively for the purpose of creating statistics on the usage of our offer. Thus, we can optimally adapt our offer to the wishes of you, our Client. The session cookies are automatically deleted from the Clientâs hard drive at the end of the browser session. However, glomex GmbH also uses cookies that remain permanently on the User's hard drive. These cookies are required for identifying the Visitor upon his next visit and for determining which settings and entries the specific User requires. These cookies remain on the hard drive and delete themselves automatically after the predetermined period of time.</p>
<p>If you activate auto login, the respective page of our online offer will also set a cookie, which, in this case, will store your registration data in order to identify you the next time you use the service so that you do not have to login again. The User can deactivate the auto login at any time after activating it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) Which data is contained in the cookies?</p>
<p>Through the cookies, information on certain usage behavior, visited pages of the glomex GmbH services etc. is stored. However, no personal data is stored. Therefore, the stored cookies do not make it possible to link usage behavior to a specific or identifiable person. When cookies are used, encoded numbers are assigned to them. Name, IP address, addresses and other personal data, however, are not contained in these cookies and the cookie ID numbers can never be linked to personal data. The information transferred to glomex GmbH is generalized in such a manner that we only obtain information on what sites have been visited, which films have been viewed or which individual pages on the homepage have been clicked on. This information is only transferred and stored under a pseudonym , which cannot be linked to the name. Thus, the storage only serves for an internal assessment of the efficiency of contents on the pages of glomex GmbH and not for the analysis of personal usage behavior of identifiable individual Users.</p>
<p>d) Are third-party cookies or respectively web beacons and user-based online advertising used as well?</p>
<p>The advertisements in this offer are optimized for you, taking into consideration your predicted interests, through the anonymous collection and processing of your usage behavior. To this end, third-parties place cookies on your computer on our behalf, which collect your usage data. This means data that can be collected while you are, for example, visiting the pages of this online offer or clicking on advertisements. Thus, we are able to analyze the use of online advertisements, which might be interesting to you and correspond to your preferences (âusage-based online advertisingâ). Personal data (such as name, address, email address) will never be stored in this context. If IP addresses are collected, they will be anonymized so that they cannot be linked to any individual user.</p>
<p>If you do no longer wish to obtain user-based online advertisements, you may prevent the placement or respectively storage of cookies through your browser settings.</p>
<p>glomex GmbH has voluntarily subjected itself to the self-regulation of the Deutsche Datenschutzrat Online-Werbung (DDOW) [German data protection council for online advertising].

<p>Moreover, we allow other third parties, for example media agencies, to place cookies in order to analyze the usage of online advertisements and to present to you special advertisements in our online offer that are based on your preferences and might interest you. In addition, we seek to enable the media agencies to address the target groups of their advertisers as precisely as possible, without any major losses due to non-selective advertising. To this end, e.g. anonymous user statistics are prepared and the data is used for market research purposes. It is not possible to track the data back to an individual user. You may also prevent the placement of third-party cookies through the respective browsers settings.</p>
<p>Our website uses the âScalable Central Measurement Methodâ (SCM) of INFOnline GmbH (<a href="http://www.infonline.de">http://www.infonline.de</a> for the determination of statistical values regarding the usage of our offer.</p>
<p>In this context, anonymous measurement values are collected. In order to be able to recognize computer systems, the SCM range measurement uses either a cookie with the identifier âioam.deâ or âivwbox.deâ, or a localStorage object or a signature created from various pieces of automatically transferred information of your browser. IP addresses are only processed in anonymized form.</p>
<p>The range measurement was developed in compliance with data protection. The object of range measurement is to determine the usage intensity and the number of users of a website.</p>
<p>Individual users will never be identified. Your identity is protected at all times and you will not receive any advertisement through this system.</p>

&nbsp;<br>e) What is on-site targeting? <br><br>On the web pages of glomex GmbH, data is stored by means of the above mentioned cookies (session cookies and temporary cookies) in order to optimize advertisements. However, in this case as well, the data cannot be linked to the individual person. It is merely collected data for the optimization of the website. The data is used to make it possible to provide advertisement/special offers and services tailored to the respective user. Thus, the offer is even more attractive to the Client and can be used in a better and more user-friendly manner. This is the only way to provide advertisement/services tailored to the interests of the respective Client. Thus, the Client only receives advertisement that he is interested in and not a wide range of general advertisement. Apart from this, the Client may, of course, withdraw his consent to receiving advertisement in general.<br><br>f) What is retargeting?<br><br>Retargeting works similar to on-site targeting. The essential difference between the two is that re-targeting also involves third-party companies. The service of glomex GmbH also uses so-called retargeting software. Through this technology, advertisement may also be addressed to the User when he is visiting the webpages of the partners of glomex GmbH. Thus, the User can be provided with advertisement in accordance with his interests even beyond the range of services of glomex GmbH. To this end as well, the above mentioned cookies (session cookies and temporary cookies), which readout the previous usage behavior, are used. In this case, too, the data stored or forwarded cannot be linked to an individual User. The partner of glomex GmbH does not receive any personal data of the User either. Advertisement is merely displayed on the pages of the partners as well, without the data (cookies storing the usage behavior) being linked to the personal data of an identifiable individual.

<p><strong>5. Use of so-called social plugins</strong></p>
<strong>Facebook</strong><br>
<p>Facebook Social plugins of the social network <a href="http://www.facebook.com">www.facebook.com</a>, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S.California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (âFacebookâ), are integrated into the webpages of this offer. Examples of such so-called social plugins are the Facebook recommendation function, the Facebook âLikeâ button, the Facebook âShareâ button, the Facebook âLivestreamâ and the Facebook comments box. These functions are constantly further developed and extended by Facebook. Such a so-called social plugin is marked by means of a clearly visible Facebook logo (e.g. a white âfâ on a blue square or a âthumbs upâ symbol) or by the addition âFacebook social pluginâ. If a respective webpage containing such so-called social plugins is opened, the User's browser establishes a direct connection with the Facebook servers. If the User is registered with Facebook and logged into his Facebook user account, Facebook will receive the information that the respective webpage was opened by the User. If&nbsp;the User actively uses a so-called social plugin, for example by clicking on the âLikeâ or the âShareâ button, or by leaving a comment in the comments box on the respective webpage, the corresponding information will be directly transmitted by the Userâs browser to Facebook, where it will be used. If the User wants to prevent Facebook from collecting the above mentioned information when he opens a respective webpage, we recommend that the User obtain information in this regard on the Facebook website and/or logout from Facebook before opening a page with a so-called social plugin. In addition, the User might have to delete existing cookies from Facebook from its own browser.</p>
