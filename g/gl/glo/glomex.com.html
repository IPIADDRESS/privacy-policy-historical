III.	Cookies<br>
<br>
Cookies are little text files that are sent when visiting an internet page and are stored in a user’s browser. In case the respective internet page is accessed once again, the user’s browser sends back the content of the cookies and, thus, allows for the recognition of the user. Certain cookies are automatically deleted upon ending the browser session (so-called session cookies), others are saved for a set time or permanently in the user’s browser and delete themselves thereafter (so-called temporary or persistent cookies).<br>
Cookies generally do not contain personal data, but merely an online ID. You can deactivate the storage of cookies through your browser settings and you may delete cookies that have already been saved in your browser at any time (see Technical Notes). Please take note that this online offer might not be functional without cookies or the functionality might be reduced.<br>
<br>
Please be further advised that refusing to allow the creation of usage profiles partially works through „opt-out cookies“. In case you delete all cookies, an objection might, under certain circumstances, no longer be considered or be valid and would have to be restated. <br>
<br>
1.	Own use of cookies<br>
<br>
We use the following types of cookies:<br>
<br>
•	Cookies strictly necessary for our service <br>
<br>
Some cookies are strictly necessary so we can host our online offer safely. This category includes, e.g.,<br>
<br>
o	Cookies which serve the purpose of identifying or authenticating our users;<br>
o	Cookies that temporarily store certain user entries (e.g., shopping basket content or content of an online form);<br>
o	Cookies that remember certain user preferences (e.g., search query and language settings);<br>
o	Cookies that store data to ensure the uninterrupted playback of video and audio content<br>
<br>
•	Analytic Cookies<br>
<br>
We use analytic cookies to record and statistically evaluate our users’ usage behavior (e.g., clicked ad banners, visited subpages, search queries asked).<br>
<br>
<br>
2.	Web Analysis<br>
<br>
We need statistical information on how to use our online offering to make it more user-friendly, measure reach and conduct market research. For this purpose we use the following analysis tools. The usage profiles created by the tools using analytic cookies or by evaluating the log files are not merged with personal data. The providers of the tools process data only as a processor according to our instructions and not for their own purposes. The tools either do not use users' IP addresses at all, or truncate them immediately after the survey.<br>
<br>
For each tool you will find information about the respective provider and how you can object to the collection and processing of data by the tool. In the case of tools that implement the contradiction by means of opt-out cookies, it should be noted that the opt-out function is device-specific or browser-related and basically only applies to the terminal or browser used. If you use multiple devices or browsers, you must set the opt-out on each individual device and in each browser used.<br>
In addition, you can prevent the creation of usage profiles for analysis purposes altogether by generally preventing the use of cookies.<br>
<br>
2.1	Google Analytics<br>
<br>
Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland ("Google") for users from the European Economic Area, Switzerland and Liechtenstein and by Google LLC 1600, Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043 ("Google") for all other users.<br>
<br>
Google Analytics uses cookies and similar technologies to analyze and improve our website on the basis of your user behavior. Google may transmit the data collected thereby to a server in the US where it will be assessed and saved. For transmissions of personal data to the US, Google subjected itself to the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome"><b><font color="#0055af"> EU-US Privacy Shield </font></b></a>. However, your IP address will be shortened prior to assessing usage statistics so that you cannot be identified. For this, Google Analytics uses the extension “anonymizeIP” on our website to ensure that IP addresses are collected anonymously.<br>
Google will process the information provided by the cookies to assess your use of this website, to compile reports about website activity and to perform additional services related to use of the website and the Internet.<br>
<br>
As described above, you may configure your browser to reject cookies. You may also prevent the collection of cookie-generated data on your use of this website (incl. your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing a browser add-on provided by Google or, when accessing our website from a mobile device, activating this opt-out link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en"><b><font color="#0055af"> Deaktivieren Sie Google Analytics </font></b></a>. This will prevent the collection of data by Google Analytics on this website (the opt-out cookie will only work on the browser used and only for this domain). If you delete your cookies from this browser, you must activate this link again.<br>
For more information, please see <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en"><b><font color="#0055af"> Google's Privacy Policy </font></b></a>.<br>

2.2	Hotjar<br>
<br>
Our website uses Hotjar, a web analysis service by Hotjar Ltd, Elia Zammit Street 3, St Julians STJ 1000, Malta ("Hotjar"). Hotjar is used to create heat maps. Heat Maps graphically display statistics about mouse movements and clicks on our site. This allows us to recognize frequently used functions on our website and to further improve the page. Hotjar uses cookies and similar technologies to analyze our website with regard to your user behavior. However, your IP address is shortened before the usage statistics are evaluated so that no conclusions can be drawn about your identity. In addition to mouse movements and clicks, information on the operating system, browser, incoming and outgoing links, geographical origin, resolution and type of device are evaluated for statistical purposes. This information is pseudonymous and will not be shared with third parties by us or Hotjar. Data entered by you in form fields on our website will be hidden and not collected by Hotjar.<br>
<br>
The collection of data by Hotjar can be deactivated on all websites operated by us or other providers that use Hotjar through your objection (so-called opt-out). You will find more detailed explanations and a function to explain your objection on the <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/legal/compliance/opt-out"><b><font color="#0055af"> Hotjar Opt-Out page </font></b></a>. In addition, Hotjar supports the so-called Do-Not-Track function of your browser. If you enable this in your browser, Hotjar will not collect any data. You can find instructions for the different browsers on the Hotjar website. <br>

<br>
IV.	Transfer of personal data<br>
<br>
The data we collect on you will only be transferred if:<br>
<br>
•	You provided your express consent <br>
<br>
•	The transfer is required for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims and if there is no reason to believe that you have an overriding interest in the non-disclosure of your data,<br>
<br>
•	We are required by law to transfer your data or if<br>
<br>
•	Permitted by law and required for the performance of a contractual relationship with you or for pre-contractual measures requested by you.<br>
Furthermore, your personal data may be transferred if required by public authorities, court orders or legal proceedings if necessary for litigation or legal defense.<br>
Data processing may partially be performed by our service providers. In addition to the service providers stated in this Privacy Policy, this may especially include data centers, software providers (e.g., for log file management or sending newsletters), IT service providers, help desks, agencies, market research companies, group companies and consulting firms. If we transfer data to our service providers, the service providers may only use this data for the performance of their tasks. Service providers are diligently selected and commissioned by us. If these service providers process your data outside of the European Union, your data may be transferred to a country with lower data protection standards than in the European Union. For such cases, glomex ensures that the respective service providers guarantee an equal level of data protection (e.g., by concluding Standard Contractual Clauses with the service provider or through certification of the service provider under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield). You may receive copies of these guarantees from our Data Protection Officer (see Contact section above).<br>
<br>
V.	 Storage Duration<br>
<br>
We will only save your personal data for as long as required for the fulfillment of the contractual or legal obligations for which we collected your data. Afterwards, we will delete your data without delay, unless we need your data as evidence for civil law purposes or until the legal storage period expires. We are required to save your contract data as evidence for three years after the end of the year in which our business relationship with you ends. Any claims will expire at the earliest date permitted by the statute of limitations. However, we may have to save your data for longer for accounting or for other legally required purposes. We may be required to do so due to legal documentation obligations, e.g., under the German Commercial Code [Handelsgesetzbuch] or the German Fiscal Code [Abgabenordnung].<br>
<br>
VI.	Data subjects‘ rights<br>
<br>
You have the right to receive information about the processing of your personal data by us at any time. We will explain the data processing to you and provide an overview of personal data saved on you by us. If personal data saved by us is inaccurate or no longer up to date, you have the right to rectification of this data. You also have the right to erasure of your data. You also have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data if, e.g., you contest the accuracy of the data. You also have the right to data portability, i.e., we will provide you with a digital copy of the personal data we saved on you if requested. You also have the right to object to data processing if based on our legitimate interests. Our newsletters include unsubscribe links. To exercise your rights described above, you may use the information in the Contact section above. Please make sure that we can clearly identify you.<br>
<br>
You also have the right to submit complaints to our competent data protection supervisory authority (Bayerisches Landesamt für Datenschutzaufsicht - BayLDA, Promenade 27, D-91522 Ansbach poststelle@lda.bayern.de) or to the data protection authority of your habitual residence who will forward your inquiry to the competent authority.

                  <p>Privacy Policy for the glomex-Player<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy is to inform you about the functioning and processing of personal data when using the glomex player embedded in a third party’s online service. glomex offers a wide range of free video content which publishers can embed in their online service. Providing free premium video content to end users is only possible by showing targeted ads to the end user during the use of the glomex player. On the basis of pseudonymized data, glomex works with advertising partners to deploy advertising in the glomex player in a more targeted manner based on the end user’s interests and surfing habits. The glomex player will always be embdedded in a third party’s online service (e.g. a website). Please therefore also note the respective third party‘s individual privacy notice for more information on how this third party is processig personal data <br>

<br>
<br>
1. Provider of the glomex player<br>
<br>
The glomex player is provided by glomex GmbH, Dieselstrasse 1, 85774 Unterfoehring, Germany, e-mail: info[at]glomex.com . <br>
<br>
Should you have any questions regarding data protection in connection with the glomex player, you can contact glomex‘s data protection officer by writing to the postal address provided.<br>
<br>
2. Data processing in connection with the glomex player<br>
<br>
2.1 glomex only uses pseudonyms. Personal data means any information that can be attributed to a person, such as name, age, email address, telephone number or information about website usage and interactions with advertising. In principle, glomex‘s services do not involve the storing of any information about viewers in clear text. glomex does not know the name, address or email address of the the glomex player’s audiene. All information processed by glomex is recorded, stored and evaluated using temporary identifiers (pseudonyms) that glomex cannot decipher or re-identify. <br>
<br>
2.2 Purposes of data processing in the glomex player. When an end user starts a video in the glomex player, glomex provides video content from its content owners via an integration service and combines it with ads targeted from varying advertising partners. glomex tracks the usage of the glomex player component for billing purposes and user experience improvements and is responsible for these data processing activities. Each advertising partner who works with glomex to deploy advertising to the end user by means of placing cookies to glomex’s services is individually responsible for the associated data processing activity (please see section 3 below).<br>
<br>
2.3 Categories of data processed in connection with the glomex player. The provision of the content combined with relevant advertising is generally implemented using IP addresses, cookies and comparable technologies (hereinafter also referred to as “identifiers”). <br>
<br>
Through the glomex player, glomex collects collects the following usage data:<br>
<br>
– current IP address of the device (pseudonymized by removing the last range part of the IP address)<br>
<br>
– billing and player performance data (such as Video Views, Ad Impressions, multiple usage events)<br>
<br>
– information about the region or location where the player is currently being used<br>
<br>
– technical data about the device and operating system used<br>
<br>
– where applicable, general information on the user groups (such as age, gender and interests)<br>
<br>
– other identifiers in encrypted form (such as userIDs and userSessionIDs)<br>
<br>
Our advertising partners (see also section 3 below) also use additional identifiers (e.g. cookies) to collect information about your activities in the glomex player and on third-party websites to match collected pseudonymized usage data regarding you as a viewer of the glomex player so that advertisements targeted to your browser activities and interests can be delivered to you in the glomex player.<br>
<br>
If a viewer clicks on the deployed advertising, for example to reach the advertised online service, this is recorded by glomex. Here glomex does not know the identity of the viewers, but by means of the identifiers can only recognise those viewers who have previously received one of the deployed ads. glomex receives this data about interactions with ads and the pseudonymized IP addresses, so that it can use this data to bill for its own services with customers, to enable billing verification, to prevent adblocking, to create statistical overviews for customers and to measure the reach and efficiency of ads for glomex‘s customers. glomex also uses the usage data and data about interactions with ads to troubleshoot and to improve its own services, e.g. in the context of anonymous evaluations.<br>
<br>
3. Data recipients. glomex only discloses data to third parties if this is necessary for the deployment of ads and the implementation of campaigns or other purposes listed in this privacy notice or if another legal basis for the disclosure of the data exists. The collection, storage and disclosure of usage data by the advertising partners in which the ad space is deployed are controlled by and the exclusive responsibility of the respective advertising partners. glomex currently works with the following advertising partners to monetize the provided video content:<br>

<br>
In principle, glomex only passes on pseudonymized data to third parties, and never names, email addresses or other contact data. <br>
<br>
If glomex uses external service providers and discloses data to them, they may only use the data to fulfil their task and in connection with specific instructions. The service providers are contractually bound to the data protection requirements. In cases where data are processed in countries outside the European Union, appropriate safeguards are in place to protect data subjects. A copy of the appropriate safeguards can be requested from the address given in section 1.<br>
<br>
4. Retention periods. glomex stores some identifiers only for a very limited period of time (e.g. one day upon the use of the player), while others identifiers are stored longer (e.g. 2 years) in order to recognize returning users. Pseudonymized IP addresses may be stored for longer time periods for billing verification and fraud prevention purposes. If you have opted out in accordance with section 8 below, we will retain your information to enable us to comply with your preferences.<br>
<br>
5. Legal bases. We will process your personal data <br>
<br>
•	for the purpose of legitimate interests pursued by us or <br>
<br>
•	because you have consented to the processing.<br>
<br>
Our legitimate interests include storing and accessing information necessary to provide the services; selecting, delivering and reporting on the effectiveness of advertisements; measuring the performance of advertisements and campaigns, preventing adblocking, personalizing the advertisements you receive and allowing our advertising partners to personalize the advertisements in the glomex player; and investigating and preventing fraud.

Under the GDPR, you have a number of rights in relation to their personal data. These rights are not absolute – in some cases they will not apply to you or to the particular use that we are making of your data, and there are exceptions (for example if we have to process the data to comply with our own legal obligations), but if that is the case we will let you know. <br>

Controlling and Reporting.</b> We also use information on orders and invoice items for internal cost and performance accounting, controlling and internal reporting, which we use for corporate management and forecasting. The legal basis is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. In this context, no personal data is processed.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Direct marketing activities.</b> We use our Business Partner Data and Business Partner Contact Data as well as information on previous orders, if applicable, in order to send you further relevant information on our products and services, as well as related news, promotions and offers. These will be sent to you by post or e-mail. To contact you, we use the contact data you have provided us with. The legal basis for the aforementioned data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR based on our legitimate interest to promote our services to customers and business partners. You can object to the use of your Business Partner Contact Data for direct marketing purposes at any time by sending us an email or letter (see contact details under „Data Privacy Contact“). In addition, we offer the glomex newsletter, which informs you regularly about our technologies, products and solutions and their applications. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time via the unsubscribe link contained in each newsletter. The legal basis for the aforementioned data processing is Art. 6 (1)(a) GDPR.<br>
<br>
<b>4. Categories of recipients.</b> The Business Partner Data as well as the Business Partner Contact Data will generally be processed solely by glomex. Exceptionally, data may be passed on to third parties if required or stipulated by law (e.g. as part of a tax audit by the tax authorities or as part of money laundering prevention). In certain cases, it is necessary to pass on Business Partner Data or Business Partner Contact Data to third parties in order to protect your or our interests or to fulfil our contractual obligations (e.g. to reimburse our business partners for their services via our glomex partners). Such disclosure also occurs when we involve external service providers in our internal processes. In these cases, the service provider is bound by instructions and receives data only to the extent and for the period necessary for the provision of the services. In addition, we sometimes employ external consultants and auditors. Agreements are always concluded with them to ensure the confidentiality of all information. If personal data is transferred outside of the European Economic Area, we ensure that appropriate safeguards to ensure an adequate level of protection in third countries are in place (e.g. <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome"><b><font color="#0055af"> EU-US Privacy Shield </font></b></a>, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en"><b><font color="#0055af"> Standard Contractual Clauses </font></b></a> etc.).<br>
<br>
<b>5. Your rights.</b> At any time, you have the right<br>
•	to request access to or a copy of any personal data which we hold about you;<br>
•	to rectification of your personal data, if you consider that the information we are holding is inaccurate;<br>
•	to ask us to delete your personal data, if you consider that we do not have the right to hold it;<br>
•	to withdraw consent to our processing of your personal data (to the extent such processing is based on previously obtained consent);<br>
•	to restrict processing of your personal data;<br>
•	to data portability in certain circumstances;<br>
•	to object to your personal data being processed in certain circumstances and to object to the processing of your data for direct marketing purposes. <br>
You also have the right to file a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority responsible for glomex (Data Protection Authority of Bavaria for the Private Sector / Bayerisches Landesamt für Datenschutzaufsicht, Postfach 606, 91511 Ansbach, Germany). If you are a resident of a member state in the European Economic Area, you are also free to contact your local data protection authority.</p>
