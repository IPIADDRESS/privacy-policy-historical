		<p>Effective Date January 1, 2004</p>

		<p>This statement discloses the privacy practices for the GlobalSurveyGroup.com website. By visiting GlobalSurveyGroup.com, you are 
		accepting the practices described herein. Because Global Survey Group wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed 
		to disclose its information practices and notify you of the following:</p>

		<h4>What information do we collect?</h4>

		<p>The information we collect helps us ensure that our services are best designed to meet your needs. We receive and store any 
		information that you enter on any registration page. Typically these will be registration forms for contests, surveys or other 
		promotions. If you are giving us information in order to participate in a survey, contest or other promotion, your participation is 
		completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. If some information is required and 
		some is optional, we will identify the required information. We collect both contact and other information.</p>

		<p>A. Contact Information</p>

		<p>Contact information consists of the information that we can use to contact you if, for example, you win one of the contests 
		or promotions sponsored by Global Survey Group and/or its affiliates and partners. This consists of your name, your e-mail 
		address, IP address and possibly your mailing address, telephone and facsimile number. Visitors who supply GlobalSurveyGroup.com 
		with their postal address may receive periodic postal mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming 
		events. They may also receive mailings from other reputable companies. </p>

		<p>B. Other Information</p>

		<p>Profile data also is collected at our site. Depending on the specific Global Survey Group products for which a user ("User") 
		registers, various information will be requested. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience through our interest-focused 
		e-mails. By obtaining this information, we can provide our Users with specific content that we think they might be interested in, 
		according to their preferences and interests. The User may include only the information he or she feels comfortable including. 
		However, the omission of certain information may limit the value of the experience for the User. As a result, the more information 
		we have about a User, the more valuable the Global Survey Group experience will be for that User. In addition, GlobalSurveyGroup.com 
		provides services for direct marketing applications including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation.</p>

		<h4>How is User information used?</h4>

		<p>A. Information that you provide</p>

		<p>Global Survey Group does not send unsolicited or "spam" e-mail. We use User information in a number of ways, including:</p>

		<p>1) to send personalized, targeted information to the User in the form of e-mail messages and/or direct mail;<br>
		2) to send targeted advertising that allows us to provide our service at no or little cost to the Users;<br>
		3) to send promotions and coupons based on their interests;<br>
		4) to contact Users for feedback and surveys;<br>
		5) to monitor and improve its internal operations, as well as to ensure that it properly performs the services requested and 
		bills properly where appropriate; and<br>
		6) to send Users other information about Global Survey Group and/or its products.</p>

		<p>When you register with Global Survey Group, you may receive offers from us or our marketing partners. Our marketing partners 
		may use this information to make offers to you in your areas of interest or other offers. Our marketing partners wishing to 
		contact you either give their e-mail message to us and we deliver it to you, or with your prior permission, we provide your 
		contact information to them so they can deliver messages directly to you. It is solely at your discretion if you choose to provide 
		additional personally identifiable information to a marketer by making a purchase, requesting additional information, or 
		communicating directly with the company or organization after using its website. We may also use outside companies to execute 
		the marketing campaigns on our behalf or on behalf of some of our marketing partners. We will share your e-mail name &amp; other 
		information that you give us that is necessary for these third parties to provide these services. These third parties are not 
		allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purposes of providing these services.</p>

		<p>B. Automatic Information ("Cookies")</p>

		<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the User's hard drive containing information about the User. Usage of a cookie is in 
		no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on the Global Survey Group Site. For instance, by setting a 
		cookie on our site, the User would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a 
		User rejects the cookie, he or she may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the User will be limited in some 
		areas of the Global Survey Group Sites. For example, the User may not be able to participate in selected Sweepstakes, 
		promotions, surveys, contests or monthly Drawings that take place. Cookies also can enable us to track and target the 
		interests of our Users to enhance their experience on the Global Survey Group Site.</p>

		<p>You can set your browser to not accept cookies. Please be aware that by doing so certain features of the Global Survey 
		Group Site may not work. See your browser's documentation for more information on accepting cookies.</p>

		<p>Global Survey Group uses cookies to collect and store certain types of information when you interact with us in 
		order to (i) access your account information (stored on our computers) and keep track of your points or credits; 
		and (ii) learn what you like and, hence, to provide a more personalized experience for you. In the future, Global 
		Survey Group may use cookies to enable us or a merchant to track visits to and business at its store and process 
		the items in your shopping basket. Global Survey Group strongly encourages all of its merchants to post their privacy 
		policies on their sites and to adhere to the same high standards as stated herein.</p>

		<p>C. Log Files

		</p><p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track User's movement, and gather broad demographic 
		information for aggregate use. While we collect standard Apache log files, we do not use them for any purpose other than 
		determining page views. We also collect pages visited within our database through cookies (as discussed above). This 
		data is connected with registration information so we can determine site usage and for marketing research. Except in 
		the case of domain name registrations, IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>

		<h4>Does Global Survey Group share information it collects?</h4>

		<p>A. Registration Information</p>

		<p>As part of the registration process, we often offer you the option to take advantage of one or more offers from our 
		partners. Those offers are optional and you do not have to sign-up for any offers in order to participate in the main 
		promotional offer (although you may need to check or uncheck certain boxes to do so). If you do choose to sign-up for 
		an offer, we will share information about you with those selected partners from whom you have chosen to receive information.</p>

		<p>When you register with Global Survey Group, you can elect to sign up with some of our marketing partners so they 
		may contact you with their special offers. It is solely at your discretion if you choose to provide additional personally 
		identifiable information to a marketer by making a purchase, requesting additional information, or communicating directly 
		with the company or organization after using its website. We may share this information with a third-party advertising 
		company in order to market more effectively to you.</p>

		<p>We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf (e.g., outsourced e-mail delivery 
		companies). They have access to the User information to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</p>

		<p>B. Referral Program</p>

		<p>As part of some of our referral programs, we request contact information (like the name and e-mail address) of 
		visitors' friends and family whom they think would like to receive a Global Survey Group service. The persons 
		referred to us will receive sample Global Survey Group e-mails, but do not become subscribers until they confirm 
		their interest in the service. Global Survey Group stores this information for the sole purpose of sending the emails 
		regarding Global Survey Group services. The person referred also can unsubscribe at any time; see "What Choices Do I Have," below.</p>

		<p>C. Links To Other Sites</p>

		<p>This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. As part of our business, we also 
		provide links to third party sites. We encourage all of our merchants to post their privacy policies on their sites and 
		to adhere to the same high standard as is stated here. We, however, disclaim any responsibility for the actions of these 
		third parties. AS A RESULT, WE ENCOURAGE OUR USERS TO READ THE PRIVACY POLICIES OF THESE LINKED SITES, BECAUSE THEIR PRIVACY 
		POLICIES MAY DIFFER FROM OURS.</p>

		<p>D. Protection of Global Survey Group and Others</p>

		<p>We may release User or account information as is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms and 
		Conditions and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Global Survey Group, its 
		subsidiaries, affiliates or partners, our Users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other 
		companies and organizations for fraud protection.</p>
		
		<h4>What Choices do I have?</h4>

		<p>A. Choices In Disclosing Information</p>

		<p>Because we want our Users to feel completely comfortable using the Global Survey Group services, we provide you 
		with various opportunities to control how the information you provide to us will be used by us. We request information 
		from our customers' registration, as well as via surveys or contests or other promotions. Your participation in these 
		activities is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Nevertheless, 
		certain basic information is required in order to register as a User. Information requested may include contact information, 
		and demographic information. You also may choose whether or not to get e-mails from Global Survey Group and whether or 
		not to accept special offers from our partners. If you choose not to receive e-mail from Global Survey Group we will not 
		send you e-mail, although it may take a short time to remove your name from our database.</p>

		<p>Please note once an account is created, we may send you a confirmation e-mail acknowledging your new account to the 
		address that you supplied us. This e-mail will give you the option to unsubscribe your account, in case you change your 
		mind or in case you were not the one who created it in the first place. You should keep the confirmation e-mail, as it 
		will also contain information that will help you in case you run into problems accessing our services.</p>

		<p>B. Opting Out

		</p><p>To remove your User information from our mailing list(s) so as not to receive future communications from us or to no 
		longer receive our service, please go to: http://www.globalsurveygroup.com/unsub.php and enter your email address. If you 
		have submitted personal information under more than one e-mail account, you must make this request from each account that 
		you have used. Global Survey Group will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete records from our mailing list when 
		we receive requests to do so. Please allow up to 48 hours to be completely removed from our database. This Privacy Policy 
		is subject to change from time to time, so please check back periodically. Use of the services offered at this site 
		constitutes acceptance of the terms of this Policy.</p>

		<h4>How secure is my information?</h4>

		<p>The information we receive from or about you is stored on systems designed to prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorized 
		access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of that information. In addition, certain of the Global Survey Group Sites 
		encrypt your transmission of sensitive information to it (e.g., credit card numbers, account passwords) in the interest of 
		heightened privacy protection and information integrity. Financial information is stored in a secure location that is 
		accessible only by designated staff and used only for the purposes for which you provide the information.</p>

		<p>While we strive to protect your personal information, Global Survey Group cannot ensure or warrant the security of any 
		information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. In addition, Global Survey Group and third party Internet sites 
		and services accessible through Global Survey Group or parties whom we inform you are collecting data in connection with 
		contests, games, promotions, etc., have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of us. Global Survey 
		Group has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions. You are solely responsible for maintaining 
		the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.</p>
