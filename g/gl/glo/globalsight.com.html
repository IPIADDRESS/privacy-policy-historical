      <p>This policy has been developed to comply with the Irish Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 and the
        European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Data Protection and Privacy)
        Regulations 2003. For information on Irish data protection legislation and the Data Protection
        Commissioner, please follow this link: <a href="http://www.dataprivacy.ie." target="_blank">www.dataprivacy.ie</a></p>

      <p>In general, Transware does not collect, store, use or disclose personal information except for
        information which you volunteer in certain circumstances, such as, for example, when you register
        with us to obtain access to certain know-how that we make available on our website.. Whenever we
        collect such information, you will have a choice regarding whether to provide it, how it will be
        used, and to whom it will be disclosed. The instances in which Transware does collect and use
        information are specifically described in this policy.</p>

      <p>Transware provides certain services on its website, including information and support resources
        (the “Services”). The Services may also be located on third party Web sites and/or
        applications. The Services are made available by Transware plc and its subsidiaries and associated
        companies (collectively “Transware”). Transware values its users and takes seriously
        concerns about their privacy. To this end, Transware applies in consistent data processing
        practices and uses its best efforts to make clear disclosures regarding such practices.</p>

      <h2>What does this policy cover?</h2>
      <p>This policy applies to collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by Transware. Where, 
        in specific circumstances we depart from the terms of this policy, we will explain the nature of 
        that departure and give you an opportunity to choose not to participate or provide the information. 
        By using the Services and our website, you consent to the collection and use of your information as 
        outlined in this policy.</p>

      <p>Transware may decide to change this policy from time to time. When we do, we will make the amended 
        policy available on our website. Please be aware that, as part of the Services, Transware provides 
        links to websites operated by third parties. Transware is not responsible for content, the 
        information collection or privacy practices of third party websites.</p>

      <h2>What information does Transware collect?  How is it used? Does Transware disclose information to 
        third parties?</h2>
      <p>Transware may collect any or all of the following four types of information: (a) traffic or 
        clickstream data, (b) cookies, (c) pixel tags or (d) contact information and other personal 
        information. Transware's collection and use of each type of data is described below, as well as the 
        ways (if any) in which the data may be shared with third parties. Please note that Transware may 
        transfer any information in its possession to any third party in connection with a sale of all or 
        a substantial part of the assets of the company, a sale of the company or a merger.</p>

      <p><strong>(a) Traffic or Clickstream Data.</strong> Anonymous/statistical data about traffic and
        usage which does not include personal information and is not supplemented or combined with
        personally identifying or identifiable information. Transware may freely share information it
        collects with third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form. Transware collects some
        information regarding use of the Services by observing browser functions and the files users
        access. For example, Transware's servers may collect anonymous information about the site from
        which you entered to counter fraud and to identify areas and issues of common interest to
        visitors to our website in order to improve the experience we offer.  In addition to the
        foregoing applications, Transware uses the information (in aggregate form) to better design the
        Services.</p>

      <p><strong>(b) Cookies.</strong> Like many organisations, Transware collects information about
        online behaviour using cookies. These cookies contain identification information that enables
        us to see how our users are interacting with our site and how frequently they are returning,
        as well as to evaluate and improve their experience of our Services and to help diagnose
        problems with our servers. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information.
        Cookies let us know about repeat visitors and the Services are useful and relevant.</p>

      <p>Transware may also use cookies to identify which sites our repeat visitors are coming from so
        that we can provide the most relevant and useful information to users of our website.. To
        Transware, using information within cookies is an anonymous way to evaluate and improve our
        Services.</p>

      <p>Finally, we may offer you the ability to have easier access to password-protected areas of
        our website by giving you the opportunity to access such areas automatically using a cookie 
        which we would set on your computer.</p>

      <p>You may set your browser software to reject cookies, but this may restrict your access to the 
        Services. Transware may share information about usage of the Services with third parties, but 
        only in aggregated, anonymous form.</p>

      <p><strong>(c) Contact Information and other Personal Information.</strong> Transware obtains 
        access to your name, e-mail address and other contact information only (1) when you contact us, 
        provide comments, submit a problem, or request information from Transware and provide your 
        name and return contact information (including address, e-mail, telephone and/or fax numbers), 
        (2) in connection with special offers, promotions or competitions, or (3) when you provide 
        such personal information to access certain restricted areas of our website, to indicate your 
        interest in partnering with Transware or to express your interest in sealing employment with 
        Transware.</p>

      <p>Transware may share information with companies who work on our behalf to provide certain 
        services, such as email processing and delivery and conducting research and analysis. These 
        companies will be prohibited from using this information for any other purpose or from sharing 
        this information with other companies.</p>

      <p>Transware may also use personal information held by it to respond to legal process, such as, 
        search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against 
        legal claims.</p>

      <p>Contact information provided in connection with problems, comments or requests is used only to 
        respond to those problems, comments or requests. Unless you expressly otherwise agree, this 
        information is not used in connection with traffic or clickstream data and is provided to third 
        parties only as necessary to respond to the comment, problem or request.</p>

      <p>Finally, you may choose to provide contact information, other personal information, and 
        demographic information in order to participate in optional surveys or contests, which are run 
        for promotional purposes. Transware uses such information to send you information about its 
        products in accordance with the terms and conditions attaching to such surveys or contests (to 
        which you will be asked specifically to consent) and to notify you if you win the contest. When 
        you give us your personal information, we will give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving 
        information from us regarding Transware or Transware's business partners by post or telephone 
        and either give you the opportunity to opt in to receive such information by electronic means 
        (including e-mail, fax or SMS) or notify you that the provision of your personal information 
        will be taken to constitute opting in to receiving such information by electronic means.</p>

      <p>By returning or submitting a form with your personal information to us, you consent to (a) our 
        processing your Sensitive Information for the above purposes (but see further below; and (b) 
        our transferring your information to countries which may provide a lesser standard of data 
        protection than either Ireland or your country of residence if necessary for the above purposes. 
        If we do make such a transfer we will put a contract in place to ensure your personal 
        information is protected.</p>

      <p><strong>(d) CVs and resumes.</strong> If you opt to apply for employment with Transware or to 
        send us your CV or resume in connection with any such application or otherwise, we will forward 
        such information to our HR Personnel who will hold and process the information on a strictly 
        confidential basis.  Please note, however, that the internet is not a secure communications 
        medium and we accept no liability for any breach of confidentiality arising directly or 
        indirectly from transmission of your personal information via the internet.</p>

      <p>Where you send us information such as CVs or resumes, we hold such information on file for up to 
        two years from the date of receipt by us.  This is to allow us to maintain your details on file 
        and to contact you in the event a job vacancy becomes available.  You may, at any time, contact us 
        to request the deletion from our files of your CV or resume.  If we wish to retain your CV, resume 
        or other similar document beyond the term of two years stated above (e.g. where we anticipate a 
        suitable job vacancy arising within the two year period referred to above), we will contact you (as 
        outlined below) to seek your consent to such retention.</p>

      <p>It is your responsibility to ensure that the contact information outlined in your CV, resume or 
        any associated correspondence is confidential and we reserve the right to contact you (generally 
        and in connection with job applications you make to us) using any means of contact information 
        which you furnish to us.  Accordingly, we recommend that a private e-mail address is used when 
        submitting CVs, resumes or other similar personal information.</p>

      <h2>What information does Transware not collect?</h2>
      <p>We do not seek to or intentionally collect Sensitive Data. Our procedures and systems are not 
        established or equipped to receive or handle appropriately Sensitive Data which you may send to us. 
        We will never ask you for Sensitive Data in connection with the use of the Services. Accordingly, 
        you agree and undertake not to provide Transware with Sensitive Data relating to you or to any 
        other person and indemnify Transware against any liability arising from the provision by you of 
        such Sensitive Data. For the purposes of this policy, Sensitive Data constitutes sensitive personal

      <h2>Is personal information stored by Transware secure?</h2>
      <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data integrity, and ensure the appropriate use of personal 
      information, Transware has put in place physical, electronic, and organisational procedures to safeguard 
      and secure the information it collects online.  We aim to ensure  your data is always safe. However, security
      standards and protocols are constantly evolving and we make no warranty as to the particular efficacy of 
      the security measures adopted by us. You should consider any communication that you transmit to Transware 
      (such as data, questions, answers, comments or suggestions) as non-confidential, and agree that Transware
      will not be liable or responsible if information that belongs to you is intercepted or used by an unintended
      recipient. </p>

      <h2>Does Transware collect personal information from or about children?</h2>
      <p>Transware uses reasonable efforts not to collect, use or disclose individually identifiable information 
        from children under the age of 18. The Services are not targeted at children, and children may not 
        register for any portions of the Services that require registration.</p>
