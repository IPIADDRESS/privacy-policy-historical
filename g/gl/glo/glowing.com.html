                Through the use of the Services you may encounter information from or links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of other sites. Please review those sites for their own privacy policies.

            <h2>
                What We Collect
            </h2>
            <p>
                INFORMATION YOU GIVE US:<br>
                Glow gives you a number of options regarding what information you will give us:
            </p>
            <p>
                • When you register to create an account with Glow and/or Glow First; 
            </p>
            <p>
                • When you participate on a Forum or other communication mechanism; and
            </p>
            <p>
                • When you update the Glow App or the Website with information relevant to your fertility, 
            </p>
            <p>
                When you register with Glow you will submit a variety of information about yourself (such as gender, age, birthdate, email address, mobile phone number) and may submit a variety of other information (such as menstrual cycle, weight, temperature, occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.).  You may also choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by third parties including social media sites (such as Facebook and Twitter). The information we have access to varies by site and is controlled by your privacy settings on that site and your authorization. You may (and may be required to) share information about or give us access to additional third-party websites or services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, when you sign up for Glow First, we may collect other information such as credit card numbers and/or cell phone numbers, as well as other information about you necessary to ensure that the transaction is properly authorized, such as your address, zip code, and cv number (collectively, “Payment Information”).  We also may retain such information (or our third party “fulfillment house”, such as PayPal, may retain such information) to facilitate future transactions.  See “Controlling Your Personal Information” below if you would like us not to use that information to assist you in completing future transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you choose to participate in Glow First, not only may you need to provide us with Payment Information, but if you become entitled to receive a payment from Glow First, you will need to provide us with your social security number as well as information about an accredited infertility clinic, as well as proof of medical claims showing that you are using their services.  We may use that information in making filings with the IRS or relevant state taxing authorities. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to information about yourself, it may be possible for you to submit other content ("Content"), such as photos and other media, each of which you present through technology available through the Services. It is entirely up to you whether you want to submit this additional information, and whether you would like to make it available to others.  However, Glow has no responsibility for how people you allow to view your Content (or the public if you make any information available to the public) use that material, or to whom they may forward it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, we may use information that you include in emails to us to assist us in providing the Service, and we may publish that information on an anonymous basis.  In addition, the text of any posting on any one of the forums, bulletin boards, or other similar publically accessible systems offered by Glow (including any market place or wish list) becomes the property of Glow, and may be republished by Glow in its sole discretion.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In each case, we will collect and record the information you have provided. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM OTHER SOURCES:
            </h2>
            <p>
                Other than names and email addresses provided at your discretion, or information you give us in connection with Glow First we don't generally require you to give us any “Personally Identifying Information” about yourself, although of course all the information about your health is extremely private.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, when you use the Glow App, we may record information regarding the use of the Glow App, including your cell phone number, and if such facilities are enabled on your cell phone, your location and similar information. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, in order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain internal reports and make recommendations, we collect aggregate information about the use of the Service, including information about users accessing the Website or using the Glow App, such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time (“Activity Information”). 
            </p>
            <p>
                When you visit the Services, we may also store information based on your usage history. This includes, but is not limited to, details of your transactions, content you viewed, click stream information, and cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account. We use various technologies to collect and store information which may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with the services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Glow features that may appear on other sites and in any other manner that we deem necessary for our business purposes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We may also collect information about you from any third parties such as credit bureaus or identity verification services. You may choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by third parties such as social media sites (such as Facebook and Twitter). The information we have access to varies by site and is controlled by your privacy settings on that site and your authorization. You may (and may be required to) share information about or give us access to additional third-party websites or services. Should you do so, you agree that UPW may collect, store and use this information in ways consistent with this Privacy Policy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                By using the Service, you consent to our retaining all the above-described information indefinitely.
