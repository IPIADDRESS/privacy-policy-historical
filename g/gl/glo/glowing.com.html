                    <p>
                        INFORMATION YOU GIVE US:
                        <br>
                        Glow gives you a number of options regarding what information you will give us:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        • When you register to create an account with Glow and/or Glow First (whether through one of the
                        Glow Apps or on the Internet);
                    </p>

                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you register with Glow you will submit a variety of information about yourself (such as gender, age,
                        birthdate, email address, mobile phone number) and as you use the Glow Apps you may submit a variety of
                        information (such as menstrual cycle, weight, temperature, occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.)
                        which may include information about personal health issues and/or information related to your past, present,
                        or future physical or mental health condition. You may also choose to provide us with access to certain
                        personal information stored by third parties including social media sites (such as Facebook and Twitter) and
                        health sites, such as Apple HealthKit and Google Fit. The information we have access to varies by site and is
                        controlled by your privacy settings on that site and your authorization. You may (and may be required to)
                        share information about or give us access to additional third-party websites or services.

                        information) to facilitate future transactions. See “Controlling Your Personal Information” below if you
                        would like us not to use that information to assist you in completing future transactions.

                        Agreement, not only may you need to provide us with Payment Information, but if you become entitled to
                        receive a payment from Glow First, you will need to provide us with your social security number as well as
                        information about an accredited infertility clinic and proof of medical claims showing that you are using their
                        services. We may use that information in making filings with the IRS or relevant state taxing authorities.

                        Services, including but not limited to our forum. It is entirely up to you whether you want to submit this
                        additional information, and whether you would like to make it available to others – although information you

                        may forward it.

                        reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process (for example, we may disclose your
                        information as necessary to comply with an authorized civil, criminal or regulatory investigation), such as a
                        search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to protect our rights and property, or that of our affiliates

                        discretion to be unlawful. If we are legally compelled to disclose information about you to a third party, we
                        will attempt to notify you by sending an email to the email address in our records unless doing so would
                        violate the law or unless you have not provided your email address to us. Except as may be otherwise
                        provided in the Terms of Use or the Glow Fertility Program Patient Services Agreement, Glow may maintain copies

                        to share this information. Due to our contractual obligations with these third parties and the need to share
                        information to deliver and support the Services, however, we cannot provide you with the opportunity to optout
                        of sharing information (whether Personally Identifiable Information or other information) with these third

                        Services and recommendations, reduce risk to all parties involved in our transactions, and verify the accuracy

                        collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize the Services, content, and advertising.

                        system, since any information you have instructed us to share will become subject to those policies (Apple’s
