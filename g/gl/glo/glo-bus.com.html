            GLO-BUS Software, Inc. operates several websites including bsg-online.com and glo-bus.com. It is GLO-BUS Software, Inc.’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any

            Website Visitors
          </h3>
          <p>
            Like most website operators, GLO-BUS Software, Inc. collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available,
            such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. GLO-BUS Software, Inc.’s purpose in collecting
            non-personally identifying information is to better understand how GLO-BUS Software, Inc.’s visitors use its website. From time to time, GLO-BUS Software, Inc. may
            release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
          </p>
          <p>
            GLO-BUS Software, Inc. also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
          </h3>
          <p>
            Certain visitors to GLO-BUS Software, Inc.’s websites choose to interact with GLO-BUS Software, Inc. in ways that require GLO-BUS Software, Inc. to gather
            personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that GLO-BUS Software, Inc. gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we
            ask visitors who sign up for an account at http://www.glo-bus.com/ to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with GLO-BUS Software,
            Inc. – by purchasing access to the <em>GLO-BUS</em> service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and
            financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, GLO-BUS Software, Inc. collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
            appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with GLO-BUS Software, Inc. GLO-BUS Software, Inc. does not disclose personally-identifying information
            other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in
            certain website-related activities.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Aggregated Statistics
          </h3>
          <p>
            GLO-BUS Software, Inc. may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, GLO-BUS Software, Inc. may monitor the IP geolocation of
            logged-in users to help prevent fraudulent access. GLO-BUS Software, Inc. may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, GLO-BUS Software,
            Inc. does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
          </h3>
          <p>
            GLO-BUS Software, Inc. discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated
            organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on GLO-BUS Software, Inc.’s behalf or to provide services available at GLO-BUS Software,
            Inc.’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of
            your home country; by using GLO-BUS Software, Inc.’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. GLO-BUS Software, Inc. will not rent or sell
            potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as
            described above, GLO-BUS Software, Inc. discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order
            or other governmental request, or when GLO-BUS Software, Inc. believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
            GLO-BUS Software, Inc., third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an GLO-BUS Software, Inc. website and have supplied your email address,
            GLO-BUS Software, Inc. may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with
            GLO-BUS Software, Inc. and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our
            feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. GLO-BUS Software,
            Inc. takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information.

            website access preferences. GLO-BUS Software, Inc. visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies
            before using GLO-BUS Software, Inc.’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of GLO-BUS Software, Inc.’s websites may not function properly without the aid

            Business Transfers
          </h3>
          <p>
            If GLO-BUS Software, Inc., or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that GLO-BUS Software, Inc. goes out of business or enters
            bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
            acquirer of GLO-BUS Software, Inc. may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
          </p>
          <h3>
