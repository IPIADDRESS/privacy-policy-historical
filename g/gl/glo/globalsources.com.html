<b>Privacy Policy </b>
<p>
<b>Introduction</b>
</p><p>
Global Sources regularly collects and processes information about advertisers, exhibitors, and visitors who use websites and tradeshows which we operate and control, and for which we may be deemed to act as the Data Controller. Please note that we process your data using servers and storage facilities located in Hong Kong.
</p><p>
The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to give you clear and comprehensive information about the Personal Data that we collect about individuals, and to provide an explanation of how and why we use personal information that may relate to you.
</p><p>
We may make changes to this Policy from time to time in order to keep it up to date and compliant with legal requirements.

Note that we may also notify you about <b>significant</b> changes by email, using the address you last provided or by posting an alert which will be displayed when you access our systems. This Policy is not intended to override the terms of any contract that you have with us or between buyers and suppliers (or any rights you might have available under applicable data protection laws).
</p><p>

		<li><b>Data Portability</b>
			<ul>		
				<li>You can ask us to provide your personal information to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it 'ported' directly to another Data Controller, but in each case only where:
					<ul>	
					<li>The processing is based on your consent or the performance of a contract with you; and</li>	
					<li>The processing is carried out by automated means.</li>	
					</ul>
				</li>
				
			</ul>				
		</li>		
		
		
		<li><b>Information about any automated processing</b> e.g. segmentation or profiling using your data. You can ask not to be subject to such processing.</li>		
		<li><b>The basis for international transfers.</b></li>
		
	</ul>	
<p></p>	

To exercise your rights, you can contact us as set out above. Please note the following if you do wish to exercise these rights:
<p>
</p><p style="padding-left:40px;">
	</p><ul>
		<li><b>Identity</b> - We take the confidentiality of all records containing personal information seriously and reserve the right to ask you for proof of your identity if you make a request.</li>
		<li><b>Fees</b> - We will not ask for a fee to exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal information, unless your request for access to information is unfounded, repetitive or excessive, in which case we will charge a reasonable amount in the circumstances.</li>
		<li><b>Timescales</b> - We aim to respond to any valid requests within one month unless it is particularly complicated or you have made several requests, in which case we aim to respond within three months. We will let you know if we are going to take longer than one month. We might ask you if you can help by telling us what exactly you want to receive or are concerned about. This will help us to action your request more quickly.</li>
		<li><b>Exemptions</b> - Local laws, including in the EU member states, provide for additional exemptions, in particular to the right of access, whereby personal information can be withheld from you in certain circumstances, for example where it is subject to legal privilege.	</li>
	</ul>
<p></p>	
You also have the right to complain to your supervisory authority (see 'Contact Details').
