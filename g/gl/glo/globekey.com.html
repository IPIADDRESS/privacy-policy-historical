      <h2>Privacy Statement </h2>
      <p> Globekey does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals                except when such individuals specifically provide such information on                a voluntary basis. For example, such personally identifiable information                may be gathered from a contest or sweepstakes registration, user enrollment,                affiliate enrollment, hotel enrollment, and Vacation Auction sign-up.                Personally identifiable information on individual users will not be sold                or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties without the approval                of the user at the time of collection. At such points of collection, the                user will have the opportunity to indicate whether he or she would like                to "opt out" of receiving auction notices, promotional and/or marketing                information about other products, services and offerings from Globekey                and/or any third parties. Further, notwithstanding any opt out of promotional                information by the user, Globekey reserves the right to contact a hotel                member, affiliate member, or user regarding account status, changes to                the subscriber agreement and other matters relevant to the underlying                service and/or the information collected.<br>
      </p>
      <p> Globekey reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior                and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various                areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well                as the number of users that have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising                banners. Globekey will provide only aggregated data from these analyses                to third parties. Also, users should be aware that Globekey will not use                users' collected names and information for third party use unless the                user has provided permission for such use. Globekey is not responsible                for any actions or policies of such third parties and users should check                the applicable privacy policy of such party when providing personally                identifiable information. <br>
      </p>
      <p> Additionally, users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose                personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address)                on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas of the Globekey sites, that                information, along with any substantive information disclosed in the user's                communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties                and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties.                Such activities are beyond the control of Globekey .</p>
      <p>Users also should be aware that non-personal information and data may                be automatically collected through the standard operation of Globekey's                Internet servers or through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small                text files a web site can use to recognize repeat users, facilitate the                user's ongoing access to and use of the site and allow a site to track                usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements                and targeted advertising. Cookies are not programs that come onto a user's                system and damage files. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique                number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. Users                should be aware that Globekey cannot control the use of cookies or the                resulting information by affiliates, advertisers or third parties hosting                data for Globekey. If a user does not want information collected through                the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that                allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should                note that cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features                (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on the Globekey Site. </p>
      <p>Upon request, Globekey will allow any user to "opt out" of further promotional                contacts at any time. Additionally upon request, Globekey will use reasonable                efforts to allow users to update/correct personal information previously                submitted which the user states is erroneous to the extent such activities                will not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon a user's                request, Globekey will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally                delete the user and his or her personal information from its database;                however, it may be impossible to delete a user's entry without some residual                information because of backups and records of deletions. </p>
      <p>The foregoing policies are effective as of January 1st, 2001. Globekey                reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying users                of the existence of a new privacy statement. This statement and the policies                outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual                or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party. </p>
