   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This privacy 
    statement is applicable to Globekey Guest Reservations. </font></p>
   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Globekey does 
    not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when 
    such individuals specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis. 
    For example, such personally identifiable information may be gathered from 
    a contest or sweepstakes registration, user enrollment, affiliate enrollment, 
    hotel enrollment, and Vacation Auction sign-up. Personally identifiable information 
    on individual users will not be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated 
    third parties without the approval of the user at the time of collection. 
    At such points of collection, the user will have the opportunity to indicate 
    whether he or she would like to "opt out" of receiving auction notices, promotional 
    and/or marketing information about other products, services and offerings 
    from Globekey and/or any third parties. Further, notwithstanding any opt out 
    of promotional information by the user, Globekey reserves the right to contact 
    a hotel member, affiliate member, or user regarding account status, changes 
    to the subscriber agreement and other matters relevant to the underlying service 
    and/or the information collected. </font></p>
   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Globekey reserves 
    the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics 
    in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and 
    to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that 
    have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners. Globekey will 
    provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties. Also, users 
    should be aware that Globekey will not use users' collected names and information 
    for third party use unless the user has provided permission for such use. 
    Globekey is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties 
    and users should check the applicable privacy policy of such party when providing 
    personally identifiable information. </font></p>
   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, 
    users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable 
    information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the bulletin boards or in 
    the chat areas of the Globekey sites, that information, along with any substantive 
    information disclosed in the user's communication, can be collected and correlated 
    and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other 
    posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Globekey 
    . </font></p>
   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Users also should 
    be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected 
    through the standard operation of Globekey's Internet servers or through the 
    use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files a web site can use to recognize 
    repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of the site 
    and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will 
    allow content improvements and targeted advertising. Cookies are not programs 
    that come onto a user's system and damage files. Generally, cookies work by 
    assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning 
    site. Users should be aware that Globekey cannot control the use of cookies 
    or the resulting information by affiliates, advertisers or third parties hosting 
    data for Globekey. If a user does not want information collected through the 
    use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the 
    user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should note that 
    cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features (e.g., 
    customized delivery of information) available on the Globekey Site. </font></p>
   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Upon request, 
    Globekey will allow any user to "opt out" of further promotional contacts 
    at any time. Additionally upon request, Globekey will use reasonable efforts 
    to allow users to update/correct personal information previously submitted 
    which the user states is erroneous to the extent such activities will not 
    compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon a user's request, Globekey 
    will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally delete the user and 
    his or her personal information from its database; however, it may be impossible 
    to delete a user's entry without some residual information because of backups 
    and records of deletions. </font></p>
   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The foregoing 
    policies are effective as of January 1st, 2001. Globekey reserves the right 
    to change this policy at any time by notifying users of the existence of a 
    new privacy statement. This statement and the policies outlined herein are 
    not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in 
    or on behalf of any party.</font></p>
