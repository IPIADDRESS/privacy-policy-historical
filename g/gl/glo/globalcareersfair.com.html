					<p>TERRA FIRMA ASSOCIATES LIMITED PRIVACY POLICY<br><br>

Terra Firma Associates Limited also trades as Global Careers Fair. "Us", "We" means “Terra Firma Associates” and “The Global Careers Fair” and "Our" shall be interpreted accordingly.<br><br>

SCOPE<br><br>

This Privacy Policy (“the Policy”) covers the use of personal information that Global Careers Fair (“GCF”) collects and displays when you use this website and the Global Careers Platform (“the Platform”).  <br><br>

The Policy does NOT cover the use of any personal information that any other websites linked to the Platform may collect from you.  As these are separate sites, we are NOT responsible for their content, security or information collecting policies or any of their terms and conditions.  You should therefore visit the other site’s terms and conditions, disclaimers and privacy policy and be sure that you agree with them before sharing any data with them.<br><br>

We may update the Policy at any time, with or without advance notice. In the event of changes in the Policy, we will display a notice on the Platform or send you an email. Unless stated otherwise, our current Policy applies to all information that Terra Firma has received from you. Using the Services after a notice of changes has been sent to you or published on the Platform constitutes consent to the changed Policy.<br><br>

The Policy covers:<br><br>

1.	Information collected by GCF.<br>
2.	How GCF use your information.<br>
3.	Your information choices.<br>
4.	Your obligations as a Platform User.<br>
5.	Security.<br>
6.	Cookies.<br>
7.	How to contact us.<br><br>


1.	INFORMATION COLLECTED BY GCF<br><br>

1.1	In providing the Services and allowing use of the Platform, GCF may collect the following information from Users:<br><br>

1.1.1	Personal Information: information that can be used to identify you, or any other individual to whom the information may relate, personally. We do not collect personal information unless you choose to provide it to us.<br><br>

1.1.2	Demographic Information: information that is not unique to you in the sense that it refers to selected population characteristics, such as your ZIP code or postal code, age, preferences, gender, race or ethnicity, occupation, career history, interests and favorites.<br><br>

1.1.3	Behavioural Information: information relating to how you use the Platform, what services you access, and information about your computer hardware and software including your IP address, geolocation, browser and operating system type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is necessary for analysing the use of resources, troubleshooting problems, preventing fraud, and improving our services.<br><br>

1.2	Information you post in public areas of the site or placed in the searchable CV database will be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world, including those in countries that might not have legislation that guarantees adequate protection of personal information as defined by your country of residence. By providing your personal information to the Platform, you acknowledge that you consent to your information being used as described here. While Terra Firma takes measures to safeguard your information from unauthorized access or inappropriate use by third parties, GCF does not control these third parties and we are not responsible for their use of information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of the Platform. Accordingly, you should ensure that you do not post sensitive information to the Platform.<br><br>


2.	HOW GCF USE YOUR INFORMATION<br><br>

2.1	The information you provide to GCF may reveal, or allow others to identify, your nationality, ethnic origin, religion, gender, age, geography, or other aspects of your private life. By providing information to us you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Policy and GCF’s Terms and Conditions that allow GCF to process information about you. Supplying information to GCF, including any information deemed “sensitive” by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw your consent to GCF’s collection and processing of your information at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Policy and Terra Firma’s Terms and Conditions, by changing settings or by closing your account, but please note that your withdrawal of consent will not be retrospective.<br><br>

2.2	GCF takes the privacy of our Users very seriously, and we do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes, other than as described below. Further, we will only share your personally identifiable information with third parties in order to provide the Services or unless compelled by law, or as necessary to enforce our Terms and Conditions or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of GCF, other Users, and the public.<br><br>

2.3	GCF will not disclose information provided by Candidates with other Candidates. Candidate information of a demographic and behavioral nature collected on an aggregated basis may be shared with both Exhibitors and Media Partners. Candidate information will only be shared on an individual basis with Exhibitors.  <br><br>

2.4	At the end of the Career Fair GCF may send emails to Candidates on behalf of specific Exhibitors and Media Partners. The Candidate information used to complete this will be collected on an aggregate basis. All of the Candidate information used to send these emails will remain in the possession of GCF.<br><br>

2.5	We may share your information with third parties who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. We disclose information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals may be located in a country whose data protection legislation is different from your country, and they will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party or use that data for any other purpose. We will remain the data controller and be responsible for any information shared in this way.<br><br>

2.5	We disclose information if legally required to do so, or at our discretion pursuant to a request from a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith – after considering your privacy interests and other factors – that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.<br><br>


3.	YOUR INFORMATION CHOICES<br><br>

3.1	Once the Platform has gone live, you can review the information you provided to us and make any desired changes to the information at any time via the “My Preferences / Settings” link on the Platform. Please be aware that even after your request for a change is processed, GCF may, for a time, retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of its database. GCF is not responsible for informing other Users of the Platform that information has been changed and that copies taken from the Platform may have subsequently been changed.<br><br>

3.2	You cannot remove your information via the Platform. In order to close your Platform account and remove your information you must contact GCF and request your information is deleted. If you close your account, we will delete all of your account information without liability. Notwithstanding this, GCF reserves the right to retain certain information provided for its own reasonable use. GCF disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation not to delete the information. <br><br>


4.	YOUR OBLIGATIONS AS A PLATFORM USER<br><br>

4.1	As a User, you have certain obligations to GCF and to other Users, including but not limited to those imposed by applicable law and regulations and:<br><br>

4.1.1	You must, at all times, abide by the Terms and Conditions of the then-current Privacy Policy and User Agreement. This includes respecting all intellectual property rights that may belong to third parties (such as trademarks or photographs).<br><br>

4.1.2	You must not download or otherwise disseminate any information that may be deemed to be injurious, violent, offensive, racist or xenophobic, or which may otherwise violate the purpose of the Platform and its community of Users.<br><br>

4.1.3	You must not provide to GCF and/or other Users information that you believe might be injurious or detrimental to your person or to your professional or social status.<br><br>

4.1.4	You must keep all account information, including but not limited to your username and password, confidential and not share it with others.<br><br>

	Any violation of these guidelines may lead to the restriction, suspension or termination of your account at the sole discretion of GCF.<br><br>

4.2	Please remember that if you post any of your personal information on the Platform, such as in online forums or User messages, such information may be collected and used by others over whom GCF has no control. We cannot control the use made by third parties of information you post or otherwise make available on the Platform.<br><br>


5.	SECURITY<br><br>

5.1	In order to help secure your personal information, access to your data on the Platform is password-protected, and sensitive data is protected by encryption. However, since the internet is not a secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to the Platform. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<br><br>
