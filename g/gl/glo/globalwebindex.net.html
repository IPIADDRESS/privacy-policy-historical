<p>This policy (together with our terms and conditions for use of our GlobalWebIndex service (including trial service) &nbsp;and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.&nbsp; Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.</p>
<p>For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act), the data controller is Trendstream Limited of 143 London Road, Kingston Upon Thames, Surrey KT2 6NH.</p>
<p>Information we may collect from you</p>
<p>We may collect and process the following data about you:</p>
<ul>

This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our site, subscribing to our service, or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with our site.</li>
<li>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</li>
<li>We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.</li>
<li>Details of your visits to our site (including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise) and the resources that you access.</li>

<p>Where we store your personal data</p>
<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”).

<li>In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.</li>
<li>If Trendstream Limited or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
