			This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices 
			for the Globat.com site and various related services (together 
			referred to as the 'site'). Globat.com, the provider of the site 
			(referred to as 'us' or 'we'), is dedicated to protecting your 
			privacy online. Please read the information below to learn the 
			following regarding your use of this site:</p><p><b><a href="#1">1. What information do

			</b> <br><br>
			</p><p><b><a href="#9">9. What else should you know about your privacy online?</a></b><br><br>
			</p><p>You acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is part of our Site 
			Terms of Use, and by accessing or using our site, you agree to be 
			bound by all of its terms and conditions. If you do not agree to 
			these terms, please do not access or use this site.<br><br>
			</p><p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. 
			Such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be 
			effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by any 
			means including, but not limited to issuing an e-mail to the e-mail 
			address listed when you order a product or service or posting the 
			revised Policy on this page or somewhere else on our website. You 
			acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to maintain a 
			valid e-mail address as a customer or user of our website, review 
			this site and this Policy periodically and to be aware of any 
			modifications. Your continued use of the site after such 
			modifications will constitute your: (a) acknowledgment of the 
			modified Policy; and (b) agreement to abide and be bound by the 
			modified Policy.<br><br>
			</p><p><b>1. What information do we collect from you?<a name="1"></a></b><br><br>
			</p><p>In order to better provide you with our numerous services, we 
			collect two types of information about our users: Personally 
			Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable 
			Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is 
			to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience 
			while using our site.<br><br>
			</p><p>Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information 
			that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in 
			certain activities on this site, such as ordering a product or 
			service, entering a contest or sweepstakes, filling out a survey, or 
			sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information 
			about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is 
			completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you 
			elect to engage in these activities, however, we may ask that you 
			provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, 
			mailing address (including zip code), email address, employer, job 
			title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other 
			personal identifying information. When ordering products or services 
			on the site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. 
			Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to 
			provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do 
			not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular 
			activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.<br><br>
			</p><p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to 
			information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. 
			We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit 
			on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and 
			analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This 
			information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator 
			('URL') that you just came from, which URL you go to next, what 
			browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ('IP') address. An 
			URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the 
			World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or 
			device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol 
			('TCP/IP') network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the 
			Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP 
			address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a 
			number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you 
			are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify 
			your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to 
			communicate on the Internet.<br><br>
			</p><p><b>2. Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?<a name="2"></a></b><br><br>
			</p><p>We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about 
			you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. You provide certain 
			Personally Identifiable Information to us when you: <br><br>
			</p><p>(a) enter sweepstakes or contests sponsored by us or one of our 
			partners; <br><br>
			</p><p>(c) sign up for special offers from selected third parties; <br><br>
			</p><p>(d) send e-mail messages, submit forms or transmit other 
			information by telephone or letter; or <br><br>
			</p><p>(e) submit your credit card or other payment information when 
			ordering and purchasing products and services on our site including 
			but not limited to web hosting services.<br><br>
			</p><p>We may also collect information from you at other points on our 
			site that state that such information is being collected.<br><br>
			</p><p>In addition, we may also collect, or our third party ad server 
			and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally 
			Identifiable Information. This information is ultimately stored in 
			the form of store categories, and, in some cases, specific URLs. We 
			use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, 
			to administer our site and to gather demographic information. Our 
			third party ad servers will also provide us with summary, but not 
			individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were presented 
			and clicked upon at our site.<br><br>
			</p><p>We will primarily use your Personally Identifiable Information to 
			provide our services to you, as required by our agreements with you. 
			We will also use Personally Identifiable Information to enhance the 
			operation of our site, fill orders, improve our marketing and 
			promotional efforts, statistically analyze site use, improve our 
			product and service offerings, and customize our site's content, 
			layout, and services. We may use Personally Identifiable Information 
			to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding 
			administrative notices. We may also use Personally Identifiable 
			Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce 
			our agreements with you, including our Site Terms of Use, Sales 
			Terms and Conditions, and this Private Policy.<br><br>
			</p><p><b>3. With whom do we share your information?<a name="3"></a></b><br><br>
			</p><p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable 
			Information to others. We do provide some of our services through 
			contractual arrangements with affiliates, services providers, 
			partners and other third parties. We and our service partners use 
			your Personally Identifiable Information to operate our sites and to 
			deliver their services. For example, we must release your credit 
			card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for 
			products and services purchased on this site; release your address 
			information to the delivery service to deliver products that you 
			ordered; and provide order information to third parties that help us 
			provide customer service.<br><br>
			</p><p>We will encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy 
			policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable 
			Information by our service partners is governed by the privacy 
			policies of those service partners, and is not subject to our 
			control.<br><br>
			</p><p>Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial 
			authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the 
			appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally 
			Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or 
			to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully 
			cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use 
			our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report 
			to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith 
			believe to be unlawful.<br><br>
			</p><p>We may also provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about 
			our customers' sales, traffic patterns, and related site information 
			to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any 
			Personally Identifiable Information.<br><br>
			</p><p><b>4. How can you update or correct your Personally Identifiable 
			Information? <a name="4"></a></b> <br><br>
			</p><p>We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the 
			Personally Identifiable Information that you have provided to us. 
			You may change any of your Personally Identifiable Information in 
			your account online at any time by linking to your account in 
			accordance with instructions posted elsewhere on this site. You may 
			also access and correct your personal information and privacy 
			preferences by writing us at: <br><br>
			</p><p>Globat LLC <br>
			11684 Ventura Blvd. #825 <br>
			Studio City, CA 91604 <br>
			Email: <a href="mailto:billing@globat.com">Billing@Globat.com</a><br><br>
			</p><p>Please include your name, address, and/or e-mail address when you 
			contact us.<br><br>
			</p><p>We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable 
			Information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on 
			your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of 
			past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with 
			past transactions on this site. In addition, it may be impossible to 
			completely delete your information without some residual information 
			because of backups.<br><br>
			</p><p><b>5. What are your choices regarding collection, use, and 
			distribution of your information?<a name="5"></a></b><br><br>
			</p><p>We may, from time to time, send you e-mail regarding our products 
			and services. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that 
			you are interested in receiving offers or information from us and 
			our partners, we may occasionally send you direct mail about 
			products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only 
			Globat.com (or agents working on behalf of Globat.com and under 
			confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings and 
			only if you indicated that you do not object to these offers. If you 
			do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give 
			us your personal information. Or, at any time you can easily edit 
			your account information to no longer receive such offers and 
			mailings.<br><br>
			</p><p>You also have choices with respect to cookies, as described 
			below. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to 
			accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to 
			reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies some parts 
			of our site may not work properly in your case.<br><br>
			</p><p><b>6. What security precautions are in place to protect against the 
			loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?<a name="6"></a></b><br><br>
			</p><p>At our site you can be assured that your Personally Identifiable 
			Information is secure, consistent with current industry standards. 
			The importance of security for all Personally Identifiable 
			Information associated with our user is of utmost concern to us. 
			Your Personally Identifiable Information is protected in several 
			ways. Access by you to your Personally Identifiable Information is 
			available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. 
			This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge 
			your password to anyone. In addition, your Personally Identifiable 
			Information resides on a secure server that only selected Globat.com 
			personnel and contractors have access to via password. We encrypt 
			your Personally Identifiable Information and thereby prevent 
			unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is 
			transmitted to us.<br><br>
			</p><p>Personal information that you provide that is not Personally 
			Identifiable Information also resides on a secure server and is only 
			accessible via password. Since this information is not accessible 
			from outside Globat.com you will not be asked to select a password 
			in order to view or modify such information.<br><br>
			</p><p>In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions 
			and order fulfillment are handled by established third party 
			banking, processing agents and distribution institutions. They 
			receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit 
			card or other payment information and to process and ship your 
			order.<br><br>
			</p><p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any 
			wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, 
			while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, 
			you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations 
			of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, 
			integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged 
			between you and us through this site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) 
			any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in 
			transit by a third party. <br><br>
			</p><p><b>7. Do we use 'cookies'?<a name="7"></a></b><br><br>
			</p><p>When you use our site we will store cookies on your computer in 
			order to facilitate and customize your use of our site. A cookie is 
			a small data text file, which a Web site stores on your computer's 
			hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved 
			to identify you to us. Our cookies store randomly assigned user 
			identification numbers, the country where you are located, and your 
			first name to welcome you back to our site. The cookies make your 
			use of the site easier, make the site run more smoothly and help us 
			to maintain a secure site. You are always free to decline our 
			cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not 
			work properly in that case.<br><br>
			</p><p>We may use an outside ad serving company to display banner 
			advertisements on our site. As part of their service, they will 
			place a separate cookie on your computer. We will not provide any 
			third-party ad server with any of your Personally Identifiable 
			Information or information about your purchases. We and our third 
			party ad server will collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable 
			Information about you, such as your IP address, browser type, the 
			server your computer is logged onto, the area code and zip code 
			associated with your server and whether you responded to a 
			particular ad. Other advertisers may also place banner ads on our 
			site in the same manner as above, but we will not disclose any 
			Personally Identifiable Information to them.<br><br>
			</p><p><b>8. What should you know about privacy policies and data 
			collection at any third party sites accessible from our site?<a name="8"></a></b><br><br>
			</p><p>Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this 
			document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we 
			collect from you. Other sites accessible through our site have their 
			own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure 
			practices. Please consult each site's privacy policy. We are not 
			responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. 
			Additionally, other companies which place advertising on our site 
			may collect information about you when you view or click on their 
			advertising through the use of cookies. We cannot control this 
			collection of information. You should contact these advertisers 
			directly if you have any questions about their use of the 
			information that they collect.<br><br>
			</p><p><b>9. What else should you know about your privacy online?<a name="9"></a></b><br><br>
			</p><p>You must be at least 18 years old to have our permission to use 
			this site. Our policy is that we do not knowingly collect, use or 
			disclose Personally Identifiable Information about visitors that are 
			under 18 years of age.<br><br>
			</p><p>You should also be aware that when Personally Identifiable 
			Information is voluntarily disclosed (i.e. your name, e-mail 
			address, etc.) in the discussion forums or other public areas on 
			this site, that information, along with any information disclosed in 
			your communication, can be collected and used by third parties and 
			may result in unsolicited messages from third parties. Such 
			activities are beyond our control and this Policy does not apply to 
			such information. Any submissions to chat rooms or other public 
			areas on this site are accepted with the understanding that they are 
			accessible to all third parties. If you do not want your comments to 
			be viewed by third parties, you are advised not to make any 
			submissions. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining 
			the secrecy of your password and/or account information. Please be 
			careful and responsible whenever you're online.<br><br>
			</p><p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the 
			practices of this site, or your dealings with this site, please 
			contact us by sending a letter to:<br><br>
