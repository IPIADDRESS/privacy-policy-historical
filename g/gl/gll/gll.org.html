<p><strong><u>2. Your Personal Data</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;‘Personal data’ is any information that relates to a living, identifiable person. This data can include your name, contact details, and other information we gather as part of our relationship with you.</p>
<p>It can also include ‘special categories’ of data, which is information about a person’s race or ethnic origin, religious, political or other beliefs, physical or mental health, trade union membership, genetic or biometric data, sex life or sexual orientation. The collection and use of these types of data is subject to strict controls. Similarly, information about criminal convictions and offences is also limited in the way it can be processed.</p>
<p>We are committed to protecting your personal data, whether it falls into ‘special categories’ or not, and we only process data if we need to for a specific purpose, as explained below.</p>
<p>We collect your personal data mostly through our contact with you, and the data is usually provided by you, but in some instances we may receive data about you from other people/organisations. We will explain when this might happen in this Notice.</p>
