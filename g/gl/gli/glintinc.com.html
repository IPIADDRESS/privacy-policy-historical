Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies and similar technologies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only Glint’s use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.</p>
<p><strong>“Web Beacons”</strong> (also known as clear gifs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).</p>
<p><strong>“APIs”</strong> or application programming interfaces are software components that enable our Services to communicate with third-party services. We may use APIs to enable our Services to communicate with and gather information from third-party services, such as single sign on (SSO) services, used by our users.</p>
<p>We may receive reports based on the use of Cookies, Web Beacons, APIs, and other similar technologies by third-party services providers that we engage, on an individual and aggregated basis.</p>
<p>We may receive reports based on the use of Cookies, Web Beacons, APIs, and other similar technologies by third-party services providers that we engage, on an individual and aggregated basis.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Log Data.</span> Our servers automatically record certain information about how users use our Services (we refer to this information as <strong>“Log Data”</strong>). Log Data may include information such as a user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a user was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a user browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a user clicked on, comments and other communications conducted over our Services, information from other third party products and services that we enable users to connect to their Accounts and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services, and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our users’ needs and preferences. We may combine the Log Data with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve our Services or to improve marketing, analytics, or functionality. We may use a person’s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-directly-identifying information about how our Services are used. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you or to improve marketing, analytics, or Site functionality.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Location Information.</span> We do not ask for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our App or Services.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Survey Information.</span> If you are Survey Respondent, we will collect your survey responses and provide them to the Glint Client (defined below) (including its Administrators) all under the direction of the Glint Client, who is the data controller in the context of any information you provide in connection with a survey. The <strong>“Glint Client”</strong> is the Glint corporate customer or client which is responsible for administering the survey. Unless we tell you otherwise via the Services before you respond to a particular survey, we will provide your survey response without directly identifying you to the applicable Glint Client; however, please be advised that, it is possible that the Glint Client may be able to determine your identity based on the information you include in your survey responses (by way of example, but not limitation, if you include PII or non-directly-identifying PII from which you may be identified in your comments or other written survey responses).</p>
<p>We will however, in some cases, associate a Survey Respondent’s PII with your survey responses and provide your PII combined with your responses to the applicable Glint Client but we will inform you of this before you respond to the survey. In such cases, if you don’t want your PII associated with your survey responses and provided to the Glint Client, then you should not respond to the survey in question.</p>
<p>The Glint Client may use and disclose your survey responses as they so choose, subject to the terms of their respective agreements with us. We may also disclose survey responses as further described in the Section entitled “Information Shared with Third Parties”.</p>
<h2>ANALYTICS</h2>
<p>We use third-party analytics services, such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Flurry Analytics, to collect and analyze the non-directly identifying personal information described above. These analytics services use the visitor tracking technology we have described above, such as a Cookie, tracking pixel or other mechanism to collect, use, share and store our users’ data.</p>
<p>You can find more details about how Google Analytics collects, uses and stores our users’ data by reviewing the Google privacy policy, located at <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>. In addition, Google Analytics provides you with the ability to opt-out of its tracking services. Details of such opt-out are available at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>. Opting-out of the Google Analytics services will affect only the collection and use of your data by Google Analytics, not by any other party.</p>
<p>Mixpanel’s privacy policy is located at <a href="https://mixpanel.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://mixpanel.com/privacy/</a>. If you wish to opt out of Mixpanel’s automatic retention of data collected through the use of their cookies while you use our Services, you can visit <a href="https://mixpanel.com/optout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://mixpanel.com/optout/</a>.</p>

If you wish to opt out of Flurry’s collection of application usage data while you use our Services, you can visit http://www.flurry.com/legal-privacy/end-user-opt-out.</p>
<p>Our marketing partners, or other analytics service providers, also use Cookies or other similar technologies, to analyze trends, and help us administer the Services, track users’ movements around the Services, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, including to display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Accordingly, Our third party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> [or if located in the European Union click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>]. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.</p>
<p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any PII you submit within the mobile application.</p>
<p>DO NOT TRACK</p>
<p>We may use Cookies to collect PII or track user’s online activities over time and across different web sites. In connection with such activities, we will honor the Do Not Track setting in your browser. Third party service providers we have engaged may use Cookies to collect your PII or online activities over time and across different web sites. For more information regarding Do Not Track mechanisms, see <a href="http://allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://allaboutdnt.com/</a>.</p>
<h2>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES?</h2>
<p>We will not share any PII that we have collected from you, whether you are Survey Respondent or an Administrator, except as described below:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Shared with Our Services Providers.</span> We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services such as a cloud service provider to host Glint’s service and providing technical support. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-PII Shared with Third Parties.</span> We may share aggregated information and non-directly identifying information with third parties, including other users, to enhance the effectiveness of our Services and for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling, benchmarking, and other similar purposes. For example, we may share aggregated, non-directly identifying user or organizational information with other Glint Clients to enable them to compare their organization’s metrics (e.g., survey response rates) with organizations of similar size and/or industry.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Shared with the Glint Client.</span> As described above, in some cases, for Survey Respondents we will associate their PII with their survey responses and provide this PII combined with the responses to the applicable Glint Client but we will inform Survey Respondents of this before they respond to the survey.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Shared with Third Parties Upon the Request of the Glint Client.</span> For Survey Respondents, we will share their survey responses and PII associated with such responses with third parties upon the request of the applicable Glint Client, provided we obtain consent from the Survey Respondents in advance of sharing such information. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions.</span> Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your PII may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information. We may also disclose your personal information to any other third party with your prior consent.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.</span>&nbsp; In certain situations, Glint may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>

<p>Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party’s privacy policy.

<p>Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.</p>
<p>The use of information collected through our Services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Glint Client has engaged Glint Inc.</p>
<p>The EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks were designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the European Commission and Swiss Administration, respectively, to provide companies on both sides of the Atlantic with a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States in support of transatlantic commerce.</p>
<p>Glint participates in and has certified that it complies with the E.U. – U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Glint is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Glint has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List. <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.privacyshield.gov/list</a>.</p>
<p>Glint is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives from the EU and Switzerland, under the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Glint complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions. Glint remains liable in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that we engage to process such personal data on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
<p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Glint is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Glint may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Glint commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy should first contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@glintinc.com">privacy@glintinc.com</a>.

<p>Glint has further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning human resources data transferred from the EU and Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship.</p>
<p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website [<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint</a>], you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p>
<p>If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Framework, the Privacy Shield Framework shall govern.</p>
