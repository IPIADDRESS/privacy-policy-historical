This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains our information collection practices at glixel.com, other websites owned by us and our other interactive properties, including but not limited to our mobile websites and applications (each, a “Glixel Application”) and through offline means. It explains the types of information we collect regarding users of the Glixel Application and how we may use that information so you can make an informed decision about whether to view the content and/or use our services ("Services"). Thus this Privacy Policy applies to information we collect via (1) the Glixel Application (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise); (2) email or electronic newsletters; (3) offline means such as telephone and traditional mail; and (4) any other means or applications in which you connect with us.</p> <p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to Glixel's <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Use</a>. Each time that you access or use Glixel you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Use</a>, and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Use</a> and this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using our Services.</p> <h2 id="info-collected">1. Information That Is Collected</h2> <p>When you provide us with contact or other information in connection with a particular activity, product or service, including your email address or telephone number, you expressly consent to our communicating with you about our products or services using the information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you. This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.</p> <h3>(a) Information You Provide To Us</h3> <p><span class="sub-headline">Personal Information.</span> We may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information, including information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, gender, e-mail address, date of birth, physical address (or elements thereof such as zip code and state). We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Glixel Application, including account registration forms, contact us forms or when you otherwise interact with us.</p> <p><span class="sub-headline">Social Networking Services.</span> You may be given the option to link your account on a third party social networking service. In that case, the authentication of your login credentials are conducted through that third party service provider. When you link your social networking accounts with Glixel Applications or engage with Glixel Applications thorough third party social media platforms, you understand that you may be allowing us ongoing access to certain information stored on those social networking media platforms. In addition, as you interact with the Glixel Applications, you may also be providing information about your activities to the third party social networking services. You should make sure that you are comfortable with the information your third party social networking services may make available to us by visiting those services’ privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy settings directly with those services. We reserve the right to use, transfer, assign, sell, share and provide access to all information that we receive through third party social networking services in the same ways described in this Privacy Policy. You agree that we shall not be liable for the use by social networking services of any information.</p> <p><span class="sub-headline">Job Applications.</span> When applying for select job postings via the Glixel Application, you may elect to send us your resume or other relevant information online. Personal information collected in association with job postings will be used for the purpose of accepting and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings.</p> <h3>(b) Information Collected As You Access and Use the Glixel Application</h3> <p>In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers and advertisers on the Glixel Application may use a variety of technologies (including cookies, flash cookies, web beacons/GIFs, embedded scripts) (“Tracking Technologies”) that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Glixel Application (“Usage Information”). This Usage Information may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to our Glixel Application and all of the areas within our Glixel Application that you visit, among other information. We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer or other device used to access the Glixel Application (any, a “Device”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Glixel Application, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. If you accessed content through an email account, a third party provider may make a “hash” of your email address, which is a bit of text that uniquely identifies the email address but is designed to prevent reverse engineering so that the email address is not revealed (“Hash”).</p> <p>Information gathered from your use of the Glixel Application may be combined with information from third party sources to identify your location by state and region (“Region Location”). More specific information about your geographic location may be collected for certain Glixel Applications ("Geolocation"), as more clearly spelled out in this policy.</p> <p>A few of the Tracking Technologies that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following:</p> <p><span class="sub-headline">Cookies.</span> A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Glixel Application. We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Glixel Application and for other purposes, as described further in this Privacy Policy. Cookies are stored on users’ hard drives. We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Glixel Application and expire when the user closes his/her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Glixel Application easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next. “Flash cookies,” known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit. Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click <a target="_blank" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">here</a>. If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Glixel Application may not function properly.</p> <p><span class="sub-headline">Web Beacons.</span> Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Glixel Application, to monitor how users navigate the Glixel Application, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p> <p><span class="sub-headline">Embedded Scripts.</span> An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Glixel Application, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Glixel Application, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p> <p><span class="sub-headline">HTML5.</span> We use HTML5 in the Glixel mobile website and certain mobile applications for the iphone or ipad (and any other Apple iOS device). HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies. Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser “cookies” file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites. To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.</p> <p id="geolocation"><span class="sub-headline">Geolocation Glixel Applications.</span> For certain of the mobile Glixel Applications, we may, and may enable a third party such as an advertiser to, ask you if you wish us to collect your geolocation in order provide you with information about goods and services within your geographic location. If you agree to have your geolocation collected, we and the third party, if applicable, will maintain information about your geolocation to facilitate your searching or implement other functionality in the Glixel Application, such as to serve targeted advertising. In addition, when you have geolocation software running on your mobile phone, computer or other Device, we may collect that information as controlled by your privacy settings on those Devices.</p> <h3>(c) Information You Provide About a Third Party</h3> <p>If you send someone else a communication from the Glixel Application, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. If that person becomes a subscriber to our newsletter, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other subscribers. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Glixel Application, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p> <h3>(d) Information We Collect from Third Parties</h3> <p>We may acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information that you provided or we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic information and lifestyle information. We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes. We may also acquire information from other sources about your visits over time and across other third party web sites, in order to serve more targeted advertising to you on the Glixel Application.</p> <h2 id="use-and-share-info">2. How We Use and Share the Information Collected</h2> <h3>(a) Provide, Manage and Improve our Services</h3> <p>We use the information that we collect and obtain to provide our goods and services, to administer the Glixel Applications and Services and for other lawful business purposes.</p> <p>We may provide access to information, including personal information, to certain vendors that are performing services on our behalf, including managing our email lists and sending email messages on our behalf, providing customer support and performing other administrative services. These service providers are provided access to this information only for the purpose of carrying out the services on our behalf.</p> <p>We may also use the information that we collect and obtain about you to measure and improve our Services, to customize certain features of the Glixel Application, to deliver relevant content and to provide you with an enhanced experience based on the type of device you are using. We also use the information collected to serve advertising on the Glixel Applications that we believe is most likely to be of interest to you.</p> <h3 id="email-newsletters">(b) Email Newsletters.</h3> <p>We may send you our email newsletter(s). If you wish to unsubscribe from our email newsletter(s), simply follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email newsletter.</p> <h3 id="email-promotions">(c) Email Marketing Offers.</h3> <p>We may send you promotional emails regarding special offers about our products and services or on behalf of third party marketing partners who we think can offer services and products of interest to you. We may also share your name and email address and certain other information, with reputable companies that provide marketing offers through email. If you do not want us to send you emails regarding special promotions or offers or share your Personal Information with other companies so that they can send you email offers, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions that are located at the bottom of those emails. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving promotional e-mails, we may continue to send you electronic service notifications that are related to your account(s) and other products and services you have requested or in which you are currently enrolled.</p> <h3>(d) Reader Surveys.</h3> <p>We may collect Personal Information from you in connection with voluntary surveys about your readership of the Glixel Application, your household/personal characteristics and your purchase behavior. The information you provide in response to optional survey questions will only be shared in the aggregate with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection. You may always elect not to receive any surveys from us by following the unsubscribe instructions located at the bottom of any survey.</p> <h3 id="tracking-tech">(e) Use of Tracking Technologies (e.g., Cookies) by Third Party Service Providers; Advertising</h3> <p>We may work with third parties to provide services on the Glixel Applications. For example, we use analytics services supported by third party companies to perform analytics and track trends. We work with other third parties to provide certain functionalities on the Glixel Applications and to improve the effectiveness of the Glixel Application and its content. Those third party companies may use Tracking Technologies to collect and store information about you and your usage of the Glixel Applications and may combine this information with information they collect from other sources.</p> <p>If you access the Glixel Applications through a mobile device or app, we may also share your information with mobile carriers, operating systems and platforms.</p> <p>We may use Tracking Technologies to collect information about your usage of the Glixel Applications to deliver ads that are relevant to you. We may use information about your visits over time and across the Glixel Application and other third party web sites, as well as information received from other sources, in order to serve more targeted advertising to you on the Glixel Applications.</p> <p>To provide ads on the Glixel Applications, we use a variety of third party advertising service providers, including networks, data exchanges, ad servers, analytics providers and others. These third parties may use technology to send, directly to your Device, the advertisements and links that appear on the Glixel Application. They automatically receive your Device Identifier when this happens. Their tools may also limit the number of times you see the same ad on a Glixel Application and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.

Google is one of the companies that we use to serve advertising and perform analytics on some of the Glixel Applications. We and third party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to help implement the above uses of your information. We also use Google Analytics along with audience data (such as age, gender and interests of users) to help understand users’ visits to the Glixel Applications and to optimize the content that we serve to users.</p> <p>To learn about Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs for the Web, <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">click here</a>.
