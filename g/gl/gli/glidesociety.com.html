                    We collect information that you voluntarily provide to become a registered User 
                    of our Jumptuit Service, and when you use certain aspects of our Jumptuit 
                    Service (e.g., entering an email address to send an email from your Jumptuit 
                    account).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We collect information when you register to join Jumptuit by logging into an 
                    account that you already have with certain third-party web services ("TPWS") 
                    (including, but not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, Linkedin, Google+ 
                    and Windows Live) via our Jumptuit Service. For example, our Jumptuit Service 
                    allows you to create an account and login to the Jumptuit Service using your 
                    Facebook account credentials through Facebook Connect. If you are not 
                    currently registered as a User on the Jumptuit Service and you click on "Sign 
                    in Using Facebook," you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials 
                    and then be given the option to register and join Jumptuit.

                <p>
                    <em>Personal Information.</em> When you register with us through the Jumptuit Service 
                    to become a registered user of Jumptuit, we will ask you for certain information

                    photo, free-form biography, location/hometown, website and email address. If 
                    you decide to create your user account by logging into a TPWS via the Jumptuit 
                    Service, you are using the Personal Information you have already provided to the 
                    TPWS (such as your "real" name, email address and other information you make 
                    publicly available via the TPWS) to create your user account on our Jumptuit 
                    Service; the information we collect may depend on the privacy settings you 
                    have with the TPWS, so please consult the TPWS's privacy and data practices. 
                    For example, by using Facebook Connect, you are allowing us to access the 
                    Personal Information in your Facebook account pursuant to the Facebook Terms 
                    of Use regarding your use of the Jumptuit Service via Facebook. We use your 
                    Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your "Non-Identifying 
                    Information," see below) to provide the Jumptuit Service to you. For example: 
                    Account registration. We create your user account for your use of the Jumptuit 
                    Service based upon the Personal Information you provide.

                    newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that 
                    may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to 
                    receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions 
                    provided in any of the communications.

                    your personal contacts (including email addresses of friend lists via TPWS) to the 
                    Jumptuit Service so that you can find your friends on the Jumptuit Service, and 
                    your friends can find you on the Jumptuit Service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Emailing via a Jumptuit Account.</em> As part of the Jumptuit Service, users may 
                    communicate with other registered and non-registered users through use of their 
                    Jumptuit accounts. Where users have selected the option of adding one or more 
                    email addresses to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding 
                    template will be sent from Jumptuit to those email addresses on their behalf.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Non-Identifying Information.</em> We also collect other information that you provide 
                    as part of registration and the operation and personalization of your boards 
                    on Jumptuit that cannot reasonably be used to identify or contact you (e.g., 
                    without limitation, age and individual preferences) ("Non-Identifying Information"). 
                    Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal 
                    Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your 
                    zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be personally 
                    identified or contacted. But the same pieces of information are considered 
                    Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with 
                    other Non-Identifying Information (for example, your viewing preferences) We 
                    may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and 
                    aggregate it with information collected from other Jumptuit users to attempt to 
                    provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the 
                    Jumptuit Service and to analyze and understand how our Jumptuit Service 
                    is used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to 
                    serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your 
                    preferences or restrictions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Mobile Software.</em> Our mobile software allows Jumptuit users to access and use 
                    the Jumptuit Service from their mobile devices. Through the use of the mobile 
                    software, you also have the option to identify the location of user content that you 
                    wish to upload to your Jumptuit account. Under certain circumstances (e.g. any 
                    malfunction of the mobile software), we will also receive information about your 
                    mobile device model, software version and device carrier, which would, allows us 
                    to identify and fix problems and otherwise improve the performance of our mobile 
                    software.

                    <em>Log Data.</em> When you visit the Jumptuit Service, whether as a registered User or 
                    a non-registered User just browsing, our servers automatically record information 
                    that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log 
                    Data may include information such as the browser type or the webpage you were 
                    visiting before you came to our Jumptuit Service, pages of our Jumptuit Service 
                    that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our 
                    Jumptuit Service, access times and dates, and other statistics. We may use 
                    this information to monitor and analyze usage trends by users of the Jumptuit 
                    Service, for the technical administration of the Jumptuit Service, to assess and

                    tailor our Jumptuit Service to the needs of our users. For example, some of this 
                    information is collected so that when you visit the Jumptuit Service again, it will 
                    recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements 
                    and other information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information 
                    to verify that visitors to the Jumptuit Service meet the criteria required to process 
                    their requests.

                    <em>Cookies.</em> Like many online services, the Jumptuit Service uses "cookies" to 
                    collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer 
                    or mobile device’s hard disk. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we 
                    utilize "persistent" cookies to save your login information for future logins to

                    features of the Jumptuit Service, to better understand how you interact with the 
                    Jumptuit Service and to monitor aggregate usage by users of and web traffic 
                    routing on the Jumptuit Service. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are 
                    deleted from your computer when you log off from the Jumptuit Service and then 
                    close your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, 
                    to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the 
                    websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able 
                    to use all functionality of the Jumptuit Service. (See "Your choices regarding

                    Personal Information to create a profile or visual collection, other Jumptuit users 
                    will see your name. If you choose to provide additional Personal Information in

                <p>
                    <em>Information Security.</em> We care about the security of your information. We use 
                    commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of 
                    information collected and maintained through the Jumptuit Service. However, 
                    we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us 
                    or guarantee that information on the Jumptuit Service may not be accessed, 
                    disclosed, altered, or destroyed by unauthorized persons.

                <p>
                    <em>Phishing.</em> Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great 
                    concern to us. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is 
                    a top priority. We do not request your credit card information, login information, or 
                    national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone 
                    communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade 
                    Commission's&nbsp;website.

                <p>
                    <em>Breach Notification.</em> We will use commercially reasonable efforts to make any 
                    legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or 
                    integrity of stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on 
                    security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on the 
                    Jumptuit Service without unreasonable delay, taking into account, among 
                    other things, (a) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (b) any measures 
                    necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable 
                    integrity of the data system.
                </p>
                <p>

                    on - computers or servers located outside of your state, province, country or 
                    other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective 
                    as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and 
                    choose to provide information to us, your Personal Information will be transferred 
                    to the United States and processed there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy

                    aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will
