To assist in the ease-of-reading we have summarized our privacy statement into separate easy to understand sections.  If you have any questions please contact us using the information provided above.</p><p>

<u>Our Anti-Spam Policy</u></p><p>

We do not allow spamming from our site, with no exceptions.</p><p>

We go far, far beyond the standard practice of performing a background check on all new accounts.  We evaluate their current opt-in or verified-opt-in practices, then, we investigate their past complaint rate, policies on dealing with complaints (if any), and then we TEST their practices by subscribing to their mailing list and validating their stated procedures.  But we don't just stop there.  We then open the account but place it on a "watch list" which means when they launch a mailing it must be visually reviewed by a staff member here to ensure it's not a "spammer in disguise" (many try, all have failed) trying to get through our security.   If the content appears to be a normal mail piece and the list does not have dictionary-spam-looking addresses and other well-known spam bait addresses, we approve the job.  This is done for the first month of mailings or until we feel the account is "safe" to release on their own.  But that's not all we do to ensure we have quality clients on our service....
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>We only work with clients who contact us and operate from their own domains and not from a free or throwaway address,</li>
<li>We only work with clients who are willing to sign our very strict anti-spam policy and procedure statement,</li>
<li>We only work wtih clients who can prove to us where their list came from and how the addresses came onto their list,</li>
<li>We only work with clients who can pass our <a href="http://www.globalintellisystems.com/ethics.html">Ethics Test for E-Mail Marketers</a> the FIRST time it is taken (this weeds out most spammers instantly.)</li>
<li>We only work wtih clients who are listed on <a href="http://www.dnb.com">Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corporation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
This weeds out 99.999% of most spammers instantly, leaving us with quality, reputable clients who do no harm to the Internet community.</p><p>

Note: With any mailing list of any size, there will always be complaints because people simply forget they subscribed.  In addition, sometimes clients with older lists (some dating back to 1995) have addresses which came onto the list prior to the list becoming verified-opt-in and have never bounced but converted to decoy addresses. We help our clients cure this within the first week on our service.  In any event, if you are a recipient of a questionable message or are an ISP/online service administrator who has a suspicious message sent from our network, simply <a href="mailto:support@gliq.com">contact us</a> and we will jump on the case immediately.
</p><p> 
 
<u>For Recipients - How Your E-Mail Address Is Located</u></p><p>

Our customers (100% of them) maintain strict opt-in and double-opt-in policies on their own websites.  You only receive mail from our clients if you subscribe to their lists.  You will receive a confirmation e-mail within minutes of subscribing and most of the time you will be required to click on a link inside that confirmation to verify you want to subscribe.  This is known as "double opt-in" or "verified opt-in" and we encourage ALL of our clients to use this form of opt-in.
</p><p>
We do not, ever, allow customers to harvest, collect, purchase, rent, or acquire e-mail address lists, period.  We maintain one of the strictest no-spam policies on the Internet.  Customers are trained, often by us, on the proper methods to use when setting up their mailing list.  Often times when you subscribe to a client list you will receive mailings from that client the same day and sometimes a few times per week.  This is standard practice for many clients but you have total control over what you receive, when, and how much you receive.  Our clients will always give you the option to adjust the frequency of mailing.
</p><p>
When you unsubscribe from the client list your address is IMMEDIATELY removed and stored in a "suppression list" which is a method used by most professional mailers to ensure you never receive mail from the client again. 
</p><p>
If you ever have difficulties with one of our clients, we ask that you send us a copy of the content you received and we will perform an audit of your e-mail address on their list to verify, for you, that your list was obtained only by your subscribing to the list.  You will be removed from the list instantly, by us, if we are asked to do so.
</p><p>
<u>Use of Your E-Mail Address</u></p><p>

We do not collect or store your e-mail address from your visit to our website. You are not required to give us your e-mail address when you contact us and if you contact us by e-mail, you may ask for us to destroy your e-mail message after we read it. Your e-mail address may be on a list owned by one of our clients but that client, and only that client, has your address.  We do not share databases between clients so if you are on a mailing list, it is not our list, it is sole and exclusive property of our client.  Any time you give us an e-mail address for problem resolution it is used in that regard only and is destroyed after the problem has been resolved.  We will, however, keep your e-mail address on file if you request us to do so for future contact.
</p><p>

<u>Use of Your Name</u></p><p>

We do not require you give us your name when contacting us nor do we harvest your name or obtain your name by any reverse-IP-matching services on the Internet.  We also do not give your name to anyone other than our support department for problem resolution, should you give us your name.  Should one of our clients have your name in their database, that database is solely owned by our client and we do not share, sell, rent, or distribute any data from that database, ever.  

</p><p>

<u>Use of Your Mailing Address</u></p><p>

We do not require you give us address when contacting us nor do we obtain your address by use of a reverse append e-mail-to-street service.  Should you give us your mailing address it will be used only in the context that you request it be used.  We will not give your mailing address out to anyone, ever, for any reason (other than law enforcement purposes, should it be requested.)  Our client may have your mailing address in their database but that database is sole and exclusive property of our client and we do not share, sell, rent, transfer, or otherwise distribute your mailing address from that database or any database belonging to any client.
</p><p>

<u>Use of Your Telephone Number</u></p><p>

We do not require you give us your telephone number when contacting us.

</p><p>
<u>For Our Customers - How We Handle Your Data</u>
</p><p>
Our system stores e-mail address lists and/or data in unique accounts and databases which are not shared by other account holders.  Your data is isolated from every other client on our service and at no time can a client pull reports or view your information by a process of altering account names/numbers or attempting to fool the system into exposing your data.  When you delete your address list, it is deleted forever and the only way we can recover the data is to go to our tape backup library and recover the data.  Even this tape backup will be forever deleted after 7 business days.  In other words, the data that belongs to you is shared with no other account holders on this service, period.  Proprietary data that is passed from your browser to our system, that our system has sent to you in a cookie or session-state data packet is <u>triple encrypted</u> with different encryption methods.  This means your account name/number is even encrypted in the stream sent to our system for processing.
</p><p>
<u>Data Handling Procedures</u></p><p>

When you perform an e-mailing, the address list and accompanying data is delivered to a transport server where the job is split into 15 parts for final delivery.  Once the job has finished queueing, that job file is also deleted and there are <u>no</u> backups of that job file.  Should a job fail during queueing, for safety you must re-queue the entire job as we do not cross-mix any of our customer data job files.   We chose this approach to help ensure your data remains private all the way to the point the message leaves our facility for the destination mailbox.
</p><p>
Transfer of data to/from our service may be done in 3 different ways.  First, using standard non-encrypted (http://) sessions between your browser and our web server.  This is the standard way most clients transfer their data to us.  This is not secure, meaning that if someone were to "tap" the connection between your office and ours, your data may be comprimised.  The chances of this are remote, but in these days of eavesdropping, wiretaps, and privacy invasion, you never know who is "listening" to a communication whether it is voice or data.   The second and more secure method of transfer is to use a "SSL" connection (https://) which is significantly more secure and requires extremely sophisticated decryption equipment, time, and manpower to decrypt the data stream between your computer and ours.  The chances of someone being able to eavesdrop (tap) the connection between our two business may be a possibility but the chances of the eavesdropper being able to actually decrypt an SSL session between our two businesses is extremely remote.  If you are concerned about your data being comprimised between our two firms during file transfers, be sure to use an HTTPS:// in front of the web address of our server.  This will initiate a secure session between us.   The third type of transfer is called "secure copy" and this is similiar to an SSL session but uses a different data port and different process to retrieve data from you.  An SCP connection is used by some clients who need for us to "pick up" data at pre-determined times every day and upload the data int otheir account.  The version of SCP we use employs "DES" encryption which is very, very, very difficult to decipher.   So if you need for us to pick-up your data in a batch mode, we will use SCP (secure) instead of FTP (totally unsecure.)
</p><p>
If you have concerns or questions about the way we handle your data, please contact us at support@globalintellisystems.com and ask as many questions as you feel necessary to achieve the level of confidence that we do know how to keep your data safe.  As with most firms, we must conclude this page by saying that only <u>you</u> can prevent data theft by keeping the data on your person 24x7 and never letting it out of your sight.  Other than that, anything in this world is possible, even though it is extremely remote, so please understand that we cannot warrant or "guarantee" that your data will never be comprimised during a transfer between our two firms.  The level of intelligence needed to decipher a 1024 bit DES encrypted data packet requires super-computers at a minimum along with a level of intellect that is hard to find.  If you are concerned about your data even after reading this page, we recommend you seek advise from a data security professional to seek the level of comfort you need to use a service such as ours to distribute your e-mail.
