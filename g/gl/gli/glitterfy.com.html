  review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for traffic audits. 
</p>
<p>Under no circumstances will we give specific, identifiable information about 
  our users to outside third parties. However, we will, from time to time, provide 
  advertisers or potential advertisers with aggregated, anonymous information 
  about our users. In addition, any personally identifiable information provided

  further messages. </p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve our ads on the Internet. 
  These third-party advertising companies employ cookie and 1x1 pixel .gif technology 
  to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients. To do so, 
  these companies may use anonymous information about your visits to our Web site 
  and other Web sites. This information can include: date/time of banner ad shown, 
  the banner ad that was shown, their cookie, the IP address. This information 
  can also be used for online preference marketing purposes. </p>

  cookies on your computer, currently you may either visit each ad network's web 
  site individually and opt out or visit the NAI gateway opt-out site to opt-out

  others and may result in the receipt of unsolicited messages. </p>

<p>Finally you should be aware that if your child voluntarily discloses his or 
  her name, e-mail address, etc. within various public forums (including bulletin 
  boards and chat rooms), such disclosures may result in unsolicited messages
