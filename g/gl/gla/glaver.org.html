<h2>glaver.org Privacy Policy</h2>
The websites www.glaver.org, www.atomacrossamerica.org, as well as other domains
registered by us (the "websites") are personal websites of Terence M. Kennedy.
We are totally committed to protecting your privacy. This is a summary of the
various ways we treat the information you provide us while visiting our 
websites.
<p>
It has been our policy, since the sites went online in 1995, to never sell, 
rent, or share personally identifying information about our visitors.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>We do not collect personally identifying information, except with your 
specific knowledge and consent.</li>
<li>We never sell or offer contact information about our visitors to others. 
There's no need to send us an "opt out" message to prevent your name from 
appearing on a million mailing lists.</li>
</ul>
<p> 
In some cases, such as if you e-mail a question or a comment to us, we may 
request your name, e-mail address or other information so that we can, for 
example, e-mail you with a personal reply. If you choose to supply this 
information, we will use it only for the specific purpose for which you supply 
it. 
</p><p>
We never share any of your personally identifying data with any other party 
without your explicit permission, nor use it for commercial purposes. Should we
receive a valid subpoena or similar legal demand, we will comply to the extent
required by law (so far, this has never happened).
</p><p>
About "cookies" - some websites use cookies which contain information such as 
registration information, or similar data, which is stored on your system 
and sent back to a site when you revisit it. We do not, as a rule, use cookies.
Certain sections of our websites require cookies for operation. For example, 
the webmail interface uses cookies to maintain context for your login session.
Such cookies are not placed by, or sent to, any third parties. The Help portion
of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from 
accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a 
new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
</p><p>
Some links on our sites point to other websites not operated by us. When you 
click on such a link, you are leaving our site (which will be shown in the 
address bar of your web browser). External sites may have their own privacy 
policies which may differ from ours.
</p><p>
We never request a credit card number or any other financial information about
you.
</p><p>
<!-- If you subscribe to any mailing lists hosted by this site, you will be asked to
confirm your subscription (to prevent others from subscribing you without your 
permission). At any time, you may unsubscribe from these mailing lists. See the 
<a href="http://listserv.glaver.org/archives">mailing list archive</a> page for
more information.
<p> -->
You have the option of browsing most of our websites with Secure Sockets Layer 
(SSL), which encrypts the data transmissions between your browser and this 
server.
</p><p>
We do not restrict access based on your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your 
geographic location, or your use of anonymizing (VPN) servers to connect to us.
</p><p>
Finally, while your individual information is protected as outlined above, we 
do analyze our web logs to see how we're doing. However, we only use 
aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group. For instance, we like to
see what search words people use to find our websites. Examples of the 
information we collect and analyze include the IP address used to connect to 
us, computer and connection information such as browser type and version, 
operating system, and platform. Many web browsers support (either natively or 
via plugins) changing the data that is reported to us - we only log what your 
browser tells us. If you configure your browser to report that it is a 
PalmPilot running CP/M on a Cray-1, that's fine.
</p><p>
Our privacy policy may be modified from time to time; the last update was on 
November 19th, 2015 to correct spelling and clarify some sections. The last 
actual policy change was when this page was originally posted on September 
28th, 2005.
</p><p>
<!-- Our websites are rated by <a href="http://profile.trustwatch.com/twprofile/profile?dns=www.glaver.org&amp;url=www.glaver.org%2F&amp;v=1">
TrustWatch</a>. You can verify that you are reaching the real website by
clicking on the GeoTrust image at the bottom left of most pages on our websites.
<P> -->
If you ever have any concerns or questions about our privacy policy, please 
contact us. We welcome your feedback. Contact information is displayed in the
footer of most web pages on our websites, including this one.
