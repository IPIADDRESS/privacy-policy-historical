            <p>
                We collect information in three ways: when <u>you</u> provide information to us,
                when information is collected <u>automatically</u>, or when information is <u>shared</u>
                with us by a third party.

            </ul>
            <p>
                We do not collect personal information through the use of automated technology such
                as "cookies" or "beacons" (<a href="#section5">more on cookies, beacons, and how to
                    stop automated collection later in this Privacy Notice</a>).
            </p>

                We collect personal information such as name, date-of-birth, mailing address, and
                email address when you provide it through registration to receive emails, request
                information, submit comments or participate in a promotion (e.g., contest or sweepstakes)
                or survey. For example, if you are on the website of a TV network, viewing SC Johnson
                content such as a product promotion, and you <u>opt-in</u> to receive information
                from SC Johnson, the TV network website will submit to us the information you provided
                so we may contact you as requested.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a SC Johnson website offers shopping or other commercial services, you will use
                an order-form to request information, products and services. The order-form may
                ask you to provide financial information like account or credit card numbers. This
                information is transmitted to us through a secured browsing session. Do not send

                shared with other companies. For example, if you are on the website of a TV network
                viewing content from a TV show, you may have an opportunity to sign-up to receive
                periodic communication/news about the TV show. While you are registering, the TV
                network also may ask you if you would like to have your information shared with
                the TV network's partners. If you decide to do so and SC Johnson is one of the TV
                network partners then we may receive some of your information.

            <p>
                SC Johnson uses automated technology only to collect general non-personal information.
                Automated collection of information occurs mainly through the use of two technologies:
                cookies and web beacons.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>More on "Cookies"</strong> </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong><u>What is a cookie</u></strong> -- A cookie is a small file that a website
                you are visiting places in your computer through your internet browser. Cookies
                have the ability to identify your computer and store information like web pages
                visited, advertisements viewed, frequency, and type of browser used.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cookies are usually managed through your internet browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the website you are visiting provides free content (e.g., espn.com) then it is
                likely that you will also see advertisements of other websites/companies. If so,
                the website you are visiting and the companies that sponsor the advertisements may
                place their own cookies in your computer. Displaying on-line advertisements in unrelated
                websites is primarily accomplished through a practice called "Third Party Ad Serving"
                (<a href="#section6">more on on-line advertising in unrelated websites (Third Party
                    Ad Serving or targeted advertising) and how to stop its delivery later in this Privacy

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><u>How are cookies used</u></strong> -- Cookies are normally used to help
                with security (e.g., time you out of a secured browsing session after a certain
                period of inactivity), site navigation (e.g., remember your preferences so that
                you don't need to reenter information like language preference), and improve your
                browsing experience (e.g., deliver content, advertisements, or offers that are consistent
                with your browsing habits).
            </p>
            <p>
                Cookies can remain in your computer for the duration of a browsing session or for
                a predetermined period of time. Cookies that remain in your computer for the duration
                of a browsing session are called "session" cookies (e.g., the contents of an online
                "shopping basket" will disappear at the end of your browsing session). Cookies that
                remain in your computer for a predetermined period of time are called "persistent"
                cookies (e.g., selecting English in a website that offers content in multiple languages
                so that the content is displayed in English when you return to the website even
                weeks or months later).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><u>How to delete cookies</u></strong> -- Please be aware that deleting cookies
                will likely have a negative effect on the performance of the websites you visit
                and, consequently, you may not be able to see content or use applications offered
                through the websites.

                To delete cookies that have been installed in your computer, please refer to your
                browser's help menu. Normally, you will need to take the following actions:

                <strong><u>What is a web beacon</u></strong> -- Web beacons are small pieces of
                computer code placed in transparent graphic images displayed in websites you may
                be viewing or emails you may receive. Web beacons are not noticeable since they
                are usually placed within a very small portion of an image being observed. Web beacons
                are also known as pixel tags, clear GIFs, and web bugs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><u>How are web beacons used</u></strong> -- Web beacons are normally used
                to monitor website traffic. Web beacons can also be used with cookies to gain an
                understanding of how website users navigate and process the content contained in
                websites. For example, a company owning a network of websites may use web beacons
                to count and recognize users travelling through its multiple websites. Being able
                to recognize users allows the website owner to personalize users' visits and make
                them more user-friendly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><u>How to delete web beacons</u></strong> -- To delete web beacons, you
                will need to delete cookies from your browser (see the section above on "how to
                delete cookies").

                    <strong>More on online advertising in unrelated websites (Third Party Ad Serving or
                        targeted advertising) and how to stop its delivery</strong>

            </div>
            <p>
                <strong><u>What is third party ad serving/targeted advertising</u></strong> -- Third
                party ad serving is the most common practice of delivering advertisements in the
                websites of unrelated companies. For example, when you visit the website of a sports'
                network such as espn.com, you may see advertisements from unrelated sporting equipment
                companies.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><u>How does third party ad serving/targeted advertising work</u></strong>
                -- Third party ad serving utilizes technology such as cookies and web beacons to
                assemble usage information from websites you've visited. This information is utilized
                to guess your potential interests and match them with potential suppliers of related
                product and services. If one of these potential suppliers has contracted with a
                website that you are visiting to deliver its corresponding advertisement, your internet
                browser will assemble appropriate ad information and deliver it to you while you
                are browsing on the unrelated website.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><u>How to limit Third Party Ad Serving</u></strong> -- If you prefer to
                limit or not receive third party advertising, look for an "AdChoices" icon in or
                near to the advertising you are viewing. By selecting this icon, you should be redirected
                to a website that should allow you to limit or stop the delivery of advertisements
                to your computer. However, you should know that the "AdChoices" icon can only help
                you limit advertisements from companies that have signed-up to use the "AdChoices"
                icon to manage Third Party Ad Serving.
            </p>
            <p>
                To the extent an advertisement does not include the AdChoices icon, you should visit
                the website where you are receiving the third party ad (espn.com in the example
                above) or the actual advertiser's website to view its privacy policy and learn how
                to stop receiving third-party advertisements.
