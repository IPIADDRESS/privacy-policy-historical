        <p><strong>Prospectuses</strong><br>
          The Undergraduate and Postgraduate Prospectuses are intended to help

          not replace the University Calendar as a statement of the University 
          regulations. All students will be required as a condition of enrolment 
          to abide by, and to submit to the procedures of, the University's rules 
          and regulations, as amended from time to time. A copy of the current

          course, it will use reasonable endeavours to provide a suitable alternative 
          course. In the event of industrial action or other circumstances beyond
