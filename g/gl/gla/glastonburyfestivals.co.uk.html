<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">what information the Festival may collect about you;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how the Festival will use information we collect about you;</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Festival is committed to safeguarding your personal information. Whenever you provide such information, we are legally obliged to use your information in line with all applicable laws concerning the protection of personal information (including the Data Protection Act 1998, the General Data Protection Regulation, the Data Protection Bill – these laws are referred to collectively in this Privacy Policy as the “data protection laws”). No website can be completely secure; if you have any concerns that your data, please get in touch straight away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have implemented generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to protect personal data from loss, misuse, or unauthorised alteration or destruction. &nbsp;We will notify you promptly in the event of any breach of your personal data which might expose you to serious risk.</span></p>
<h2><b>DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do from time to time ask people for their personal details in forms to subscribe for specific information or entering applications electronically. Personal information collected via this website and the registration process is controlled by Glastonbury Festivals Limited (the data controller). This data is only held for the specified purpose made clear at the time of collection. Your data will only ever be shared with a third party for explicit, necessary processing purposes; for instance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">See Tickets is the Data Processor of your registered personal information. See Tickets have access to your registered personal information for the sole purpose of maintaining your registration details and processing ticket bookings and ticket related enquiries. See Tickets will not use this information to contact you about anything other than the Festival (however you may still receive communication from them if you have made other third party purchases with them independently).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you book accommodation or purchase a water bottle via See Tickets, your booking information will be shared with the accommodation provider or WaterAid respectively, for the sole purpose of processing your booking. Neither our accommodation providers nor WaterAid will use this information to contact you about anything other than your booking (however you may still receive communication from them if you have made other bookings with them or opted in to their mailing lists independently).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">From May 2018, the Festival mailing list (previously administered on the Vice-Versa CRM System) will be processed by SeeTickets’ mail system on the Festival’s behalf. See Tickets will act as the Data Processor on behalf of the Festival. The Festival reserves the right to appoint a new Data Processor for the mailing list. Whilst the Festival newsletter data is stored and processed by See Tickets, it is entirely separate to SeeTickets’ own mailing list, and neither they nor any other third parties will be given access to use your data for any other purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Data Processors will act only on instructions from the Festival.</span></p>
<p>Please note that sometimes we will require you to provide additional personal information, and sometimes sensitive personal information. When we do this we will provide further details about why we are collecting your information and how we will use it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We comply with all relevant data protection laws in all our dealings with your personal data, and we will ensure that our Data Processors do the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Festival will use your personal information for a number of purposes including the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To contact you with information about your ticket registration, ticket or accommodation purchase (either directly or via its data processors e.g. See Tickets or Vice Versa) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To contact you about a submission you have made, including any content you provide for the website, or CVs or applications uploaded to our contact form. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To deal with your requests and enquiries;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To use IP addresses and device identifiers to identify the location of users, to block disruptive use, to establish the number of visits from different countries, and to determine whether you are accessing the services from the UK or not. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For analysis and research purposes so that we may improve the services offered by the Festival. This can include using geo-demographic information from external sources, to ensure that localised services (such as the local ticket area) are protected. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To notify you of any changes to the Festival’s policies and practices.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also use and disclose anonymised information in aggregate (so that no individuals are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where the Festival proposes using your personal information for any other uses we will ensure that we notify you first. When we do this we will provide further information about why we are using your information and how we will use it, and obtain your consent in advance where needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration is open to anyone aged 13 or over, however if you are aged 15 or under, you will need your parent/guardian’s permission before you provide any personal information to the Festival. </span></p>
<h2><b>DATA RETENTION </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an annual event, we recognise that just because you have not used your registration details to purchase a ticket in one year, does not mean you have no intention of using your registration to purchase a ticket in future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you no longer wish to be registered to apply for tickets for the Festival you may delete your registration at any time (as long as you do not have a current booking). </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can subscribe to the official Festival Newsletter either directly via the subscribe link on the Festival website, or via opting in on your Festival registration. </span></p>
