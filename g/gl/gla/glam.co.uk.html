      Privacy and Security Policy</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Effective September 12, 2007
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Your Privacy and the Security of Your Personal Information Is Very Important to Us</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Glam Media, Inc. doing business at www.glam.com ("Glam") values our customers and guests and respects your concerns about online security and privacy. We believe in providing you with a safe and secure experience in fashion, style, and shopping. Our Privacy and Security Policy is intended to protect your privacy and ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information. In addition to reviewing our Privacy and Security Policy, you should also read our Terms of Use. Your use of Glam.com constitutes your agreement to its terms and conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Privacy and Security Policy Will Change Over Time</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Because we continue to develop Glam.com and take advantage of technologies to improve the services we provide, our policies will change over time. We encourage you to refer to this Privacy and Security Policy from time to time to stay abreast of our most current privacy policy practices. If you are a registered member of Glam.com, we may notify you by e-mail of material changes to our Privacy and Security Policy using the most current e-mail address you have provided to us. Your continued access and use of Glam.com will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to our Privacy and Security Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Summary of Our Privacy and Security Policy</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy and Security Policy explains and summarizes how we collect, use, and protect your personal information as you interact with us online and through our customer and technical support. This Privacy and Security Policy explains:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What information Glam gathers from users of Glam.com.<br>
      </li>
      <li>How Glam uses the personal information that you share with us and that we learn about you because of our relationship.<br>
      </li>
      <li>How Glam uses "cookies" and "IP Addresses."<br>
      </li>
      <li>What personal information, if any, Glam may share about you with others and the conditions that protect your information if it must be shared.<br>
      </li>
      <li>What kind of security measures Glam takes to protect your information from loss or disclosure and how Glam will inform you in the event of a security breach.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The circumstances under which you can access your personal information you have shared with Glam and have that information corrected, restrict Glam's use of that information, and even have it removed from our records.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Other things you should know about privacy and Glam.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>The Type of Information Glam.com Collects About You</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Glam collects information that you provide to us or that we learn about you from your use of Glam.com. We receive and store information you enter on Glam.com or give to us in any other way. For example, you may provide information to Glam.com when you register, sign-in, search, add items to your shopping cart, participate in a test profile or survey, request our e-mail newsletters, or communicate with Glam's customer service. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and personal shopping and product preferences. We also automatically receive and store certain types of information whenever you visit Glam.com. We might also receive information about you from other sources, such as in providing you special offers that we think will be of interest, and we may add that information to our account information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>How Glam Uses Information About You</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We use information we have collected about you to provide you with the very best fashion and personal style news, products and services, and shopping experience. <b>We do not sell your personal information to third parties for any reason.</b> We do not disclose your personal information to unaffiliated third parties who may want to offer you their own products and services unless you have requested or authorized us to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may share your personal information with third parties or affiliates of Glam where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something you have asked us to do. For example, we might need to provide your personal information to retailers whose merchandise is featured on Glam.com so they can process and fulfill your request to buy merchandise.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may share your personal information to third parties or affiliates of Glam with whom we have contracted to perform services on our behalf. All companies that act on our behalf are contractually obligated to keep the personal information we provide to them confidential and to use the personal information we share only to provide the services we ask them to perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may disclose personal information about our customers as permitted or required by law, such as in connection with a subpoena or similar legal process, or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy, as discussed further below.
    </p>
    <p>
      We try to provide you with the information you need to make informed reasonable choices with respect to how Glam.com uses or shares your information. Glam collects and uses personal information from you in several ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Website Usage.</b> Glam or Glam's authorized service providers may observe activities, preferences, and transactional data (such as your IP address, browser type, and operating system) relating to your use of Glam.com. We may use this collected or logged information in order to provide better service, to facilitate our customers' use of the website, to track usage of the website, and to address security hazards. Glam, or one of Glam's authorized service providers, may use this information to track aggregate traffic patterns throughout Glam.com. We may use aggregated, statistical information to describe our customer audience, products and services, and to develop partnerships with third parties to offer products and services in which we believe our customers will be interested. For example, if 30 percent of our customers are interested in the latest handbags and accessories, we may share that statistic with handbag and accessory retailers in order to offer through Glam.com the type of merchandise our customers want.<br>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Online Transactions.</b> We collect information about you when you use our website. You may visit our site without registering, but if you wish to add merchandise to your shopping cart, take a test, create a shopping book, "Shop Together," or use other special features offered on our site, you will need to provide us with certain information, including your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, to open an account with us. We will assist you in creating a user ID and a password to protect your account information.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this time, when you request to purchase items in your shopping cart, we will forward your request and basic account information to the retailer or ecommerce service provider. When you provide personal financial and other personally identifiable information to the retailers or service providers featured through Glam.com, the sales transaction will occur on the retailer's or service provider's site and not on Glam.com. As such, the financial and personally identifiable information you provide in placing your order is controlled by that retailer or service provider. In the future, Glam.com may conduct some or all of these sales transactions itself, but at this time, it only facilitates your requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you provide to us information about a friend through the "Invite a Friend" section of Glam.com, we will first contact that friend by e-mail to confirm that the friend wishes to participate in Glam.com activities and consents to having personal information about him or her collected and retained by Glam.com. If your friend does not consent to our use of his or her contact information, we will delete it from our records.
        </p>
        <p>
          Glam may offer Open Group Tests ("OGT"). To take our OGT, you and any of your friends who may wish to participate must be registered with Glam.com. Through our comparative scorecard, Glam will allow you to create a list of your friends and to compare your results with theirs. It works like this: You tell us whom to invite; our technology invites them on your behalf to participate in the OGT. Once your friend takes the test, you will receive an e-mail notice from Glam that his or her results are in. On the "results" page, which every invited participant can access and review, you can see their OGT results, first name, and e-mail address, and how you match up in certain categories. You can view your "personal invitation list" and who has yet to participate. The personal invitation list can only be seen by you as the inviter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our "Shop Together" feature operates in a similar fashion. Each friend that you ask us to invite on your behalf to shop together with you must also be registered with Glam.com. We will e-mail you when your friend is ready to shop or is done shopping. You both will be able to view and compare each other's shopping selections.<br>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Public Areas.</b> Any information disclosed in public areas of Glam.com is public information that may be viewed and collected by any party. We cannot control the use of information disclosed in the social networking, chat rooms, reviews, or bulletin board portions of our site. You should exercise caution when disclosing information, including photos or images, in these public areas and should refrain from disclosing personally identifying information. If you wish to use some of the public portions on our site, we will direct you to first create a public ID, which is not your real e-mail address, before you can post information to our site. Glam reserves the right to remove any information at any time from our site that we deem inappropriate or for any other reason.<br>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Our Security Practices</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our internal data security policies restrict access to customers' personal information to authorized employees. Authorized employees may use our customers' personal information for Glam business purposes only. Our employees are bound by Glam policies that require them to maintain the confidentiality of our customers' personal information. Employees who violate these requirements are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
    </p>
    <p>
      We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that are designed to guard our customers' personal information. For example, for the security of your online visit to Glam.com, we may make use of firewall barriers, encryption techniques, and/or authentication procedures. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Glam cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your personal information, we will notify you as necessary so you can take appropriate protective steps. Unless you indicate otherwise, we may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address you provided to us when you registered with Glam.com.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>What Are Cookies and How Does Glam.com Use Them?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We may use "cookies" to collect or log certain information. A cookie is a small piece of information that a website stores on a personal computer and which it can later retrieve. The cookie identifier associated with your browser is the same cookie identifier used when you visit other websites that use our advertising services (collectively, "Glam Network"). We may use cookies for informational purposes-for example, to store our customers' preferences for certain kinds of products or to serve advertisements tailored to a customer's preferences. The cookies will not contain information that will enable anyone to contact our customers via telephone, e-mail, or any other means. If our customers are uncomfortable with the use of cookie technology, they can choose to opt out of our cookies at any time by clicking <a href="http://www.glammedia.com/about_glam/legal/optout.php">here</a>, or they can set their browsers to refuse cookies. If a user utilizes more than one type of browser, or more than one computer to access the Internet, they will need to opt out in each browser and on each computer that they use. Certain of our services, however, could be dependent on cookies, and our customers may disable those services by refusing cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that third parties, which may include advertising networks and advertisers, serving ads on Glam.com and/or the Glam Network, and the independent site publishers in the Glam Network, may also use their own cookies. Glam does not control these cookies or the data collection practices of these companies. For more information about these companies' separate privacy policies, you should contact the company directly. If the advertising network is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), you may be able to opt out of receiving targeted advertising delivered by NAI members by following the opt-out directions on www.networkadvertising.org.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>What Privacy Policies Cover the Ads on Glam.com?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We may use third-party advertising networks to serve ads on Glam.com. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single-pixel GIFs or Web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is not connected to personally identifiable information, such as your name and e-mail address. For more information about these companies' separate privacy policies, you should contact the advertising network directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Links to Third-Party Sites and Websites Containing Glam.com Branding</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Glam.com may contain links to third-party sites. Please be aware, however, that Glam is not responsible for and cannot control the privacy policies of these other sites or their practices. We encourage you to read the privacy policies for these other sites, as they may differ from ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website may also contain links to sites in the Glam Network which are maintained by third parties that display Glam.com branding and/or Glam's logo. Such websites may be identified in that they do not display a "Glam.com" URL. Please read the privacy policy on these sites for applicable privacy practices relating to personal information collected via those sites because they may differ from Glam.com's privacy practices. This Privacy and Security Policy applies solely to personal information collected by Glam.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Contact Preferences and Accessing Your Personal Information</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      You have choices when it comes to how Glam uses your personal information. When you register online with Glam.com, you can choose not to receive information about merchandise, services, and special promotional offers from us by direct mail and/or e-mail. If you elect not to receive such product marketing information by direct mail or e-mail, Glam may continue to contact you as necessary to service your account. You can change your contact preferences at any time by following the instructions for My Profile on Glam.com.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your test answers and results, both for your individual and OGT results, can be viewed in the My Tests section of our site. You can delete this information at any time by following the instructions on the My Tests section of Glam.com.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping your account information accurate and up-to-date is very important, so we can provide you with excellent service. If your account information is incomplete, inaccurate, or not current, please follow the instructions for My Account on Glam.com to correct your account information online.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need additional assistance, please contact Glam customer service at www.glam.com/customerservice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>This Privacy and Security Policy Applies to U.S. Customers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Glam.com is hosted in the United States and is intended for United States visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy and Security Policy applies to customer relationships established in the United States. Parts of this Privacy and Security Policy may not apply to visitors outside the United States. Like almost every website, Glam.com may be accessed by an international audience. If you are a non-U.S. visitor to our website, by visiting our website and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed for the purposes identified in this Privacy and Security Policy. In addition, such data may be stored on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction, which may have less stringent privacy practices than your own. By providing us with your data, you consent to transfer of such data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mergers, Acquisitions, and Bankruptcy</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If Glam should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if Glam should decide to buy another business or sell or reorganize part or all of Glam's business, Glam may be required to disclose your personal information to prospective or actual purchasers and other parties. It is Glam's practice to obtain appropriate protections for information disclosed in these types of transactions. Glam cannot, however, guarantee that Glam's Privacy and Security Policy will remain unchanged if Glam is sold or merges with another company.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glam.com Is Not for Use by Children</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Children are not eligible to use Glam.com. We ask that minors (under the age of 18) only use Glam.com in conjunction with your parents or guardians. Children under 13 should not send any information about themselves to Glam. If a child under 13 submits information through any part of Glam.com, and Glam becomes aware that the person submitting the information is a child, we will attempt to delete this information as soon as possible. Because we do not knowingly collect any personal information about children under 13, we do not use or disclose such information to third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>What Else Should I Know About My Privacy?</b>
