<p>Glam Media Ltd. (“We”) are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.</p>
<p align="left">This Privacy Policy (together with our <a href="http://glammedia.co.uk/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.</p>
<p>Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.</p>

<p>We own and operate this website (the “Site”) and other websites focused on women, men, and social media consumers (collectively the “Glam Media Sites”). We also operate an advertising network consisting of websites to which we may deliver advertising.</p>
