 <h3>3.WHAT IS A COOKIE?</h3>
 <p>A cookie is a tiny element of data that is stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser when you access a website. The Site makes use of the following types of cookie technology:</p>
 <p>• A "Session cookie", which contains a random ID number automatically allocated to your computer by the webserver for the duration of your visit.

It will be deactivated after thirty minutes of inactivity on the Site and will be automatically removed from your computer when you close your browser.<br>
 • A "Script generated cookie" is automatically allocated to your computer when you register to access any restricted areas of the Site and on each subsequent visit. It only contains an identifier which will enable the Site to identify you as a registered user so that you do not have to identify yourself again while you move from one server to another during your visit. It will remain on your computer after your visit until you remove it. It will be placed again at your next visit.</p>
 <h3>Third-Party Cookies</h3>
 <p>We may use third-party advertising companies or affiliates to display advertisements on our website.
