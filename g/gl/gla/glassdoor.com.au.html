(“<strong>Glassdoor</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, or “<strong>us</strong>”) takes the privacy and protection of personal information very seriously. By visiting the Site, registering as a Member or using the Services, you acknowledge and accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalised terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Glassdoor Terms of Use, which can be found at <a href="/about/terms.htm" data-transition="slide">http://www.glassdoor.com.au/about/terms.htm</a> and which incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference. This Privacy Policy describes Glassdoor's practices with respect to the Personal Information that we collect when you use the Services. </p> <p> “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” is information that is personally identifiable like names, addresses, e-mail addresses, or phone numbers, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing. We collect and use Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy from the Users of our Services. </p> <p class="strong allCaps"> BY USING THE SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. </p> <p class="strong allCaps">YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.</p> <h2><strong>Information We Collect</strong></h2> <p>We collect the following Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily:</p> <ul> <li> Our Member registration process to create an Account requires you to provide us with your e-mail address and password of your choice.

Please be aware that while some pieces of information that you provide to us would not be sufficient to identify you when seen by another User without any context, the combination of different pieces of information that you have provided for viewing by other Users, or any contextual information, may allow other Users to identify you. </li> <li> When you contact us by sending us an e-mail or when you use any of our contact forms, we will collect any information that is contained in (and/or attached to) your e-mail, text message, or that you enter into such forms. </li> </ul> <h2><strong>Personal Information from Facebook</strong></h2> <p> The following section sets forth the data collection and usage policies and practices that apply to when you use our Facebook Application or when you join or sign in (“<strong>Connect</strong>”) to Glassdoor using your Facebook Account (collectively all called “<strong>the App</strong>”).

We may use this anonymised information for internal purposes, such as analysing usage patterns so that we may enhance the Services, and we also reserve the right to use and disclose such anonymised information at our discretion. </p> <p> If you choose to use our service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and ensuring multiple invitations are not sent. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:72i6179su%70po%72t@g%6ca73%64o%6f%72%2ec%6f%6d">privacysupport@glassdoor.com</a> or through <a href="/about/contact_input.htm">Contact Us</a> to request that we remove this information from our database. </p> <h2><strong>Public Postings</strong></h2> <p>One of the purposes of the Services is for Members to share employment-related information with other Users. Therefore, you should assume that any information (including any Personal Information you may choose to provide, but excluding your registration information) that you post will be made available to other Users of the Services. We may provide you the ability to anonymously post certain comments, in which case we will not include your contact information (i.e., name, email address, or postal address) on the Site in connection with such comments. However, you should know that our internal records may associate your contact information with such comments.</p> <h2><strong>Feedback</strong></h2> <p>If you provide feedback about the Services to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any purpose, provided we do not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. We will collect any information contained in such feedback and will treat the Personal Information in it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p> <h2><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong></h2> <p>Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose to, or share your Personal Information with, third parties, unless you ask or authorise us to do so.</p> <p>We may provide your Personal Information to third party service providers and suppliers who work on behalf of or with us to provide you with some of the services and features of the Services and to help us communicate with our Users. However, these service providers and suppliers do not have any independent right to use this information except to help us provide the Services.</p> <p>We may share some or all of your Personal Information with any parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “<strong>Affiliates</strong>”), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.</p> <p>In the event Glassdoor goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Glassdoor or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p> <p>We may (and you authorise us to) disclose information we have collected from and about you (including Personal Information) if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; (b) to enforce our Glassdoor Terms of Use and Privacy Policy; or (c) to protect and defend the rights or property of us, the users of our Services or third parties.</p> <h2><strong>Choices Regarding Personal Information</strong></h2> <p> You may change your Personal Information (i.e., email address) by logging into the service and editing your account information from within My Account. </p> <p> We may provide you with the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. </p> <p> We may send newsletters, promotional communications or other similar messaging to our users on our behalf and on behalf of our partners. You may opt-out of receiving such messaging by following the instructions included in each message. We may also offer you an opportunity to opt-out of certain communications by logging into the service and editing your account information from within My Account. </p> <p> We may send you service-related announcements when we believe it is necessary to do so. Generally, you may not opt-out of these announcements, which are not primarily promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to deactivate your Account. </p> <p> We may notify you when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party. </p> <p> You may request that your Account be terminated and that your Personal Information be deleted by sending an email to <a href="mailto:72i6179su%70po%72t@g%6ca73%64o%6f%72%2ec%6f%6d">privacysupport@glassdoor.com</a> or through <a href="/about/contact_input.htm">Contact Us</a>. Any termination of your account may involve deletion of your Account information from our live databases and all the information and data stored for such Account in the Services. Glassdoor will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any termination of your account or related deletion of you information. </p> <p> When we delete Personal Information that we have collected from or about you, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives. </p> <h2><strong>Links to Other Web Sites</strong></h2> <p>The Services may contain links to other web sites that are not owned or controlled by Glassdoor. The provision of such links is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such web sites or location or its contents.

Please be aware that the terms of our Privacy Policy do not apply to any outside web sites.</p> <h2><strong>Ad Servers</strong></h2> <p>We may allow advertisers to place advertisements on the Site. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third party. The third-party ad server may use Cookies or web beacons in connection with these advertisements. This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection of information by these third-party ad servers through the use of Cookies, web beacons, or other means. For information about our advertising partners, please visit their websites through the links included in the presentation of the advertisements.</p> <h2><strong>Privacy of Minors</strong></h2> <p>We do not intentionally collect or maintain information in the Services from those visitors and Users of the Services who are under 13 years old.</p> <h2><strong>Security Safeguards</strong></h2> <h3>Security</h3> <p> Glassdoor has put in place commercially reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
