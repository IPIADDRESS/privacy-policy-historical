                <p>GlassWire collects information from you when you register on our website or forum, email us, place an order, subscribe to our newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form or download or install our software.</p>

                <p>When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your: name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number or credit card information.</p>

                        <p>GlassWire Installation</p>
                        <p>When installing GlassWire our installer will contact GlassWire.com so we can understand how many installs of our software have occurred.  This helps us estimate how many users we have.  If we did not count installs of GlassWire it would be kind of like having a website and not knowing if anyone was visiting it or not.  Thank you for allowing us to count installs of our software.</p>
                        <p>After installing GlassWire you may notice on GlassWire's graph that GlassWire itself contacts GlassWire.com around once per day.  GlassWire checks for software updates that may contain important security fixes and also updates its suspicious host list.  GlassWire can block itself from accessing the Internet however if you do so then you may not know about important software updates and your suspicious host list may no longer be up to date.</p>
