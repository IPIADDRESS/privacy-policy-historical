                <h3>Commitment to Privacy</h3>
                <p>GlassWire is committed to protecting your privacy by collecting only the minimum amount of information needed to provide our software, website, and services. Our company mission is to help people protect their privacy, data, and devices from threats.</p>

                <h3>Privacy Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                <h3>Can you see or collect my network or graph data?</h3>
                <p><b>No. Your network and graph data stays on your device and is never sent to our GlassWire servers.</b>
                    We could not see or collect your GlassWire network or graph data even under a court order because we have no access to your
                    network or graph data. Our business model is to sell our premium GlassWire software, not to collect or sell your network data
                    to advertisers.</p>

                <h3>Why does GlassWire’s desktop software access the network?</h3>
                <p>GlassWire’s software for desktop computers checks for software updates that may contain important security fixes along with
                    updating its suspicious host list. GlassWire can block itself from accessing the network, however if you do so then you may
                    not know about important software updates and GlassWire may not alert you if you connect to a suspicious host.
                    GlassWire’s Android app does not access the network and has no suspicious host feature.</p>

                <h3>Why does GlassWire for Android request the “phone” permission?</h3>
                <p>The Android OS requires the “phone” permission for us to see your mobile phone network data. Without this mobile phone
                    permission, it’s impossible for our app to graph your phone’s mobile data. All similar Android apps work the same way. You can
                    learn more details about this <a href="https://blog.glasswire.com/2017/04/18/glasswire-android-permissions/">on our Blog</a>.
                    Of course GlassWire does not make phone calls with your phone and our Android app never accesses the network.</p>

                <h3>How does GlassWire make money?</h3>
                <p>We make money through sales of our software. If you want to support future development of GlassWire you can
                    <a href="/buy/">purchase GlassWire here</a>.</p>

                <h3>I have a question or request about the EU GDPR, how can I contact you?</h3>
                <p>If your request concerns a purchase of our software please
                    <a href="https://www.cleverbridge.com/corporate/contact-us/" rel="nofollow">contact our billing company Cleverbridge directly</a>.
                    Cleverbridge is compliant with the GDPR and can make any GDPR related personal information requests you need. The GlassWire software does not collect
                    personal information, but if you have a GDPR request regarding our websites please contact us directly so we can assist you.
                    If you purchased our software and if you need to do something with your data as allowed by the GDPR please contact Cleverbridge, since they hold any personal data related to GlassWire sales.</p>

                <h3>What information does GlassWire collect?</h3>
                <p>GlassWire collects information from you when you register on our website or forum, email us, place an order, subscribe to our
                    newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form or download or install our software.</p>
                <p>When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your: name, e-mail address, mailing address,
                    phone number or credit card information.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>GlassWire Installation Process</p>
                        <p>When installing or uninstalling GlassWire’s desktop software, our installer will contact GlassWire.com so we can know how many installs of our software have occurred. This contact sends your software version number, OS version, and if you’ve installed GlassWire before, along with an anonymized partial IP address and anonymized machine ID to us estimate how many users we have. Our mobile software does not contact GlassWire.com at all because we use the installation stats provided by the Google Play Android store.  When uninstalling GlassWire for Windows you have the option to visit our uninstall web page where you have the option to submit the reason that you uninstalled our software.</p>
                        <p>After installing GlassWire for the PC you may notice on GlassWire's graph that GlassWire itself contacts GlassWire.com around once per day. GlassWire for the desktop checks for software updates that may contain important security fixes and also updates its suspicious host list. GlassWire can block itself from accessing the Internet however if you do so then you may not know about important software updates and your suspicious host list may no longer be up to date. Please note our suspicious host list does not come from GlassWire users. We can never see your network data. Our mobile software does not contact GlassWire.com at all because it has no suspicious host lists and it updates through the Google Play Android store.
                            GlassWire does not collect any personal information through this daily update/software check.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Google Analytics on GlassWire.com</p>
                        <p>Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to check website stats. Google's use of the cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.</p>
                        <p>GlassWire also has web logs that keep IP addresses for a short time, then automatically deletes them. These logs are kept to help keep our website online, and secure.</p>
                        <p>To block cookies on GlassWire.com set your browser to not allow cookies, or use a third party tool like “Ghostery” to block cookies.</p>

                        <p>GlassWire Activation Codes (Desktop Only)</p>
                        <p>GlassWire Basic, Pro, Elite and other paid desktop products sometimes use activation codes to unlock GlassWire's paid features. When activating GlassWire Basic, Pro, or Elite the GlassWire software will contact GlassWire.com and check to see if the activation code should be authenticated or not and to see how many machines are using that code. GlassWire keeps an anonymized record of your activation code as related to your computer so it can see how many devices are using your code.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What does the GlassWire website use your information for?</h3>

                <h3>Does GlassWire use cookies on their website or in their software?</h3>
                <p>Yes (Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computers hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information).</p>

However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. For example we use Google Analytics to check stats for our website. We also list our mobile software in the Google Play Android store which has its own separate privacy policy.</p>
                <p>If GlassWire’s organization structure changes (for example if we undergo restructuring or are acquired) we may need to move your personal information (if we have any) to a third party related to a business transaction.</p>
