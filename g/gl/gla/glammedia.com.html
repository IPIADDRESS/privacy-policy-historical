<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glam Media, Inc. (“Glam Media”) owns and operates this website (the “Site”) and other websites focused on women, men, and social media consumers, (collectively the “Glam Media Sites”).

Glam Media may, from time to time, also deliver advertising to websites owned by third-party publishers that are not part of the Glam Media Network (“Non-Affiliated Sites”). This Privacy and Security Policy applies to (i) the collection of information on the Glam Media Sites that link to or display this Privacy and Security Policy and the use of that information, (ii) the collection of information on the Affiliated Sites and the use of that information when you view ads from our advertisers, and (iii) the collection of information on the Non-Affiliated Sites and the use of that information when you view ads from our advertisers.</p>

<h1>Use of Cookies, Log Files, GlamAdapt, and Other Technology</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glam Media may use “cookies” on the websites participating in the Glam Media Network and Non-Affiliated Sites to collect or log certain information. A cookie is a small piece of information that a website stores on a personal computer and which it can later retrieve. The cookie identifier associated with your browser is the same cookie identifier used when you visit websites in the Glam Media Network and Non-Affiliated Sites. Glam Media owns and operates GlamAdapt, an online advertising product that may provide ad delivery and reporting across various websites, including the Glam Media Network and Non-Affiliated Sites. Glam Media may also use cookies for informational purposes, for example, to store our customers’ preferences for certain kinds of products or to serve advertisements tailored to a customer’s preferences. The cookies will not contain information that will enable anyone to contact our customers via telephone, e-mail, or any other means.&nbsp;<strong>If you are uncomfortable with the use of cookie technology, you can choose to opt out of our cookies at any time by clicking&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.glammedia.com/about_glam/legal/opt-out"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>, or you can set your browsers to refuse cookies.&nbsp;</strong>Please note, if you use more than one type of browser, or more than one computer to access the Internet, you will need to opt out in each browser and on each computer that you use.

<h1>Information Collection on Websites Participating in the Glam Media Network and on Non-Affiliated Sites</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you visit any of the websites that participate in the Glam Media Network or a Non-Affiliated Site and view ads from Glam Media’s advertisers, Glam Media automatically receives and stores certain types of non-personally identifiable information including IP address, web pages viewed, date and time, and responses to advertisements delivered by GlamAdapt or third-party ad serving technologies. While each advertising technology uses different types of technology to collect this information, including log files, cookies and pixels, none of the foregoing by itself or together can be tracked to a specific individual’s personally identifiable information, and the non-personally identifiable information collected by Glam Media will not be shared with third parties, except as expressly indicated in this Privacy and Security Policy. The non-personally identifiable information collected through your use of the Glam Media Sites and the websites of the Glam Media Network, is used to provide relevant, targeted advertising and improve Glam Media’s advertising technology; monitor website traffic; collect statistical data; determine the effectiveness of advertisements and content; and collect data across multiple websites to categorize likely consumer interest segments for use in online behavioral advertising (“OBA”). Glam Media may track visits to the Glam Media Network and this information may be used over time to help predict your consumer interest segments and select the ad content you see. Glam Media may also use non-personally identifiable profile-based anonymous information with other non-personally identifiable information that Glam Media has obtained from GlamAdapt, third-party ad serving technologies, the Glam Media Network, and Non-Affiliated Sites.&nbsp;<a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a>If you wish to opt out of receiving Glam Media’s customized targeted advertisements, you may opt out as indicated below at<a href="http://www.glammedia.com/about_glam/legal/privacy-security#_YourChoicetoOptOut:GlamMediaNetworkandNon-AffiliatedSites"> Your Choice to Opt Out: Glam Media Network and Non-Affiliated Sites</a>.</p>

<h2><em>Transparency in Online Behavioral Advertising by Glam Media</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Online behavioral advertising (sometimes called “interest-based advertising” or “OBA”) uses information collected through your Web browser as you visit multiple websites in order to predict your preferences and show you relevant advertising. Glam Media does not create or use potentially sensitive data segments to provide its targeted online behavioral advertising for brand advertisers. However, we recognize that consumers may have differing opinions regarding which data segments are sensitive. In compliance with industry standards Glam Media provides transparency around health related audience segments collected and used by our technology solutions. We may use health related audience segments such as Health.CardioHealth, Wellness.DietNutrition, and Family.Pregnancy.

<h2><em>Our Security Practices</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our internal data security policies restrict access to customers’ personal information to authorized employees. Authorized employees may use our customers’ personal information for Glam Media business purposes only. Our employees are bound by Glam Media policies that require them to maintain the confidentiality of our customers’ personal information. Employees who violate these requirements are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.<br>
We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that are designed to guard our customers’ personal information. For example, for the security of your online visit to a Glam Media Site, we may make use of firewall barriers, encryption techniques, and/or authentication procedures. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Glam Media cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your personal information, we will notify you as necessary so you can take appropriate protective steps. Unless you indicate otherwise, we may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address you provided to us when you registered with the Glam Media Site.</p>

<h2><em>Our Data Sharing Practices</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We do not sell your personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable information to third parties for any reason.&nbsp;</strong>We do not disclose your personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties who may want to offer you their own products and services unless you have requested or authorized us to do so. We may share your personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information with third parties, or affiliates of Glam Media where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something you have asked us to do. For example, we might need to provide your personally identifiable information to third parties, such as advertisers, featured on a Glam Media Site, or through a website participating in the Glam Media Network or a Non-Affiliated Site so they can process and fulfill your request for more information from them; and in these instances, we will provide you with a notice at the time of collection that the information is being shared, to whom it is being shared and the privacy policy governing the use of the information collected and shared. We may share your personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information with third parties with whom we have contracted to perform services on our behalf, or affiliates of Glam Media. All companies that act on our behalf are contractually obligated to keep the personal information we provide to them confidential and to use the personal information we share only to provide the services we ask them to perform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may disclose personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information about our customers as permitted or required by law, such as in connection with a subpoena or similar legal process, or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy, as discussed further below.</p>
