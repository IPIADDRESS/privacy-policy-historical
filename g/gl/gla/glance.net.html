					Glance Networks, Inc. collects personal information such as name, address, e-mail address and billing 
					information when you knowingly provide it to us. Our Web servers or a third party web analytics company may automatically collect statistical 
					information about your visit such as pages visited and which browsers are used to visit our site. 
					None of this information is associated with you as an individual (see information about cookies), unless and until you sign up for a Glance account.  
					If collected, we would use these statistics to monitor our site's performance and to make it easier 
					for you to use.</p>

                    When you supply information for a specific purpose such as ordering a service from 
					Glance Networks, we use the information for the purpose of providing that service. If 
					the way we use personally identifiable information changes, Glance Networks, Inc. will 
					contact you via e-mail notifying you of this change and giving you the opportunity to 
					opt out of such use.</p>

					<a name="4"></a>
					<p><span class="faq_question">Do you sell or give my information to non-Glance Networks, Inc. companies?</span><br>
                    No, we do not sell individually identifiable information obtained on-line about our 
					visitors to anyone outside of Glance Networks, Inc. The only exception to this rule 
					is if we are required by law to release information.</p>
					<p>If you provide individually identifiable information at an event Glance Networks, 
					Inc. sponsors with another company, or if you subscribe or register on a co-sponsored 
					or co-branded Web site, you may be providing the individually identifiable information 
					to the co-sponsor. Review the privacy statement on the co-branded site to learn how the 
					partner uses this information. Be assured that Glance Networks, Inc. uses this information 
					in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
					<p>On occasion, Glance Networks, Inc. shares non-personally identifiable information 
					with non-Glance Networks, Inc. companies in order to assess the results of a promotion. 
					This information is used in aggregate only, and does not contain any information that would 
					personally identify you. Information could be shared with an authorized Glance Networks 
					reseller to fulfill a request for information or to follow up on an inquiry. We will inform 
					you when your personally identifiable information is being shared and for what purposes.</p>
					<p>Personal information submitted to Glance Networks through this Site may be 
					transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the 
					countries in which Glance Networks its affiliates or authorized resellers maintain 
					offices, including, without limitation, the United States. You also acknowledge that 
					in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, 
					storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of 
					Glance Networks. Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal 
					information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.</p>

					<p><span class="faq_question">Does Glance Networks use cookies and what does Glance 
					do with the information collected?</span><br>
                    Yes. A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web 
					server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your 
					identification card. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.</p>
					<p>Glance sets a session cookie when you log into your personal account at the Glance 
					web site, so the site knows that you are logged in. The cookie is removed when you 
					exit your browser. Glance also sets a cookie on your guest's computer when they view a 
					Glance session. The cookie may be read if, at a future date, the person subscribes to 
					the Glance service. This allows Glance to measure non-personally identifiable statistics 
					on how users learned about the service.</p>
					<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to 
					notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to 
					accept it. We may also use a cookie to make it easier for you to login and to help us 
					determine site traffic patterns. This cookie contains no personal information other 
					than your Glance Address. You can refuse to accept this cookie and still use Glance.</p>
					<p>If you are a "cookie-phobe," you can set your browser to not accept any cookies, 
					not accept permanent cookies, or tell it to erase all cookies at the end of a session. 
					You will not be able to log into your Glance account if you refuse Glance's non-permanent 
					session cookie.</p>

					<p><span class="faq_question">What does Glance Networks, Inc. do with personally identifiable information?</span><br>

					Personal information you voluntarily supply when obtaining information, purchasing 
					services or interacting with our advertising may be shared with authorized resellers 
					or affiliates of Glance Networks, Inc. However, you will be informed when such 
					information is shared and will be given an opportunity to opt out. Should any changes 
					be made in the way we use personally identifiable information, Glance Networks, Inc. 
					will contact you via e-mail notifying you of this change and give you the opportunity 
					to choose to opt out of such use.</p>

					<p><span class="faq_question">Does this site send e-mail to site visitors?</span><br>

					At times, we may utilize e-mail for any of these reasons:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bpad">To conduct online surveys</li>
						<li class="bpad">To respond to a site visitor's e-mail</li>
						<li class="bpad">To confirm orders placed online</li>
						<li class="bpad">To send information that a visitor has requested</li>
						<li class="bpad">To respond to a "Tell a Friend" request</li>
						<li class="bpad">To reset a password</li>
						<li>To periodically distribute a newsletter</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Occasionally, we may use opt-in e-mail lists from third parties to promote our 
					latest specials. In all of these situations you will be provided with direction on 
					how to opt out of future e-mails of this nature.</p>

					<p><span class="faq_question">What about children and privacy?</span><br>

					Because of the nature of our business, our Web site is not designed to appeal to 
					children under the age of 13. Therefore, we do not knowingly attempt to solicit or 
					receive any information from children.</p>
                    <p class="rt_align"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

					<a name="9"></a>
					<p><span class="faq_question">How Does Glance Networks, Inc. protect my personal information?</span><br>

                    We are committed to protecting the information you give us, so we implement the 
					appropriate safeguards to do so. Any information that you give us is protected by a 
					password for added security. Within Glance Networks, Inc., your information is stored 
					in password-protected, limited-access servers. Wherever possible, Glance Networks, Inc. 
					servers reside behind a firewall that maintains tight controls on any access to the
