<p><a name="_Toc417047092"></a><a name="_Toc417047031"></a>We collect two types of information from you when you visit our Sites or register to use our Products and Services: (1) “personally identifiable information” (as defined below) and (2) non-personally identifiable information (as defined below).</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc417996415"></a><a name="_Toc417047555"></a><a name="_Toc417047093"></a><a name="_Toc417047032"></a>Personal Identifiable Information (“PII”)</h1>
<p>Personally identifiable information includes, but is not limited to, your name, company name, address, email, phone number, financial, billing or payment information, position, or title. We use your PII mainly to provide you with the Products and Services, administer your inquires and complete your transactions.</p>
<p><a name="_Toc417047556"></a><a name="_Toc417047094"></a><a name="_Toc417047033"></a>Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“NPII”)</p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, gender, or interests. NPII may also mean aggregated, non-identifiable or anonymized information. NPII does not identify you personally. If you do provide us with non-personally identifiable information, we may use it for the purposes described in this statement or where it is collected, or any other legal purpose.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the ways in which we may collect and store your non-personally identifiable information through our services, and how we use such information:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Log Information</span>. When you use our services or view content provided by Glew.™ we automatically collect and store certain information in our server logs. This type of information includes details of how you used our service, IP address information described below, web pages which have been viewed by a visitor, data and time, domain type, device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware, settings, browser type or version, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Internet Protocol (IP) address.</span> Your “IP address” is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data, such as the screens and pages of our services that you view. We use this information to deliver our screens and pages to you upon request, to tailor our services to the interests of you and our other visitors, and to measure traffic to and within our services.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Demographic Information</span>. “Demographic information” may be your gender, age, zip code, and interests. We may collect such information about you through our services and use it to provide you with personalized services and to analyze trends to ensure that our services and the information on them is targeted to meet your needs. Please note that we also consider aggregated information, which is not personally identifiable, to be non-personally identifiable information.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc417996416"></a><a name="_Toc417047557"></a><a name="_Toc417047095"></a><a name="_Toc417047034"></a>Sharing and Disclosure of PII and NPII</h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personally Identifiable Information</span>. Primarily, we may share or disclose your PII in the following instances:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To fulfill a service to you.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you email us a question, we may use your email address to process your request and respond to your question.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To offer you products from our affiliates, strategic partners, agents, or from third-party marketers and other unaffiliated parties that we believe may be of interest to you, or to assist such parties for research, administrative, and/or business purposes.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These parties may contact you with an offer or advertisement related to a product or service, or they may use such information for their own research, administration or business purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents, or independent contractors who help us maintain our services and us with other administrative services (including, but not limited to, order processing and fulfillment, providing customer service, maintaining and analyzing data, sending customer communications on our behalf, and entry collection, winner selection and prize fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions). </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Company requires these service-related companies to comply with the principles set out in the Privacy Policy, and requires them to use such information only for the purposes for which it was provided to them</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To complete your purchase.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to make a purchase of one of our Products or on or through our Services, we may ask you for your credit card number, billing address, and other information in connection with completing such purchase, and we may use such information to fulfill your purchase. We may also provide such information, or other PII provided by you, to unaffiliated third-parties to complete your purchase (for example, to process your credit card).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To comply with law, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the requirements of law, or comply with legal process served on us, and to protect and defend our rights or property, including our rights and property and our services, or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of you and our other visitors.</strong></li>
<li><strong>To third parties as part of a corporate reorganization process including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.</strong></li>
<li><strong>To track and analyze NPII, i.e. non-identifying, aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.</strong></li>
<li><strong>To protect against fraud and potential fraud.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We may verify the information you provide to obtain our Products and Services through third parties. In the course of such verification, we may receive additional PII about you from such services. In particular, if you use a credit card or debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address match the information you supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-personally identifiable information</span>. We may share and disclose your NPII for the purposes described in this statement or where it is collected, or any other legal purpose, including, when and where applicable, sharing and disclosing non-personally identifiable information combined with PII.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Legal Disclosure</span>. We may disclose information about you and your use of the Services if we believe that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comply with the law and/or legal process where a formal request has been made (e.g. request from an administrative oversight agency, civil suit, subpoena, court order or judicial or administrative proceeding);</li>
<li>Protect or defend our rights and/or property or the rights and property of others;</li>
<li>Enforce our Terms of Use and/or this Privacy Policy;</li>
<li>Respond to claims that the content(s) of a communication violates the rights of another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, circumstances may arise where, for business reasons, we may decide to reorganize, or divest all or part of our business through sale, assignment, merger or acquisition, or we may acquire a new business. In these circumstances, PII may be shared with the actual or prospective purchasers or assignees, or with the newly acquired business. In such an event, we shall provide notice of any material change to this Privacy Policy, or our Services, in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

Your browser or device may tell us your internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, computer and connection information such as browser type, version, language and time zone setting, browser plug-in types, operating system, and type of device you are using. When you visit the Sites, your browser may also tell us information such as the actions you take on our Sites, the page that led you to our Sites and, if applicable, the search terms you typed into a search engine that led you to our Sites.</p>
<p>You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the Sites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Sites or all functionality of the Services.</p>

<p>No data transmissions over the Internet are completely secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or others over the Internet. You transmit such information at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. We use firewalls to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of such firewalls or secure server software.</p>

<p>We may conduct giveaways, contests and other promotions on the services in which we may ask you for additional information. We use and treat this information in accordance with the terms of this Policy. Participation in such giveaways and contents is not necessary to use the services, and you may choose whether you wish to participate in any particular giveaway or contest, without affecting your general use of the site.</p>

<p>(As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)</p>
<p>A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.</p>
<p>However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy statement) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.</p>
<p>As stated in our privacy policy statement, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure — typically by opting-in to receive information from a third party. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personal information on our website. Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third-party’s privacy policies and practices. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policies and practices of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information. California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing <a href="mailto:support@glew.io">support@glew.io</a>.&nbsp; Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.</p>

<p>Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites and online services that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Such browser features and industry standards are not uniform, so our Sites do not respond to those signals. Our Privacy Policy describes our policies on data collection and tracking.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc417996427"></a><a name="_Toc417047568"></a><a name="_Toc417047106"></a><a name="_Toc417047047"></a>International Transfer of Information</h1>
<p>We may transfer information that we collect about you, including PII, to subsidiary and affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring information about you, including PII, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as the European Union, and you consent to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the transfer of information about you, including PII, to the U.S.; and</li>
<li>the use and disclosure of information about you, including PII, as described in this privacy policy statement.</li>
