         Gleim Publications, Inc. and Gleim Internet, Inc. ("Gleim") understand the importance of
         protecting your personal identifiable information. We respect your right to privacy and
         strive to gather only information that is necessary for providing you with the best services and
         products on the market. By submitting your information to Gleim, you are accepting the
         practices described here.
      </p>
      <p>
         Gleim will ensure that the request of any personal information collected during the
         registration and purchasing processes will not be excessive. Gleim will not disclose any

         by law or otherwise needed in connection with legal proceedings.
      </p>
      <p>
         Gleim may disclose navigational and transactional information in the form of anonymous,
         aggregate usage statistics and demographics, but only in forms that do not reveal a user's
         identity or confidential information.

      <h2 class="contentTitle">GleimTalk Privacy Policy</h2>
      <div class="blueSpace"></div>
      <p>
         Gleim Conferencing, LLC ("<strong>Gleim</strong>") is committed to respecting the privacy of all persons using
         the Gleim website(s) (each, a "<strong>Site</strong>") and the GleimTalk conferencing service (the
         "<strong>Service</strong>"). This Privacy Policy describes the information gathering and dissemination practices
         for the Site and the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
         In order to browse the public portions of a Site, you are not required to provide any personally identifiable
         information (although our websites and third-party software may collect some data and utilize cookies, see
         below).  This Privacy Policy will apply to Gleim's use of such information as you may provide (or that we may
         collect) through your use, viewing and access of the Site and/or the Service. The Service is designed to be an
         online conference service where users may interact with one another as if they were in the same room. Use of
         the Service is available only to users who have accepted Gleim's Terms of Service ("<strong>Terms</strong>").
      </p>
      <p>
         Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on
         the Site and Service.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Information We Collect</strong><br>We may collect the following types of information:
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Information You Provide</strong><br>Visitors to a Site are not required to disclose any personally
         identifiable information to browse the publicly available portions of a Site. Visitors to the Site may provide
         us with certain contact information if they wish to receive information from us, register to receive email
         updates or other news and to create a new account for use of the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
         When you sign up for the Service, we ask you for some basic personal information. This includes personally
         identifying information such as your name, email address, username and a password that you create. Through
         use of the Service you may provide additional information for use and handling by Gleim in connection with
         the provision and maintenance of the Service, and you may also upload, submit or provide additional
         information by participating in Conferences.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Video, Audio and Other Uploaded or Recorded Content for GleimTalk</strong><br>
         When you use the Service to participate in a conference, meeting, seminar, discussion, presentation, virtual
         classroom or other event or interaction utilizing GleimTalk (any of the foregoing referred to as a
         "<strong>Conference</strong>"), information provided by you is immediately transmitted to Gleim, the Conference
         moderator and the other participants in the Conference. In addition, some Conference moderators may be able to
         archive or store the Conferences for future display, transmission, use and/or viewing in the future by
         themselves, persons participating in the Conference and/or others.  Gleim does not control who may be permitted
         access to Conferences; participation or access is determined by the moderator of the Conference. These
         Conferences, or portions thereof, may be available online for extended periods of time.  Therefore, any
         information you upload, enter, submit or permit to be recorded (including without limitation, video or audio
         recording or streaming) when you participate in a Conference may be visible to and accessible to the Conference
         moderator, participants in the Conference and others to whom access is provided to such Conference or portions
         thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
         Without limiting the above, you specifically acknowledge and understand that your username and any User Content
         will be publicly available and viewable by all participants in the Conference. You further acknowledge and
         agree that the Service includes a feature that allows for the Conference to be recorded. By joining a
         Conference you automatically consent to such recordings.  If you do not consent to the recording, you should
         notify the other participants in the Conference and disable the recording feature. However, you understand
         that any participant in the Conference may enable such a recording feature at any time during the Conference with
         or without prior notice to or permission from you.  You should not join or participate in any Conference if you
         do not agree to recording and we shall not be liable to you for any recording of the Conference as described
         herein or in our documentation. For further clarification, information exchanged using the "private chat" or
         similar features will be captured and recorded by Gleim and included in any text files for the Conference.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Cookies</strong><br>When you browse a Site or use the Service, we may send one or more cookies to your
         computer or device. We use cookies to improve the quality of the Sites and Service, including for storing user
         preferences, improving search results, and tracking user trends, such as how people use the Sites and Service.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Automatically Collected Information; Log Information</strong><br>When you visit a Site or access the
         Service via a browser, application or other client our servers automatically record certain information. These
         server logs may include information such as your web request, your interaction with the Service, how long you
         visit a page, how many times you visit a page, information you search for, Internet Protocol address, browser
         type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify
         your browser or your account. When you use the Service using your smartphone or other mobile device, we collect
         information regarding device type, operating system, IP address and device ID. We do not share with third
         parties your personal information as linked with your IP address or device ID.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>User Communications</strong><br>When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those
         communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. We may
         use your email address to communicate with you about our services.
      </p>
      <p><strong>How We Use and Share Information</strong></p>
      <p>
         <strong>Responding to Your Requests</strong><br>If you have provided us information in connection with a request
         to receive information from us about the Service or any of our products or services or register for our mailing
         list, we will use your personally identified information to fulfill your requests and to send you such
         information or our newsletter. If you wish to unsubscribe from our newsletter, you may do so by contacting us
         at support@gleimtalk.com.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Administering the Service</strong><br>We use information you provide and information we automatically
         collect to administer the Service, to allow you and other users to use the Service, and, if applicable, to
         process your payments.  We will also analyze your information and use of the Service in order to improve and
         customize your experience, including remembering information so you will not have to reenter it, and provide
         access to your data or to provide access to recorded Conferences to which you have rights. We may also use such
         information to contact you regarding Service changes, system maintenance and outage issues, or account issues, or
         otherwise troubleshoot problems.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Service Providers</strong><br>We will disclose information to our service providers that work on our
         behalf or with us to fulfill your information requests and to provide the Service.  We do not permit these
         providers to use your information other than as necessary to provide the services to us.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Other Disclosures</strong><br>We may disclose your information, including recordings or Conference
         content, if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is
         reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or other governmental or law
         enforcement request, (b) enforce our Terms of Service including investigation of potential violations, (c)
         detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (d) assist in investigating any
         unauthorized use of the Service or (e) protect against or mitigate harm to the rights, property or safety of
         Gleim, its users, or the public as required or permitted by law.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>With Permission</strong><br>If we use your personal information in a manner different than the purpose
         for which it was collected or other than as disclosed in this policy, then we will ask for your consent prior
         to such use.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Aggregate and Non-personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>We may also use non-personally
         identifiable information (including such as may be aggregated with information of other users so as to no longer be
         personally identifiable to any particular user) to analyze use of our Site and Service.
      </p>
      <p>
         Except as set forth herein, we will not provide your personally identifiable information to any such
         unaffiliated parties for marketing or other purposes without your consent.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Data Retention</strong><br>
         Even after you delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it
         has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed by other participants in a Conference, or it was
         copied or stored by other users. You may not have the authority or ability to remove information (including
         video, audio or other information) you submitted by participating in a Conference, which may be left on the
         Service for later viewing as determined by the Conference moderator for that event.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Corporate Events</strong><br>
         If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, your
         information may be included in the assets sold or transferred to the acquirer. You hereby agree that we may
         transfer or assign the information we have collected from you in connection with any such event. In the event
         of a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership or assignment for the benefit of creditors, we may
         not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred or used.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Information Security</strong><br>
         We will take reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration,
         disclosure or destruction of data. However, we cannot guarantee its absolute security or that unauthorized
         persons will not access or use your personal information for improper purposes. In the event of a breach of
         security affecting personal information or data on our servers, we will take such notification and other steps
         as may be required under applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Accessing and Updating Personal Information</strong><br>
         You may update, change or correct your basic account personal information through the Service. We will update
         your account and information as requested, provided that we may decline to update information if we determine
         it to be impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on recorded Conferences, backup
         tapes or other historical data). In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform
         this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Disclosures</strong></p>
      <p>Social Media Sites</p>
      <p>
         We may have pages or other presence on various social networking sites or services, such as Facebook, Twitter and

         those sites and services.
