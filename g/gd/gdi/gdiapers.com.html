						<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>   
<p>
gDiapers and its subsidiaries (collectively, "Company") recognize privacy as an important issue and have prepared this Privacy Policy to inform you of our data collection and use practices and confirm our commitment to keep your personal information secure. 
</p>
<p>
As Company services evolve, we may revise this policy, so please check back frequently. If you have questions about Company privacy practices please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@gdiapers.com">info@gdiapers.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
Please note that this policy only applies to our data collection and use practices for the Company websites and our other products and services and does not apply to the data collection and use practices of other companies or organizations whose products, services or websites you may use or gain access through the Company websites. For information on the data collection and use practices of those third parties, please refer to their respective policies and procedures.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Information Collection and Use<br>
</strong>Company collects personally identifiable information when you register for a Company account, and when you use certain Company products and services. Company may also receive personally identifiable information from its resellers and other business partners. 
</p>
<p>
When you register with Company, we ask for your contact information (such as your name, street address and email address), as well as certain information pertaining to your business, along with billing information such as a bank account and/or credit card number. 
</p>
<p>

We may also send merchants service announcements, newsletters, and periodic notices about specials and new products.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong><br>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Personally identifiable consumer information is shared with third parties (such as banks and credit card processors) to the extent necessary for Company to deliver payment processing services. 
</p>

<strong>Cookies</strong><br>

<strong>Special Notification with respect to Children's Privacy (Users under the Age of 13)</strong><br>
In response to concerns about protecting children's privacy online, Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which websites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with Company policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable information online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; or </li> 	
	<li>Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties; It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately delete the information from our servers.</li> 
</ul>
<p>
Questions regarding children's privacy should be directed to us at the contact information provided at the end of this privacy policy.
