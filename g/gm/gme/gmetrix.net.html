</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    We comply with the FTC's Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),
    and support the goals and guidelines set forth by industry self-regulatory

<p class="legendp">Definitions</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    For purposes of this Policy, we introduce the definitions of how we

    Identified information is initially collected as Personally Identifiable
    Information, after which we remove any identifying component to make the
    information anonymous.

<hr>

<h1 style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: bold;">What Type of Information Do We Collect and Why?</h1>



<p class="legendp">General</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    We collect the following types of information:
</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Information collected when subscribing:</span> In the registration process of any
    of our subscription types, we ask our subscriber to provide us with first name,
    last name and affiliation with a school or district (if applicable). Providing an
    email is optional. We use this contact information to send users service-
    related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary or advisable
    to do so. For instance, if we perform routine maintenance, we might send an
    informational email. We may also use this contact information to request
    feedback on the use of our products and services, to be used to improve the
    products and services. We will always provide an option to opt out of such
    communications.
</p>
<p class="ppBody">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Username and password:</span> Subscribers create a username and password in
    the registration process, or, if they prefer, we or their school may assign these
    for them. We use usernames and passwords of subscribers' accounts to
    authenticate logins, allow access to the paid content and monitor subscription
    compliance. The username is also used to authenticate users when
    requesting technical support. The passwords are all encrypted when stored.
    For more information on our security practices, see "How We Store and
    Process Your Information" below.
</p>
<p class="ppBody">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Information collected automatically:</span>We automatically receive and record
    information on our server logs from a user’s browser, including the user’s IP
    address. We use IP addresses to maintain a user’s session and we do not
    store them after the user’s session is over. We also use the IP address to
    check if a user is located in some countries outside of the United States where
    a country-wide log-in option is activated, and we do not store this information
    after the initial page load. We do not otherwise combine this information with
    other PII.
</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    We also use a standard feature found in browser software, called a "cookie",
    in order to establish and authenticate user sessions, enable access to paid
    content and monitor potential misuse of the accounts. We do not use cookies
    to collect Personally Identifiable Information nor do we combine such general
    information with other PII to identify a user. Disabling our cookies will prevent
    access to paid content and limit some of the features and functionalities of the
    website or app. To learn more about browser cookies, including how to
    manage or delete them, look in the Tools, Help or similar section of your Web
    browser, or visit allaboutcookies.org.
</p>
<p class="ppBody">
    We do not collect a user’s web search history across third party websites or
    search engines. However, if a user navigates to our website via a web search,
    their web browser may automatically provide us with the web search term they
    used in order to find our website. Our website does not honor "do not track"
    signals transmitted by users' web browsers, so we encourage you to visit
    these links if you would like to opt out of certain tracking:
    http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices or
    http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. If you do want to opt out using these tools,
    you need to opt out separately for each of your devices and for each web
    browser you use (such as Internet Explorer®, Firefox® or Safari®) on each
    device.
</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Third Parties:</span> We may use a variety of third-party service providers, such as
    analytics companies, to understand usage of our services. We may allow
    those providers to place and read their own cookies, electronic images known
    as web beacons or single-pixel gifs and similar technologies, to help us
    measure how users interact with our services. This technical information is
    collected directly and automatically by these third parties. If you want to opt
    out of third party cookies, you may do so through your browser, as mentioned
    above in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Information collected automatically.</span>
</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Information collected when using GMetrix:</span> School and District licenses use
    the individual accounts system, called GMetrix SMS, which allows students
    and their teachers to keep track of learning. Student and teacher accounts are
    organized by classrooms created by the teachers of the subscribing school.
    For these accounts, we ask the teachers to enter the first and last name of
    students and teachers, their username, the school they are associated with
    and a security question for resetting their password. We also require the
    teachers' email for password recovery and for contacting them on support and
    service-related announcements. The only Personally Identifiable Information
    collected about students is their first name, last name, email (optional), and
    the students’ work under the account (student records). We store the data
    created in each student account ("Student Records"), such as the history of
    GMetrix tests and activities they've completed. We do so for the purpose of
    enhancing teachers’ and students’ use of the website.rvices. We will always provide an option to opt out of such
    communications.
</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Emails received from users:</span> We may retain certain information from users
    when they send us messages through our system or by email. We only use
    such information for providing the services or support requested.
</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Feedback:</span> Certain features we offer include an option to provide us with
    feedback on your experience. The feedback feature does not identify the user
    submitting it. The feedback option is voluntary and the information a user
    submits to us will only be used for improving these features. If we receive
    personally identifiable information through a feedback form we take steps to
    immediately delete that information.
</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Information collected when using a GMetrix mobile app:</span> Your website
    subscription may also provide access to the Full Access level of our mobile
    apps. If you choose to download any such app and log into it with your
    website subscription username and password, we collect limited usage
    information in connection with user logins in order to monitor subscription
    compliance. This information is maintained in accordance to this policy. We do
    not collect Personally Identifiable Information from users of the various
    GMetrix applications. If you subscribe to a GMetrix app with an in-app
    purchase subscription, we do not collect any user information.
</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    Push Notifications on mobile apps: We send you push notifications on GMetrix
    mobile apps from time to time in order to update you about any events or
    promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these
    types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure

<p class="legendp">We Do NOT Collect Or Use Information As Follows:</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    • Other than in the places and for the purposes explicitly disclosed in this
    Policy, we do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information
    directly from users under the age of 13. If we learn that we have
    inadvertently collected any Personally Identifiable Information from a
    user under 13, we will take steps to promptly delete it. Please contact us
    at info@gmetrix.com if you believe we have inadvertently collected
    Personally Identifiable Information from a user under 13.
</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    • We do not collect, use or share Personally Identifiable Information other
    than as described in our privacy policy, or with the consent of a parent
    or legal guardian as authorized by law, or otherwise as directed by an
    applicable district or school or required by contract or by law.
</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    • In no event shall we use, share or sell any Personally Identifiable
    Information for advertising or marketing purposes.
</p>




<p class="legendp">COPPA Compliance</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    Parents and legal guardians of children under 13 who use any of the GMetrix
    products have certain rights under the Children's Online Privacy Protection
    Act (COPPA), and GMetrix recognizes those rights. Parents/guardians can
    consent to collection and use of a child's personally-identifying information
    without consenting to the disclosure of information to third parties.
</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    A child's participation or access to an activity on GMetrix cannot be
    conditioned on him or her providing more information than is reasonably
    necessary for that activity, or any personally-identifying information. GMetrix
    does not collect personally-identifying information from children under 13,
    without a parent or guardian's consent or school if applicable.
</p>



<hr>

<h1 style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: bold;">Using GMetrix</h1>



<p class="ppBody">
    Schools or districts using GMetrix maintain ownership of their Student
    Records.
</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    Each school or district has access to a user-friendly administrator dashboard
    that allows direct control over the Student Records at all times. The
    administrator can create, update, review, modify and deactivate individual
    accounts, and monitor logins in the individual accounts. "Administrators" are
    only those individuals explicitly designated by the school or the district.
    Schools and districts are required to appoint an administrator that will be
    responsible for the Student Records. Districts and schools are urged to
    safeguard the administrator's access information and keep it in strict
    confidence, and notify us of any unauthorized use of password or account
    registered under their subscription.
</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    The teachers using GMetrix will only be able to access or use GMetrix with an
    administrator login provided by their school or GMetrix. Students will only be
    able to create or access their teacher's class with an Access Code provided
    by their teachers. Students will be able to store their activities, tests, and
    results with their teachers on their individual accounts. Students can only
    interact with teachers who created the GMetrix class.
</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    We encourage schools and districts using GMetrix to notify parents that the
    product is used in their school. Parents can log into their children's accounts
    and access their records. If you are a parent or guardian of a student using
    GMetrix with his or her school, you can request the login information from your
    child or their teacher. You are encouraged to use the student's login
    information and view all their activities and progress on the account at any
    time. Parents have a right to request the student's Personally Identifiable
    Information be deleted or request changes in his or her records if it is
    inaccurate or misleading by contacting the school or teacher or GMetrix
    at info@GMetrix.com. Parents may also refuse to allow GMetrix to collect
    further information from their children by contacting us at info@GMetrix.com.
</p>



<p class="legendp">FERPA Compliance</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    We understand the obligation educational agencies, districts and school
    systems have to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
    (FERPA) and we support schools in their compliance efforts and facilitate their
    alignment with FERPA.
    Under the terms of our contracts with schools, we agree to act as a "School
    Official" as defined by FERPA, meaning that we:
</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    • Perform an institutional service or function for which the school or
    district would otherwise use its own employees;
</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    • Have been determined to meet the criteria set forth in the school's or
    district's annual notification of FERPA rights for being a School Official
    with a legitimate educational interest in the education records;
</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    • Are under the direct control of the school or district with regard to the
    use and maintenance of education records;
</p>
<p class="ppBody">
    • Use education records only for authorized purposes and will not re-
    disclose Personally Identifiable Information from education records to
    other parties (unless we have specific authorization from the school or
    district to do so and it is otherwise permitted by FERPA).
</p>



<p class="legendp">How Long We Retain Student Data Information</p>

<p class="ppBody">
    Districts and schools are able to delete student identifiable information at any
    time using the Administrator Dashboard as mentioned above. Once
    information is deleted, we do not retain any copies.
</p>

<hr>

<h1 style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: bold;">How We Share Your Information</h1>



<p class="ppBody">
    We may provide Personally Identifiable Information to our partners, business
    affiliates and third party service providers who work for GMetrix and operate
    some of its functionalities, such as hosting services, streaming services and
    credit card processing. These third parties are well-known, established service
    providers, who are bound contractually to practice adequate security
    measures and only use your information for the sole purpose of providing the
    services. These third parties do not have an independent right to share your
    Personally Identifiable Information. We share Anonymous Information or De-
    Identified Information about our users for tracking analytical information when
    using third party web analytical tools. We may use or share Anonymous
    Information or De-Identified Information for educational research purposes, to
    evaluate the educational benefit of using our services or to improve our
    services.
</p>

<p class="ppBody" style="font-weight: bold;">
    We will NOT share any information for marketing or advertising
    purposes.
</p>
<p class="ppBody">
    We reserve the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information if we are
    required to do so by law or if we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect
    our rights, protect your safety or the safety or others, investigate fraud and/or
    comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena or legal process.
</p>
<p class="ppBody">
    We also reserve the right to transfer your Personally Identifiable Information in
    case of a corporate restructuring (such as a merger or acquisition), as long as
    the receiving entity adopts this privacy policy that applies to your information.
</p>

<hr>

<h1 style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: bold;">How We Store And Process Your Information</h1>



<p class="ppBody">
    We strive to maintain security policies and procedures that are designed to
    protect your information.
</p>
<p class="ppBody">
    Our servers are located in a secured, locked and monitored environment to
    prevent unauthorized entry or theft, and are protected by a firewall. The
    servers are located in a data center in the United States and backed up daily
    to a secure, "US-based," offsite data center.
</p>
<p class="ppBody">
    We take extra measures to ensure the safety of PII and Student Records and
    apply a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL or HTTPS) encrypting technology to
    establish and ensure that all data passed between the server and the browser
    remains encrypted.
</p>
<p class="ppBody">
    Governance policies and access controls are in place to ensure that the
    information of each district or school or other subscriber is separated and they
    are only able to access their own data.
</p>
<p class="ppBody">
    Only limited GMetrix personnel have access to the database, and they only
    access the database when necessary to provide services. Personnel with
    access to Student Records pass criminal background checks and periodic
    privacy training.
</p>
<p class="ppBody">
    While we strive to maintain best industry-standard privacy and security
    practices, it should be noted that no industry system is fail proof. In the event
    we learn of an actual data breach, loss or disaster, we have established a
    Disaster Recovery Plan, which includes notifying the affected subscriber, and
    as appropriate, coordinating with the subscriber to support its notification of
    affected individuals, students and families when there is a substantial risk of
    harm from the breach or a legal duty to provide notification.
</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: bold;">Links To Third-Party Sites</h1>



<p class="ppBody">
    We carefully choose our business partners and associate only with reliable
    partners who demonstrate a commitment to users' privacy and who share our
    commitment to education.
