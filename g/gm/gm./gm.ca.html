As such, GM Canada is not responsible for their compliance with applicable law.  We recommend   that you review the privacy practices of the GM Canada Dealer with whom you are dealing to ensure that you understand their   privacy practices and procedures.  Additionally, because the GM Dealer often is the first contact with you, the customer,   the Dealer can answer any questions you may have about its privacy practices.  When completing a purchase or lease agreement   or signing a Service Repair Order with the GM Dealer you should be provided with information describing the Dealership's privacy   practices and related statements that explain that certain personal information that you provide to the Dealer may be shared   with GM Canada, its dealers and its affiliates for some or all of the purposes described in this policy such as financing,   service and warranty administration, customer communication, marketing purposes and to permit us to customize and improve   your experience with GM Canada and the services and products that we offer to you.   			</p><!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?--><p><strong><a name="update">WILL GM CANADA UPDATE ITS PRIVACY POLICY?</a>      				</strong>   			</p><!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?--><p>   				We are always looking for ways to improve and update our Web site to further enhance its effectiveness.
