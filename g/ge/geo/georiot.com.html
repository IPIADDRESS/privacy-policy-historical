        <h1 align="center">Your Privacy Rights for GeoRiot </h1>
         <span class="rule"></span>
       
        
<p>This Privacy Policy will govern your use of the GeoRiot website as well as any of its related Services (“GeoRiot”, “Glob.ly”, “Site”, “Services”, “us”, “we”) which is provided by GeoRiot, LLC. &nbsp;GeoRiot provides online tools and services that implement specialized links into your website or mobile application (“property”) that direct users of that link through specialized links connected with advertisers and affiliate networks. </p>
<p><strong>What This Privacy Policy Covers</strong></p>
<p>As a provider of online tools, we understand how you may be concerned with how we operate. This is why we provide this transparent, plain English, easy-to-read Privacy Policy.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy only applies to our Site and the related GeoRiot Services.&nbsp; Some of the third parties utilized by our Service may also use, collect, and share information for many purposes on their sites and we are not responsible for any of the information that may be collected or used by them.</p>
<p>Your use of GeoRiot, such as access to data and use of the Services, is governed by this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time by us, and your continued use of the Site and Services is consideration for having read and agreed to this.&nbsp; If you do not agree with any of the terms of this agreement you must immediately terminate your participation and notify us of your intentions so that we can take appropriate action to delete any data.&nbsp; By using, visiting, registering, or interacting, or continuing to use this Site you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You must be at least 18 years of age or older to use the GeoRiot Site and Service, although the third parties who use our Service ultimately may be under 18.&nbsp; If you are under the age of 18, please do not attempt to register for the Site or provide any personal information to us.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Key Principles</strong></p>
<p>This is a brief summary of what you will be reading in this Privacy Policy:</p>
<p>There are two classes of information that we collect: (a) information about those who use our Site; and (b) the information collected through the GeoRiot Service and the people who interact with any links associated with the GeoRiot service.</p>
<p>This information is transmitted to, held and processed by our servers which may not be in the same state or country that you are in, so you consent to this transfer. </p>
<p>We typically use this information to provide you with information about us, to deliver our Services, and to produce reports and data related to our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Information That We Collect and How it is Used. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal Information</strong> - By registering for the GeoRiot Site and Service you may be providing personal information to us.&nbsp; This information may, but is not limited to, your name, email, address, website, and telephone number.&nbsp; Some of your information we may also store in Salesforce and use it to contact you about our Site and Service.&nbsp; Your use may also allow you to provide us with information as you interact with the Site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the above, our Service collects three specific kinds of data in association with our Service: </p>
<p><strong><em>Account Data</em></strong>:&nbsp; this is a GeoRiot user’s affiliate tracking information that is supplied to us.&nbsp; We use this information to contact you about our Site and Service, operate our Site and Service, and enhance your experience.</p>
<p><strong><em>Analytical Click Data</em></strong>:&nbsp; this information is collected whenever someone clicks on your links and is used to provide you with the activity that occurred by the person who clicked your link. The type of information that is collected may include, but is not limited to, http request info, information from the link, as well as sales and commission data provided by affiliate networks.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><em>Click Data Metrics</em></strong>:&nbsp; We may compile and collect metrics about the information that we collect, however it is in an anonymous form.&nbsp; This information is aggregated and helps us to enhance user experiences, and create benchmarks.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The GeoRiot Site and Service also provides a consolidated reporting platform for monitoring traffic, clicks, sales, and commissions.&nbsp; As such, our users will have access to certain information on our dashboard. </p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>We use Google Adsense on our Site, which may utilize DoubleClick dART cookies.&nbsp; These cookies are maintained by Google and are governed by their own Privacy Policy.&nbsp; These cookies may collect information about you, but on a limited basis, and may be used to serve relevant ads to you.&nbsp; We are not connected with any of the advertisements that you may be shown from Adsense and you can choose to disable these types of cookies in your browser.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected by our ISP</strong></p>
<p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to help us manage our servers, databases, and analytics. These third parties may have access to your information only to perform those tasks, and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.&nbsp; The hosting provider for this Site has the ability to record various pieces of information, including domain name, pages accessed, date and time of access, web browser type and computer operating system, and referring information.&nbsp; This information is stored in our server log and may be accessible to us from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>Release of Information for Legal Reasons.</strong></p>
<p>We may release information when we believe it is necessary or appropriate to comply with the law (for example, pursuant to a statutory demand, subpoena, warrant or court order), to protect against fraudulent, abusive or unlawful use of the Site or Service, to protect our rights or property, enforce any contract between you and us, or if we reasonably believe that a situation involving danger of death or injury to any person requires disclosure. </p>
<p><strong>Transfer of Information.</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer your information in the event of a change in entity structure, or acquisition of substantial portion of the assets of our company or its parent company.&nbsp; In such event, we will notify you when the information is transferred and the privacy policy changes.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Change or Remove Information</strong></p>
<p>Users may be able to review and edit some of the personal information they have provided to us by logging into their account on the Site and editing the account.&nbsp; Although most changes may occur immediately, information may still be stored in a web browser’s cache.&nbsp; We take no responsibility for stored information in your cache, or in other devices that may store information, and disclaim all liability of such.&nbsp; In addition, we may, from time to time, retain residual information about you in our backup and/or database.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If a user wishes to have their information updated or removed from our CRM (Salesforce) please contact <a href="mailto:contact@georiot.com">contact@georiot.com</a> with the request.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other Terms</strong></p>
<p><strong>Spam</strong></p>
<p>By providing information to the Site that forms the basis of communication with you, such as contact information, you waive all rights to file complaints concerning unsolicited email or spam from this website since, by providing such information, you agree to receive communication from us and anyone else covered under this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; However, you may unsubscribe from certain communications via the website or by notifying the Site that you no longer wish to receive solicitations or information and we will endeavor to remove you from the database.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Use</strong></p>
<p>Although we do not intend to sell, share, or rent information obtained on the Site other than as discussed in this privacy policy we reserve the right to do so in the future.&nbsp; If we do, we will update this Privacy Policy to reflect those definitive changes. </p>
<p><strong>Data Security and Risks Inherent with Information Sharing</strong></p>
<p>GeoRiot takes reasonable measures to protect the security of your personal information, your usage of the Service, and your usage of the Site. We take reasonable precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.&nbsp; However, you understand and agree that the purpose of the Site is to facilitate the exchange of information with us and other third parties, and, as a consideration for viewing, communicating with, or using the Site in any manner, including placing GeoRiot links on your site, you waive all claims of any nature against us and our owners, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives concerning the loss, alteration, or misuse of information.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In essence, what we’re trying to say is that no security measures are perfect.&nbsp; There is no guarantee that any information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by any breach of any physical, technical, or other safeguards.&nbsp; Nor can we guarantee that any information that you share on the Site or with other users will not become publicly available.&nbsp; You assume all responsibility and liability for, and agree to hold us and our owners, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives harmless for the use or misuse your personal data, including the use of such data by others that use such information in an inappropriate way or that may cause you harm.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Changes in This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we may post those changes on the Site so you can remain aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.&nbsp; Your continued use of this Site and the Program is consideration for your acceptance of any changes to the Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Minors - COPPA</strong></p>
<p>Individuals under 13 years of age are not allowed to use our Site or Service. If you are under the legal age of 13 years old do not apply for or submit any personal information to this Site or our Service.&nbsp; Do not use our Service to collect information about people under the age of 13 unless you have proper permission and disclosures in place. If you are under the age of 13 years old, cease use of this website immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Advertiser and Third Party Websites</strong></p>
<p>Please be aware that this Privacy Policy, and any other policies in place, in addition to any amendments, does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to members of the Service or Site.&nbsp; GeoRiot, LLC bears no responsibility for the information collected or used by any advertiser or third party website. Please review the privacy policy and terms of service for each site you visit through third party links.</p>
<p><strong>International Transfer</strong></p>
<p>Your information may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, GeoRiot transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Note to California Residents (Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003 - OPPA)</strong></p>
<p>It is the intent of the GeoRiot to comply with the California Business and Professions Code §§ 22575-22579.&nbsp; If you are a California resident you may request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; Various provisions throughout this Privacy Policy address requirements of the act. In summary, you must presume that we collect electronic information from all visitors.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@georiot.com">contact@georiot.com</a> with any questions. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy was lasted updated on April 21, 2012.&nbsp; This privacy policy applies to the Site, Service and any subdomains of the Site.
