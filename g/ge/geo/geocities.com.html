<b>Dear Community Members,</b>
<p>

GeoCities provides interactive environments on the Internet to enable and encourage members to express themselves and share their interests by creating diverse, high-quality content within themed virtual communities.
</p><p>

The resulting high traffic, the passionate involvement of our members and our expertise in building and managing these communities enable the company to offer a broad range of commercial services.
</p><p>

GeoCities is an amazing place. More than a million people from all six livable continents, and over 200 countries have taken up residence in one of our neighborhoods.  In addition to having over 1.6 million members, we receive over 90 million visits a month by 9 million unique visitors, and are one of the five most visited sites on the Internet.  We respect our position a leader in the Internet industry and our responsibility to set examples that will frame the standards for others on the Web.
</p><p>

GeoCities has been fortunate to attract major advertisers and sponsors who are primarily responsible for allowing us to provide all of the services and features we offer and will offer in the future. We understand, and our sponsors understand, that our success and their success are dependent on the goodwill of our homesteaders and visitors.
</p><p>

To promote trust and confidence in the Internet and in GeoCities, we are providing a full disclosure of our privacy practices and information uses.  We encourage all other Internet organizations to do the same and/or to endorse and use our Statement on Privacy.
</p><p>

One of our main goals at GeoCities is to respect the privacy rights of anyone who joins GeoCities or visits any of our neighborhoods.  Except as set forth within this privacy statement and within the scope of our community and content guidelines, we will never release personally identifiable information about our individual members and visitors without their permission.
</p><p>

Our view is that our members and users are the ones who should generally control whether or not they share any personal information and how that information is used if it is shared. Furthermore, we believe that it is our responsibility to provide something of value in exchange for any information shared - in our case, free personal home pages, e-mail, chat rooms and other free services.
</p><p>

Furthermore, we actively support various Web and industry efforts to establish policies and standards in the areas of cookies, user information and privacy.
</p><p>

We appreciate your interest in and support of GeoCities and pledge to you our continued support in building the "Societies of the New Frontier."
</p></a><p><a name="intro">

For information about how to contact GeoCities about technical problems, to report a violation of our guidelines, advertising within our domain, or any other item of interest or concern, please visit our Contact Page: </a><a href="http://www.geocities.com/main/contact/"> http://www.geocities.com/main/contact/</a>.
</p><p>

GeoCities respects the privacy of all those who spend any amount of time in our communities.  We do collect information from our members and visitors.  This is a statement of the use of the information that we collect, and if or how any of it is disseminated.

<li><b>  What information do we compile and use?  And what methods do we use to collect information?
</b><p>

</p><dd>    We give notice to everyone prior to collecting any personally identifiable information.  Such personally identifiable information will be used only for the purposes stated at the time of collection, and within this Web document.
<p>

GeoCities does not share any personally identifiable information with outside parties for commercial purposes, unless stated at the time of collection.  The option is given, at the time of collection, not to allow GeoCities to share such information with outside parties.  If such an option is taken, we will not share such information with outside parties; however, we do reserve the right to release that information concerning a member, when the member partakes in an illegal activity, or for a member who we believe is in violation of our content guidelines, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order.  GeoCities hopes that all third parties involved adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our members; however, GeoCities does not assume any responsibility for any actions of third parties.
</p><p>

For everyone who visits the GeoCities domain, we log IP addresses, the type of operating system that the visitor's computer uses, and the type of browser software used by the visitor.  From the IP address, we can determine the Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of the visitor's point of connectivity.
</p><p>

We use the aggregate data we collect to perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our members and visitors, to measure overall patron demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the GeoCities domain and to analyze how and where to use our resources. We also use the aggregate data collected, to inform our sponsors as to numbers of people who have seen and "clicked" on their advertisement.  We also use cookies to help us determine how long users view particular content, what particular content (e.g. advertising) users view, what content or sites users link to, and what GeoCities services members and visitors use.
</p><p>

Currently, GeoCities is using cookies, and, as with all online companies who do, we are continuously evaluating our use of this information.  As we have previously stated, we actively support various Web and industry efforts to establish policies and standards in the areas of cookies, user information and privacy.

<a name="cookies">
<li><b> What are cookies and what are you using them for? </b><br>
<dd> A "cookie" is a file transferred from a website to the hard drive of your computer so that the website can track your activities on the website.  A cookie will not let a website know any personally identifying information about you, such as your real name, address, etc., unless you previously provided that information at the website or have set your preferences in your browser to provide that information.  GeoCities is not generally interested in any one individual and does not collect personally identifiable information about any one person using cookies.  The coding in the cookies we set lets us know that you are a particular user, but nothing more.  We may, in the future, use cookies to help personalize GeoCities for individual members so that it will seem even more like "Your Home on the Web."
<p>

Cookies are a way for us to track who has seen which pages on our site, who has seen which ads, how often some pages are visited, and what the most popular areas of GeoCities are.

</p><p>

</p><li><b>  Why do we need this information? </b><br>
<dd>    GeoCities uses cookies in order to help serve you better.  Without cookies it would be difficult for GeoCities to know that certain neighborhoods are more popular than others.  This information helps us to better understand when to open up new neighborhoods or suburbs of existing neighborhoods.  Cookies also help us know whether or not users have seen particular banners, including advertising, so we don't bore you with the same advertisement over and over again.
<p>

Do we think cookies can be annoying and a distraction? Yes, many of us within GeoCities have cookies turned off on our browsers, and if a site tries to set cookies too many times, we may get discouraged and are less likely to return.  In this, we are assuming that most people who visit GeoCities feel the same way we do.

</p><p>

</p><li><b>  Do we have to use cookies to determine this information?
</b><br>
<dd>    To date, cookies are the most effective method of collecting the data that is helpful to GeoCities.   Are we concerned about a negative backlash from our members and visitors if we use cookies? Absolutely, and if it turns out that we can't find a way to make this work, then we'll have to look at some other alternative.

The bottom line is that, with the help of our members and visitors, we think that we will find ways to address the issues involved with the usage of cookies and a lot of other issues within our communities. GeoCities is constantly evolving, and is never finished. We value kindness, friendship and helping people.  With your help and the help of your fellow homesteaders, we'll develop community policies and procedures that keep this whole community growing and thriving.
<p>

We do not monitor the use of e-mail accounts, unless prompted by a request from a legal authority or in instances in which the activities of the user is interfering in the daily operation of GeoCities.  We do use the information provided in the registration process as we have set forth within this privacy statement and within the scope of our community and content guidelines.
</p><p>

In our chat rooms, we do collect all logins and dialogue. The logs are kept for an indeterminate amount of time.  We do not perform any analysis of this information.
</p><p>

We do not collect any e-mail addresses of those who communicate with GeoCities via e-mail.  We only use the information provided so that we may respond to the e-mail.
</p><p>

When GeoCities sponsors promotions or sweepstakes, it will post privacy information contained in the rules and /or login area for the promotion or sweepstakes, which, to the extent it conflicts with this statement, will govern that particular promotion or sweepstakes. Anyone else conducting promotions or sweepstakes within GeoCities must adhere to our privacy statement and divulge how any information collected will be used.  We do not allow our homesteaders to use GeoCities for the purpose of gathering personally identifiable information for commercial or unlawful purposes.
</p><p>

GeoCities does not control the acts of its members and visitors.  All members and visitors should be aware that, when they disclose personal information such as their actual name, member name, e-mail address, etc., on their webpage, in a newsgroup, guestbook, chat room or forum, the information may be collected and used by others  to send that person unsolicited e-mail from other parties, outside GeoCities.

</p></a><dd><a name="howdowe">    During the registration process for GeoCities membership, an individual is presented with the choice of whether or not to receive promotional information from GeoCities or our sponsors.  For those who elect to receive promotional materials from GeoCities or third parties, and who indicate that they do in their profile, we do release personally identifiable information.  Information released includes: real name, street address, e-mail address, interests, GeoCities neighborhood, and the 
broader personal information (e.g., level of education, occupation and marital status) supplied in the GeoCities registration and personal profile.  If the member is under the age of 13, we will not release any personally identifiable information, even if the child indicates on his or her registration or personal profile that he or she would like to receive such information.
<p>

GeoCities limits the sending or e-mail solicitations to members who have requested this type of information/communication.  Such solicitations are limited in that they, among other things, must clearly indicate who the originator of the e-mail is, and provide the member with a method of opting out from receiving future communications.
</p></a><p><a name="howdowe">

If you are receiving e-mail from a third party who states that it is specifically associated with GeoCities, yet you indicated on your registration or profile editor that you did not want to receive promotional material from GeoCities or its sponsors, please first attempt to follow the third party's removal procedures.  Then verify that your personal profile is correct.  If it is incorrect or does indeed indicate that you chose to not receive the e-mail, please contact us at:
</a><a href="mailto:geoprivacy@geocities.com">geoprivacy@geocities.com</a>, and we will promptly investigate why this error occurred.
</p><p>

GeoCities does not sell or lease personally identifiable information regarding GeoCities homesteaders who elect in their registration form or on their personal profile not to receive promotional materials from third parties.
</p><p>

GeoCities encourages all third parties involved to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our members, but GeoCities does not assume any responsibility for any actions of third parties.
</p><p>

If, at any time, you decide that you would like to change your indication of whether to receive or not to receive promotional information from GeoCities or its sponsors, you need only change your personal profile to indicate your choice:
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/members/tools/profile_editor.html"> http://www.geocities.com/members/tools/profile_editor.html</a>
</p><p>

We respond to subpoenas, warrants, or other court orders regarding information that is contained within our access logs, concerning any member or visitor. We also reserve the right to release that information concerning a member who we believe is in violation of our content guidelines, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order.  We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our servers for illegal activities.  We also reserve the right to report any illegal activity to law enforcement for prosecution.

<b> What information do we collect on those who are children?  How do we try to ensure the privacy of our child members?

</p><dd>    GeoCities believes that it is particularly important to protect the privacy of children online.  In fact, we created a children's neighborhood for the sole purpose of allowing children their own special dimension within the adult world.  In furtherance of that purpose, we created additional guidelines to keep our
"EnchantedForest" child oriented.
<p>
note:<i> GeoCities currently defines children to mean minors under the age of 13 years old.</i>
</p><p>
All information collected from children is used only for purposes of statistical analysis, editorial participation, feedback, and those purposes described in the registration process.  No information obtained from children will be passed on to third parties, regardless of whether he or she chooses for GeoCities to disseminate his or her personal information for promotional opportunities. This includes information obtained during the registration process for membership or enrollment for special contests/promotional opportunities on our site.

We encourage children prior and during the registration process to include their parents in the registration process, and for the parents to read our privacy statement prior to registering.</p></dd></a></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

<b> In which ways may I protect my privacy on the Internet and within GeoCities?

</p><li><b>Know the risks.</b><br>
When you communicate with others online, you should be aware that, when disclosing personal information such as one's actual name, member name, e-mail address, etc., on a webpage, in a newsgroup, chat room or forum, that information may be collected and used by others to send that person unsolicited e-mail from other parties, outside GeoCities.   Some of the e-mail you receive may be useful to you, but some may not be.  GeoCities cannot prevent information gathering robots called "harvesters" from traversing our domain, but in an effort to curtail unsolicited e-mail, we do block certain e-mail addresses and domains from sending e-mail to e-mail addresses at our domain.
<p>
You should also be aware that, although GeoCities respects the privacy of your e-mail messages, it makes no representation, warranties or commitments concerning our ability to keep your e-mail messages private.
</p><p>
</p></li></a><li><a name="protect"><b>Educate yourself.</b><br>
Search the Web for as much information as you can about how to protect your privacy.  Look for a privacy statement in the sites you visit.  Some places to start include: <br>

<p>

</p><li><b>Tell your children:  "Never talk to strangers!" </b><br>
Tell them to not give out their names or other personal information. They should also be instructed not to fill out any forms or register at any domain without your knowledge and consent.
<p>

</p></li><li><b>Use PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)<a href="http://www.pgp.com">http://www.pgp.com</a> or another encryption program.</b>
<p>

</p></li><li><b>Understand the relative ease involved in cracking a password.</b><br>
Recognize, too, the necessity of inconvenience when passwords are involved, such as when you have to enter passwords with weird characters with those very long and awkward keystroke combinations.

"Hackers pose a real threat to everyone.  Using programs that continually guess at user names and password combinations, hackers can literally search 24 hours a day to get what they want. If a password is made up of eight characters using only lowercase letters of the alphabet, that limits the search to just 208 billion possibilities. Sound astronomical? It's not. At 100,000 guesses per second, the most rudimentary hacking program can crack this kind of password in about three weeks.
<p>

But suppose that eight character password were made up of both upper- and lowercase letters, and included numerals and other special characters (like the dollar  sign or ampersand). The possibilities for an eight character password would soar to 722 trillion. And the time it takes to crack them:
229 years!"
