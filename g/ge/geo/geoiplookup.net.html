<h1>Privacy Policy</h1> 
<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on every page of our site.</p>      
<h2>The Way We Use Information</h2>
<p>We use email addresses to confirm registration upon the creation of a new account.</p>
<p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.</p>
<p>On occasion we may send email to addresses of registered users to inform them about changes or new features added to our site.</p>
<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.</p>
<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">Our Commitment To Data Security</h2>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>
<h2>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</h2>
<p>GeoIPLookup.net expects its partners, advertisers and third-party affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. However, third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a GeoIPLookup.net page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party.

GeoIPLookup.net is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>
<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before.

Should you choose to voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on our site, such as in message boards, chat areas or in advertising or notices you post, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of GeoIPLookup.net and this policy.</p>
