          with you, such as to notify you about updates to our products and services, 
          or to assist you with any questions you may have about an order you 
          have placed for products and services. From time to time, we may use

          a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency's request. ORBIMAGE's 
          agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information 
          are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent
