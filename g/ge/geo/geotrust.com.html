					<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
					
					<p>GeoTrust, Inc. is committed to protecting personally-identifiable  information that we handle in the course of providing our certification  and authentication-related services ("Personal Information"). This  Privacy Policy describes our information-handling practices. This  Privacy Policy applies only to information relating to those GeoTrust's  services (the "Services") that are provided via the www.geotrust.com,  www.trustwatch.com, and www.rapidssl.com public Internet web sites (the  "Web Sites"), as described in the applicable Certificate Policy  Statement, and does not apply to GeoTrust's corporate parents or  affiliates or to any information collected or maintained for other  purposes. This policy describes: </p>
					<ul>
					<li>What Personal Information we collect in offering and providing the Services; </li>
					<li>How we use and to whom we disclose Personal Information; </li>
					<li>Your choices concerning our uses of Personal Information; </li>
					<li>The security measures we use to protect Personal Information; </li>
					<li>Your rights to correct and update Personal Information; and </li>
					<li>How you can contact us about Personal Information. </li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Information Collection &amp; Use</h4>
					<p>					      GeoTrust is the sole owner of the Personal Information collected through our Web Sites or in connection with the Services. </p>
					<h5>Data Collected from non-Registered Users </h5>
					<p>					      You may visit the Web Sites without providing any Personal Information.
					</p>
					<h5>
					Data Collected from Registered Users </h5>
					<p>					      We need to collect Personal Information such as name, phone  number, email address, state, and country in order for you to register  for Services or to respond to your requests for information that you  may submit to us through the Web Site. We use this information to  process your requests, to administer the Services in which you have  expressed interest, and to provide information to you relating to our  Services. You may have the option to provide additional demographic  information (such as job title, corporation affiliation, geographic  location, or other data) through the Web Sites. We use this information  to analyze interest in the Web Site and to improve the information we  make available through the Web Sites. </p>
					<p>
					We may send periodic email updates to registered users, providing  information about related products or services. We provide the option  not to receive these types of communications, as described below under  "Choice and Opt-out." This paragraph applies to users of our TrustWatch  service: Your Personal Information may be used in accordance with the  applicable TrustWatch Toolbar License Agreement . Certain information  including your IP address and information about the sites you visit  will be transmitted to Alexa Internet, Inc., which will then become  subject to Alexa's privacy policy  (http://pages.alexa.com/help/privacy.html). Alexa aggregates and  analyzes the information it collects to improve its web traffic  analysis services and to prepare non-identifiable reports about  aggregate web usage. </p>
					<h4>Data Collected through Referrals </h4>
					<p>
					We provide a mechanism for you to refer other persons whom you believe  may be interested in our Services. In such cases, we will send the  referral a one-time email inviting him or her to visit our Web Site. We  maintain this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time  email and for tracking the success of our referral program, but will  not send further unsolicited communications. </p>
					<p>
					We engage third party services such as TechTarget and KnowledgeStorm to  identify potential users of our Services. These services employ their  own mechanisms to enable individuals to opt out of email distribution  lists. </p>
					<h4>External Links </h4>
					<p>
					Our Web Site may contain links to other sites that are not owned or  controlled by GeoTrust. Please be aware that we are not responsible for  the privacy practices of such other sites that you may access from our  Web Site. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to  read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects  personally identifiable information. </p>
					<h5>Automated Web Site Tracking  
					</h5>
					<p>
					When you visit one of our Web Sites, statistics about your visit are  automatically collected. This information does not identify you  personally, but rather identifies information about a visit to the Web  Site. This information may include how many people visit the Web Site,  the user's Internet Protocol (IP) address, which pages are visited,  from which domains our visitors come and which types of browsers these  persons use. We use these statistics about your visit for aggregate,  analytical purposes only, to help us improve the performance and  effectiveness of our Web Site. We retain third party service providers,  such as WebTrends (http://www.webtrends.com/), to provide these  statistical analysis services. The techniques for collecting this  information are described below: 
					</p>
					<h5>
					Log Files 
					</h5>
					<p>
					We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes IP addresses, browser type, internet service  provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time  stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not  identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site,  to track users' movements around the Web Site and to gather demographic  information about our user community. Unless we separately notify you,  we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal  Information.
					</p>
					<h5>Cookies</h5>
					<p>
					A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for  record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on our Web Sites. We do/do not  link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information  you submit through our Web Sites. We use both session cookies and  permanent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close you browser.  A permanent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of  time. You may decline to accept cookies or may remove permanent cookies  by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help"  file. <br>
					<br>
					We use temporary cookies to help your browser navigate our Web Site, to  determine which visitors reach our Web Site from sites of our business  partners, and to record during a user's session that the user is  properly authenticated. We use permanent cookies to recall your  information to save you time in filling out forms and/or revisiting our  Web Site and to determine which visitors to our Web Sites have visited  them before and if so, for what purposes. <br>
					<br>
					If you reject cookies, you may still generally access the informational  material on our Web Sites, but you may be unable to obtain some of our  Services or access some portions of our Web Sites. <br>
					</p>
					<h5>Certificate Application Information</h5>
					<p>
					In order to issue digital certificates and provide our Services, we  must collect and maintain Personal Information about prospective  Certificate Holders. Our information requirements may vary according to  the type of Service being requested, as provided in the applicable  service agreements, enrollment forms, and/or certificate applications.  This information may include name; corporate affiliation; job title;  postal address; telephone numbers; email address; gender; date of  birth; dates of employment; and driver's license, passport or other  government-issued identification documents numbers. We use this  information to document and verify the identities or persons to whom we  issue certificates or provide Services. We require documentation  establishing that certificate applicants have expressly consented to  the use of their Personal Information in connection with our Services.</p>
					<h5>Subscriber Information </h5>
					<p>
					We must also collect Personal Information from officers and other  representatives of companies that subscribe to our Services and  designate authorized Certificate Holders. This information may include  name; corporate affiliation; job title; postal address; years at  address; telephone numbers; email address; state license status and  license numbers; Dun &amp; Bradstreet number; credit card and bank  account number and related billing and payment information; and IP  addresses. We use this information to administer our Services, contact  you in connection with your account, and to provide information about  the Services or other offerings that we believe may be of interest to  you. 
					</p>
					<h5>Customer Service</h5>
					<p>
					We may send Service-related announcements when we believe it is  necessary to do so. For instance, if our Service is temporarily  unavailable, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out  of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do  not wish to receive them, you may terminate any Services that you  receive from us. We will communicate with you in response to your  inquiries, to provide the Services you request, and as we determine is  necessary to manage your account. We will communicate with you by  email, telephone, or postal mail, depending upon the nature and urgency  of the matter. <br>
					<br>
					We also provide a web-based form for submitting  service-related questions to us. This form requests name, company name,  email address, and phone number. This personal information is used to  contact the submitter to respond to the service inquiry.  </p>
					<h5>Supplementation of Information </h5>
					<p>
					In order to provide the Services, we may supplement the personal  information you submitted to us with information from third party  sources. For example, we may use the WHOIS database of Internet domain  name registrants or may engage third party business information  services (such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Authentify, or ChoicePoint,  among others) to obtain verified information about subscribers, to  verify personal identification for certificate applicants, or to assess  the continued eligibility or license status of certificate holders or  subscribers. We use these sources only to verify information.</p>
					<h4>Information Sharing And Disclosure</h4>
					<h5>Aggregate Information</h5>
					<p>
					We share non-identifiable aggregated demographic information about our  user base with third parties, such as our marketing partners and  advertisers. This information does not contain Personal Information and  is not used to identify or contact individual users.</p>
					<h5>Personal Information </h5>
					<p>
					We disclose Personal Information for the following purposes:
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>To our contractors, agents, service providers, and affiliated  companies (i.e., parents and subsidiaries) for purposes of responding  to customer requests; providing requested Services; validating the  identity of subscribers and certificate applicants; maintaining and  operating our Web Sites, systems, and equipment; billing and  collection; distributing marketing and informational materials; and  internal management and administration of our business, provided that  these recipients are not permitted to use or disclose the information  for other purposes.. </li>
						<li>To other third parties, as we determine to be reasonable and  appropriate to comply with legal requirements; to obtain required  governmental authorizations; to assert or defend our legal rights,  enforce our agreements, prevent or respond to suspected fraud, or  protect the health, safety, or legal rights of others; to cooperate  with law enforcement authorities; to comply with a judicial proceeding,  court order, or legal process; or in connection with an actual or  prospective transaction involving the assets related to one or more of  the Services to which such Personal Information pertains; in the event  of such a transaction, we will announce any change in ownership or  control of your Personal Information on our Web Site before the  transfer takes effect and will provide an opportunity to decline to  permit the transfer to occur. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Without limiting the foregoing, these disclosures may include the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Providing, revoking, or renewing the Services. We may provide the  information you have submitted to us to an independent business partner  or service provider (either within or outside the United States) so  that the business partner or service provider can contact you to  provide support relating to the Services. To confirm whether any entity  is one of our authorized business partners or service providers, please  contact us at the address provided below. </li>
						<li>Facilitating supplemental services associated with a  certificate. Some certificates may come with additional third-party  services or products. In these cases, we will forward some or all of  the Personal Information in your certificate application to third party  providers so that they can provide you with the service or product and  follow up with you directly regarding their service or product. </li>
					</ul>
					<h5>Certificate Information</h5>
					<p>All information that you provide us that forms the content of a  certificate will be "published" in a repository that can be accessed by  third parties. No person should have any expectation of privacy in the  contents of a certificate.</p>
					<h5>International Data Transfer </h5>
					<p>We maintain and process Personal Information in the United  States. Accordingly, information obtained elsewhere will be transferred  to, maintained in, and processed in, and under the laws of, the United  States. By subscribing to one of our Services, you must consent to such  transfer and processing of your information in the United States.  </p>
					<h4>Choice/Opt-Out</h4>
					<p>You may inform us that you do not wish to receive communications from  us except as required in connection with Services that you request. If  you no longer wish to receive our updates and other informational  materials, you may opt out of future such communications by following  the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by  sending a written mail, email, or facsimile request as listed under  "Contact Us" below. To remove your address from our marketing and  newsletter distribution lists, please go to  https://www.geotrust.com/compref. </p>
					<p>We use permission-based third party email marketing services such as  Responsys, Vertical Response, salesforce.com, and Constant Contact,  which allow individuals to control their receipt of marketing email  messages. </p>
					<h4>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
					<p>If you wish to view the Personal Information we maintain about  you, or if your Personal Information changes, or if you wish to  terminate a certificate or the Services that you obtain from us, you  may notify us by sending a written mail, email, or facsimile request as  listed under "Contact Us" below. <br><br>Depending upon the nature of the information, we may need to verify  your identity and the requested change before providing access to  Personal Information or making a requested change in our databases. If  you request to change any information contained in a certificate, the  certificate may need to be revoked and a new certificate issued. <br><br>A certificate may be revoked or deactivated upon written  request by the Subscriber on whose behalf the certificate is issued, in  addition to the other bases for revocation provided through our  certificate policies. </p>
					<h5>Security</h5>
					<p>We consider the protection of all personal information we receive from  our Web Site visitors, Subscribers, Relying Parties, and Certificate  Holders as a core responsibility. We have security measures in place to  protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of Personal  Information. As with any transmission over the Internet, however, there  is always some element of risk involved in sending personal  information. In order to try to minimize this risk, we encrypt  information that you submit to us electronically when submitting  requests or ordering certificates. <br><br>We implement data security safeguards based upon generally accepted  industry standards to protect your Personal Information from  unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or loss. Nonetheless,  no data security techniques are 100% effective, and we cannot guarantee  its security. </p>
					<h5>"Email This Page" </h5>
					<p>If you use the "Email this page" feature to send a copy of a  Web Site page to someone else, your email address will appear as the  sender of the email. We do not track the senders and receivers of Web  Site pages in a personally-identifiable manner.  </p>
					<h5>Privacy Policy Changes</h5>
					<p>If a material change is made to this Privacy Policy and/or the way we use our customers' personally identifiable information then we will post prominent notice of the nature of such change on the first page of this Privacy Policy and also on our home page.</p>
