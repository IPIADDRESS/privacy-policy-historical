<h4>GeoTrust's 10 Privacy Principles</h4>

<p><b>1.  We collect only information that is essential to providing good service to customers and users.</b>    We limit the amount of information we gather to what we need to know to provide good service and to fulfill any legal or regulatory requirements.  </p>

<p><b>2.  We inform users about what data is collected and how it will be used.</b>     We tell customers and users about the general uses we make of information collected and will provide additional information upon request.  We do not sell, lease or license confidential information to outside parties.   We provide access to confidential information only to outside parties who are directly related to the delivery and service of our products and services.  Any access to information is always fully disclosed to all authorized parties.</p>

<p><b>3.  We allow users to choose how their self-disclosed data will be used.</b>    We provide GeoTrust business customers and product users the choice to decide how they want the information they disclose used.  We provide the choice to opt-out at any time of further use of the information. </p>

<p><b>4.  We ensure information quality.</b>   We employ advanced technologies, well-defined practices, and a highly trained technical staff to ensure that self-disclosed data is processed properly, accurately and completely.   We provide the mechanism for self-disclosed data to be corrected if errors or changes occur.   We do not guarantee the accuracy of third party data we license to use in the True Credentials<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> corporate identity, but we do facilitate the process of resolving data discrepancies. </p>

<p><b>5.  We use information security safeguards.</b>   We use advanced information security technologies and a highly trained technical staff to protect all data assets entrusted to us.  We have implemented well-defined data security and data access procedures to further ensure that data is protected from improper access, loss, misuse, or destruction.</p>

<p><b>6.  We are responsive to requests for explanation about our data use and policies.</b>    We have a Customer Service operation with representatives trained to be responsive to queries about our policies, practices, products and services.  Customer Service representatives are also trained to facilitate the process of resolving data discrepancies in third party data. </p>

<p><b>7.  We hold our employees responsible for our privacy principles.</b>     Each GeoTrust employee is personally responsible for helping to maintain public confidence in the company.  All GeoTrust employees are provided with training in the protection of data privacy and security practices, which are also included in the GeoTrust employee handbook. </p>

<p><b>8.  We provide these privacy principles to our business partners.</b>    We strongly encourage companies we select as our business partners to have privacy policies based upon accepted industry standards in the handling of self-disclosed data.  These include companies that assist us in providing service to our customers or supply us with information about enterprises or individuals.  In selecting business partners, GeoTrust considers the accuracy and quality of the data they provide and their information handling practices. We do not guarantee the accuracy of third party data we license to use in the True Credential<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> corporate identity, but we do facilitate the process of resolving data discrepancies.</p>

<p><b>9.  We comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations wherever GeoTrust does business, based upon the prevailing jurisdictional requirements.</b>  As a company
with a global reach, GeoTrust is committed to keeping up-to date on the requirements of all local,
national, and international laws and regulations applicable to our products and services. </p>
