				<p>
					<b>GemFortunes</b> has created this privacy statement in order to  demonstrate our firm and continuing commitment to the privacy of  personal information provided by those visiting and interacting with  this web site. We hold the privacy of your personal information in the  highest regard. The following discloses our information gathering and  dissemination practices for this website.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>We recognizes the importance of protecting your  privacy</b> and our policy is designed to assist you in understanding  how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide  to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our  site. This policy will be continuously assessed against new  technologies, business practices and our customers' needs. 
				</p>
				
				<h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
				<div>
					<p>When you visit this web site you may provide us with two types  of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose  that is collected on an individual basis and Web site use information  collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site. </p>
					
					<div style="margin-left:5px;">
						<p><b>Personal Information You Choose to Provide</b></p>
						
						<b>Email Information:</b> If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may  retain the content of your email messages together with your email  address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these  electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of  information received by mail and telephone. 
						
						<p>
						<b>Web Site Use Information:</b> Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes  a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What  Are Cookies?") and web server log files to collect information about how  our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web  server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed,  time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and  just after our Web site.
						</p>
					</div>	
				</div>

				<h2>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</h2>
				<div>
				<p>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of  administering our business activities, providing the products and  services you requested, to process your payment, to monitor the use of  the service, our marketing and promotional efforts and improve our  content and service offerings, and customize our site's content, layout,  services and for other lawful purposes. These uses improve our site and  better tailor it to meet your needs. </p>										

				<p>Furthermore, such information may be shared with  others on an aggregate basis. Personally identifiable information or  business information will not be shared with parties except as required  by law.</p>									

				<p>Occasionally, we may also use the information we  collect to notify you about important changes to our Website, new  services, and special offers we think you will find valuable.</p> 										

				<p>We also share your information with the individual who  referred you to this site. They may use that information to contact you  directly. In the event you wish to discontinue receiving information  from us you can simply engage the auto removal feature available at the  bottom of EVERY email we send to you. Should your sponsor contact you  outside our system you must inform them, individually, of your desire to  be removed from their mailing list. Otherwise, your information is NOT  shared with anyone else.</p>
				</div>
				
				<h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
				<div>
				<p>
					A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes  an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's  computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part  of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site  can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences  allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web  site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies  sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies.  However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the  configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have  your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site  will not function as effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie  cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer  viruses.
				</p>
				</div>

				<h2>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</h2>
				<div>
				<p>
					As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to  differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies  to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for  security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow  us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site  and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather  feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our  clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information  about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information  that your browser provided to us in your cookies.
				</p>
				</div>

				<h2>IP Addresses</h2>
				<div>
				<p>
					IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are  connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by  computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are  automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and  profile data known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages  you request) can be sent to you.
				</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Sharing and Selling Information</h2>
				<div>
				<p>
					We do not share, sell, lend or lease any of the information  that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal  details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process  transactions or provide services that you have requested. 
				</p>
				</div>

				<h2>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</h2>
				<div>
				<p>
					You may request access to all your personally identifiable  information that we collect online and maintain in our database by  emailing us at the usual address.  
				</p>
				</div>

				<h2>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of  Information?</h2>
				<div>
				<p>
					We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so,  in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it  or for the protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose account  information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this  information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action  against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect  the safety of our users and the Public. 	
				</p>
				</div>

				<h2>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</h2>
				<div>
				<p>
					We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites  linked to or from our Web site or the information or content contained  therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers  to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web  site. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to  another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your  browsing and interaction on any other web site, including web sites,  which have a link on our Website, is subject to that Web site's own  rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before  proceeding.	
				</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Your Consent</h2>
				<div>
				<p>
					By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of  your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We  reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or  without notice. 	
				</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Our Commitment To Data Security:</h2>
				<div>
				<p>
					Please note that your information will be stored and processed  on our computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal  data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your  Country of residence or citizenship. To prevent unauthorized access,  maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we  have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial  procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 	
				</p>
				</div>


				<h2>Acquisition or Changes in Ownership</h2>
				<div>
				<p>
					In the event that the web site (or a substantial portion of  its assets) is acquired, your information would be considered part of  those assets, and may be part of those assets that are transferred. 	
				</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Policy Modifications</h2>
				<div>
				<p>
					We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when  changes are made to this privacy policy, we will email users who have  given us permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure  to check back periodically. However, please be assured that if the  Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal  information you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a  manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without  your prior consent.
