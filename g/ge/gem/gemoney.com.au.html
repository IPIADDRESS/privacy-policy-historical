                                    Wherever it is possible and practical to do so, we will collect personal information directly from you, this may be in person, over the telephone, by email, over the internet, by e-mail or fax, or by completion of a form (such as an application form).
                                </p>

This will be limited to circumstances where it is impracticable or unreasonable for us to collect it directly from you. The type of third party who might provide information to us will vary depending on the nature of the business and interaction with you. For example, we may collect credit information and credit eligibility information from a credit reporting body or personal information from your employer to verify information in your application, hardship application or insurance claim.

                                    As is the case throughout the Australian Financial Services Industry (and other major industries), technology allows for services to be provided by different service providers including some that are located overseas. We utilise overseas service providers for some of our activities and to do so may need to disclose personal information to those service providers. We may also disclose such information to other overseas recipients for the purposes listed above when permitted to do so by the Privacy Act.
