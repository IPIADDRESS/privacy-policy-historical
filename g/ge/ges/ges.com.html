Advertising: When you visit our Web Site by clicking on certain banner ads or special offers on our partners' Web Site, we track this information to improve navigation and deliver relevant information when you arrive at our Web Site. We also do this because we want to determine if our ads and special offers are appealing to our users. In the course of serving our ads to you, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. In addition, we use web beacons, provided by our third-party ad server, to help manage and optimize our online advertising. These web beacons enable us to learn which ads we place on third-party sites bring users to our Web Site. They do not capture or convey any personal or sensitive information about you. <br> <br>
Browser settings: You can adjust many browser preferences so that you are alerted when a cookie is placed in your browser, or adjust preferences to decline cookies altogether. Recognize that cookies enable you to visit our Web Site without reviewing introductory information. In addition to allowing us to recognize you, cookies also enable us to securely provide our registered users with account information. <br> <br> <strong><a name="emailpolicy"></a>How We Use Your Email Address <br> </strong><br>
We recognize that email can be the preferred mode of communication for some of our Web Site users. If you provide us with your email address when registering for an online service or product or when accessing your account online, we will use it to contact you about online goods and/or services for which you have registered or about your account. <br> <br>
We may use your email address to send you the following types of email messages: </p> <ul> <li>Service notifications related to your accounts(s) </li> <li>Products or services information </li> <li>Promotional offers or updates about our goods and/or services </li> <li>Email newsletters related to GES</li> </ul> <br>
We do not share your email address with non-affiliated companies for them to market their products or services directly to you. However, we may partner with selected non-affiliated companies to offer certain products or services we believe may be of interest to you. <br> <br> <strong>Ads That Link To Our Web Site <br> </strong><br>
GES may use third parties to place banner ads on other Web Sites and will perform tracking and reporting activities through use of ad servers. We do not provide ad servers with your personal information and ad servers do not collect your personal information. <br> <br>
Ad servers are subject to their own privacy policies. If you would like more information about the privacy policies of these ad servers including information on how to opt-out of their tracking methods, please click here to visit the Network Advertising Initiative Web Site. <br> <br> <strong>How We Safeguard Your Information</strong> <br> <br>
GES realizes how important security is to you, so we've taken a number of steps to enhance the protection of personal or confidential information sent to, or from GES over the Internet. <br> <br>
First, we require that a "secure session" be established. This is done any time you supply or access personal or confidential information in one of our secure online areas. This technology creates a private conversation that only your computer and GES systems can understand, helping to ensure that the transmitted information remains confidential. In addition, all of our secure sites require that your browser support 128-bit encryption. <br> <br>
Second, many areas of the site require the use of a user ID and password as an additional security measure that helps protect your confidential information. This allows GES to verify who you are, thereby allowing you access to your account information, and preventing unauthorized access. <br> <br>
Third, in order to bring you the many online goods and/or services offered on GES.com, we work with carefully selected vendors and non-affiliated companies. If we have to share any information with these companies in order to provide a product or service to you, we first conduct a careful evaluation of their information and security systems and practices, and require administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of GES customer information. At any time, we may audit these companies to verify the continued security of their systems and practices. <br> <br>
Lastly, you should be aware that other Internet sites that you link to from the GES site or a GES email may contain privacy provisions that differ from the provisions of our Privacy Policy. To ensure your privacy is protected, we recommend that you review the privacy policy of other Internet sites you visit. <br> <br>
When you have finished using a secure area of GES, make sure you always click on the "Log Out" link which appears on the top of every secure page. When you click on it, no further secure transactions can be conducted without re-entering your user ID and password. This also helps prevent unauthorized access to your account if you walk away from your computer. <br> <br>
You should be aware that browser software often "caches" a page as you look at it, meaning that some pages are saved in your computer's temporary memory. Therefore, you may find that clicking on your "Back" button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page. Caching in no way affects the security of your confidential user ID or password. If you use a computer in a public place to access your account information, simply quit/exit the browser software before leaving to minimize the possibility of anyone else viewing your confidential information. <br> <br> <strong>Your Opt-Out Choices <br> <br> </strong>GES provides users with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving email communications from us at any time. If for any reason you would like to unsubscribe from our communications, please follow the instructions below:
<br> <br> <ol> <li>Simply click the Unsubscribe link provided at the bottom of every email you receive.</li> <li>Send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@ges.com">info@ges.com</a> with the word “Unsubscribe” in the subject line</li> </ol>
To opt-out of receiving offers or email newsletters from other companies, follow the instructions provided by those companies.<br> <br> <strong>For Non-U.S. Users</strong> <br> <br>
The GES Web Site is maintained on servers located in the United States and information collected by GES is also stored on computers located in the United States. The United States may not offer a level of privacy protection for such personal information, as great as that offered in other jurisdictions. Therefore, the disclosure of personal information pursuant to this GES Privacy Policy is at your own risk. We make no representation that the practices described in the GES Privacy Policy are compliant with laws outside of the United States that apply to the collection, security, use and disclosure of personal information. GES will use its best reasonable efforts to maintain the security of personal information. If you are accessing the Web Site from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of our services, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer. <br> <br> <strong>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</strong> <br> <br>
In the event GES goes through a merger, sale, bankruptcy or other business transition, we reserve the right to transfer or assign your information we have collected as part of any business transition. In some cases, such as bankruptcy, GES may not be able to control how your personal information is used. <br> <br> <strong>California Privacy Notice</strong> <br> <br>
Beginning on January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our visitors who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To fulfill the intent of the California law requiring web sites to conspicuously post their privacy policies, we have included the following summary. The purpose of this GES Internet Privacy Policy is to identify the personal information we collect, describe how you can review and make changes to that personal information, describe how you can learn about changes to the GES Internet Privacy Policy, and provide you with a mechanism to opt-out of certain marketing activities.&nbsp;If you wish to opt-out of receiving solicitations from us, or do not want us to share your personal information with partners for marketing purposes, you can record your preferences by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@ges.com">info@ges.com</a> or writing to:<br> <br>
