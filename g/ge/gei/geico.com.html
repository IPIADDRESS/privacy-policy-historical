  <h2>GEICO Respects Your Privacy</h2>

<p>GEICO understands the fact that your privacy is very important to you. Our policyholders have trusted us with their insurance needs for over 60 years, and it is important to us to maintain a high degree of integrity. We want you to understand how we protect your privacy when we collect and use information about you. GEICO does not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>

<h3>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

<p><img src="/images/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="">We may collect non-public personally identifiable information ("Information") as follows:</p>

<strong>Information We Obtain From You</strong>
<p>Information you provide to us during the quoting and/or application process, such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, social security number, driver’s license number, or date of birth.

If you have provided us with your e-mail address, GEICO may use your e-mail address from time-to-time to communicate new services, special offers, and to confirm completion of transactions. If you do not wish to be contacted by e-mail for non-policy related communications, please provide your name and, if you are a policyholder, your policy number when selecting the following e-mail link:
<!-- start: includes/contacts/unsubscribe_email.htm unsubscribe@geico.com-->
<!-- Unsubscribe Email Address -->


<strong><a href="mailto:unsubscribe@geico.com">unsubscribe@geico.com</a></strong>

<!--$Revision: 1.1.1.1 $-->
<!--$Name: newgeico $-->
<!-- end: includes/contacts/unsubscribe_email.htm -->
.</p>



<strong>Information About Transactions</strong>
<p>Information about your transactions and experiences with us and others, such as your balance, payment history, when you have a claim, or coverage and vehicle changes.</p>

<strong>Information From Third Parties</strong>
<p>Information obtained from consumer reporting agencies, which provide us with motor vehicle reports, claim reports and/or consumer credit information where permitted by law. When you have asked for a rate quotation, GEICO may request credit information in accordance with applicable state law. GEICO employees will not have access to the details of your credit information. When GEICO does request credit information, the inquiry will be reflected in your personal credit file maintained by credit reporting agencies. If you commit to purchase an auto policy with GEICO, you give us permission to confirm your motor vehicle record and claims history.</p>

<h3>THE INFORMATION WE DISCLOSE</h3>
<p>Information about our customers or former customers will only be disclosed as permitted or required by law. Information about our former customers will be safeguarded to the same extent as Information about our current policyholders. Information about you which has been collected is maintained in your policy and/or claims records. We use this Information to process and service your policy and settle claims or with your consent or as directed by you. We may also disclose it to persons or organizations as necessary to perform transactions you request or authorize.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> We must exchange information about you with our agents, investigators, appraisers, attorneys and other persons who are or will become involved in processing your application and servicing your policy or any claims you may make.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> When you are involved in a claim, policy information is provided to adjusters and the appropriate businesses that will repair your vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> We may share Information with persons or organizations that we have determined need the Information to perform a business, professional or insurance function for us, such as businesses that help us with administrative functions or with financial institutions with whom we have a joint-marketing agreement. All of these companies are contractually obligated to keep the information that we provide to them confidential and to use the information only for the purpose for which the information was provided.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Information may be provided to organizations conducting actuarial research or audits. In this case, you will not be individually identified in any research report, the organization must agree not to redisclose the Information, and the Information will be returned to us or destroyed when it is no longer needed.</p>


<p><img src="/images/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="">We may also share your Information for other permitted purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>with another insurance company if you are involved in an accident with their insured;  </li>
<li>with our reinsurers;  </li>
<li>with insurance-support organizations that detect and prevent fraud;  </li>
<li>to medical professionals or institutions in order to verify coverage or conduct operations or services audits;  </li>
<li>with state insurance departments or other governmental or law enforcement authorities if required by law or to protect our legal interests or in cases of suspected fraud or illegal activities; or  </li>
<li>if ordered by a subpoena, search warrant or other court order.</li>
</ul>

<h3>CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</h3>
<p><img src="/images/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="">We restrict access to nonpublic personally identifiable information about you to those employees whom we have determined need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain strict physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect your Information from unauthorized access by third parties. In addition, all GEICO employees sign and are bound by a Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Policy.</p>

<h3>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR OUR WEB SITE USERS</h3>
<p>GEICO collects information in three categories when you visit our Web site. GEICO stores information collected by general browsing, when you request a quotation, and when you request policyholder service transactions in a secure environment behind our firewall.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="">When you are browsing the Web site for general information, browsing patterns are stored in our database for review. GEICO reviews customer web browsing patterns to enable us to enhance pages of particular interest to you.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="">When you complete a request for an on-line auto policy quote, information is collected to help us offer you proper coverage. Your information is also used to determine if you qualify for any of our many discounts. If you have recently completed an on-line auto policy quotation, your session data will remain in our quotation system database for 90 days. If you have shown interest in obtaining a quote in the past you may receive a courtesy reminder when your current policy approaches the renewal date.</p>

<p>GEICO may place a small text file called a "cookie", on your computer’s hard-drive to identify you when you return to our web site. No personal information is stored in the cookie.</p>
