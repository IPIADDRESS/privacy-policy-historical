<li><h4 class="legalHeading">What Information We May Collect</h4>
<p>When users visit our website, we may collect "<b>Personal information</b>," which is any information that can be used to identify a particular individual, such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, or other contact information.  When other non-public information, such as product preferences, hobbies or browsing history, is directly associated with personally identifiable information, that other information is also treated as Personal Information.</p>

<span style="font:10px arial">[<a href="javascript:showHide('collecting')" class="smallLink">hide this</a>]</span>
<p>We collect Personal Information about our users in several ways. </p>
<p><u>Personal Information You Provide to Us</u></p>
<p>Most of the Personal Information we receive comes to us voluntarily from our users who are interested in obtaining products and services from us.  For example, Personal Information may be collected when you:</p>

<li>Apply for employment online; and</li>
<li>Purchase cool stuff from NVIDIA's Online Store.</li></ul>
<p><u>Personal Information Collected Via Technology</u></p>
<p>As you navigate our website, our information technology (IT) systems may collect passive information, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, and operating system.  We also use cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information on the date and time of your visit, the products you reviewed, and the areas of our site you visited.  This information allows us to better understand our users and to enhance your experience.

<p>These information collected passively through our IT systems is not personally identifiable on it own.  However, we may combine that information with other personally identifiable information to better serve you. </p>
<p><u>Personal Information We Receive From Others</u></p>
<p>We may receive Personal Information about users from other sources, such as web analytics vendors and marketing consultants.  This information supplements any information that we have collected directly from our users, and allows us to customize our website and products to better serve you.  Sometimes, we may receive Personal Information about people who are not yet users of our website.  NVIDIA's policy is to treat all information obtained from third parties in the same manner that we treat information that we have collected ourselves.</p></div>

<p>NVIDIA may "de-personalize" Personal Information by removing personally identifiable characteristics, such as name and email address, and aggregate data for use in surveys or other business purposes.  NVIDIA may then use and/or share this de-personalized information with third parties.</p></div>
