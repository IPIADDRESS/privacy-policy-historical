<h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>

<p>We require customers who register to use the services offered on our Sites (collectively, the "Service") to give us contact information, such as their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, and credit card number.

<p>Genius uses the information that we collect to set up the Service for customers and their organizations.
