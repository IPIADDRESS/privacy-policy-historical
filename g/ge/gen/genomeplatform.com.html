    <p>Genome, powered by OSM ("Genome"), is a technology platform
offered by interclick, inc. that leverages interclick's proprietary
technology, OSM.</p>

<p>On December 14, 2011, interclick was acquired by Yahoo! and will
soon become part of the Yahoo! network of products and services.
User information collected by interclick continues to be subject to
the interclick Privacy Policy. In the future, you may be asked to
link your interclick account information to an existing or new
Yahoo! ID. At that point, the Yahoo! Privacy Policy will apply to
all information associated with your interclick account.</p>

<p>interclick provides targeted and optimized digital marketing
solutions for advertisers. In the course of providing these
services, interclick collects and analyzes the online behaviors of
consumers across its network of sites. It is critical to interclick
that consumers' privacy, rights and choices are maintained during
this process.</p>

<p>Accordingly, interclick is committed to following the privacy
guideline in accordance with <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/principles.asp" target="_blank">NAI privacy principles</a>.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is intended to inform consumers how
interclick collects, maintains and processes information we collect
in the delivery of our network advertising services.</p>

<h2 class="privacy-header">What types of data does interclick
collect?</h2>

<p>On the interclick network, we collect non-personally
identifiable information (non-PII) such as web sites visited,
content viewed, ad interaction, interaction with advertiser
websites, search terms used, and other click and browsing behavior.
Additionally, we may collect non-PII technical information
including IP address, OS type, browser type, and language settings.
interclick also purchases anonymous consumer interest data from 3rd
party data providers which are associated to web browsers.</p>

<h2 class="privacy-header">Does interclick create or use
potentially sensitive data segments?</h2>

<p>interclick neither creates nor uses sensitive data segments to
provide its targeted and optimized digital marketing solutions for
advertisers. However, we recognize that consumers may have
differing opinions regarding which data segments are sensitive. In
order to provide transparency around potentially sensitive data
segments collected and used by our technology solutions, interclick
provides examples of segments within this policy.</p>

<p>For example, we may use health related segments such
as&nbsp;<em>Interest &gt; Health, Beauty &amp; Personal Care &gt;
Health</em> (<a href="/legal/health-segments.aspx" class="colorbox">click here</a>&nbsp;for a complete health segment
list); or financial segments such as&nbsp;<em>In-Market &gt;
Financial Products &amp; Services &gt; Credit
Products</em>&nbsp;(<a href="/legal/financial-segments.aspx" class="colorbox">click here</a>&nbsp;for a complete financial
segment list).</p>

<p>While we do not use these segments to identify, locate or
contact consumers, interclick encourage consumers to contact us for
more information about our use of potentially sensitive data
segments at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@interclick.com">privacy@interclick.com</a>.
And if you want to view the segments that interclick has stored
about your browsing behavior for targeting purposes, <a href="/legal/opt-out.aspx" target="_blank">click here</a> and
scroll to section entitled "My Categories."</p>

<h2 class="privacy-header">How does interclick track consumer
behavior?</h2>

<p>Cookies are small packets of data stored on your computer that
allow sites to recognize your browser when you revisit the site.
Generally, sites use this cookie to provide services such as
logging you in automatically on repeat visits, delivering you
information, maintaining your shopping cart and understanding how
you are interacting with the site. These cookies enable sites to
customize the site to your needs and interests, so that they can be
as valuable and relevant to you as possible.</p>

<p>Like many websites, interclick sets a cookie on your computer
containing an anonymous identifier. This cookie allows interclick
to better analyze consumer behavior with the goal of providing more
relevant advertising.</p>

<p>You are always free to decline cookies, but by doing so you may
not be able to use certain features on the websites or take full
advantage of all the website offerings and targeted advertising.
You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all
cookies, erase cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.</p>

<p>You may also <a href="/legal/opt-out.aspx" target="_blank" title="opt-out">click here</a> to opt-out of data collection and
targeting cookies from interclick. Please note that if you buy a
new computer, upgrade or change Web browsers or delete this "opt
out" cookie, you will need to perform this process again.</p>

<h2 class="privacy-header">How does interclick use this
information?</h2>

<p>interclick has created a technology that uses consumer
information to create anonymous consumer segments. For example,
consumers that demonstrate car buying behaviors are grouped into an
auto-buyer segment. These segments will be used to target and
optimize advertiser campaigns to consumers who demonstrate that
particular behavior. interclick does not use this information to
identify, locate or contact consumers.</p>

<h2 class="privacy-header">How do interclick's partners use this
information?</h2>

<p>interclick has created a technology platform called Genome,
powered by OSM. Genome is a self-service audience recommendation
and planning platform that enables our advertising partners to
create anonymous consumer segments (e.g., travel enthusiast) to
target and optimize their advertiser campaigns. However, interclick
ultimately cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of any
of our advertising partners and encourages consumers to read the
privacy policies of any website they visit.</p>

<h2 class="privacy-header">Which data does interclick&nbsp;retain
and for how long?</h2>

<p>We maintain non-PII information on consumer behavior and
technical information for 90 days. This data includes web sites
visited, content viewed, ad interaction, interaction with
advertiser websites, search terms used, and other click and
browsing behavior. It also includes non-PII technical information
including IP address, OS, browser type, language settings.</p>

<h2 class="privacy-header">What if I have questions about how my
data is being used?</h2>

<p>We are more than happy to respond to any customer inquiries
about privacy concerns. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@interclick.com">privacy@interclick.com</a> or
at the address below with any questions of complaints.</p>

<p>For more information, about relevant advertising practices,
please see the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a> or <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">Digital
Advertising Alliance</a> web site.</p>

<h2 class="privacy-header">What if I don't want to receive targeted
advertising?</h2>

<p>You can opt-out of the targeted advertising delivered by
interclick by requesting an "opt-out" cookie (a blank cookie) by
interclick, which will prevent information from being uniquely
associated with your browser. This allows you to <a href="/legal/opt-out.aspx" target="_blank">opt-out</a> of receiving
targeted advertising from interclick without erasing other cookies
associated with your browser.</p>

<p>This opt-out means that interclick will store collect
information unique to your browser behavior and will be unable to
recognize your browser from one visit to the next. Opting-out does
not mean you will not receive online advertising by interclick.
However, because interclick is not able to uniquely identify your
browser, interclick is unable to deliver ads tailored to your Web
preferences and usage patterns.</p>

<p>Please note that if you buy a new computer, upgrade or change
Web browsers or delete this "opt out" cookie, you will need to
perform <a href="/legal/opt-out.aspx" target="_blank">this process
again</a>.</p>

<p>To see other companies that offer opt outs and to use other
tools to manage your opt out choices, please visit the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">Digital
Advertising Alliance</a> or the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a> opt out
page.</p>

<h2 class="privacy-header">The right to change this policy</h2>

<p>interclick reserves the right to modify this privacy statement
at any time, so please review it frequently. If we decide to change
it, we will post a link from our homepage, and possibly other
highly visible places we deem appropriate, so that you are aware of
what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
circumstances we may disclose it.</p>

<p><em>This policy was last updated on December 14, 2011.</em></p>

<p>Privacy policy regarding information collected on
the&nbsp;interclick website.</p>

<p>interlick only collects personal information on our <a href="http://www.interclick.com" target="_blank">website</a> when
you make inquiries, and we only use your personal information to
contact you regarding that inquiry. Interclick does not store or
distribute personal information in any other manner. If we are
going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner
different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify
you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use
your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make
any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect
user information already stored in our database, we will post a
prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In
some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who
have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the
changes in our privacy practices.</p>

<h2 class="privacy-header">Tracking</h2>

<p>We do not use cookies on the interclick.com website to track
your usage in a personally identifiable way. We may use cookies to
collect standard information found in a website log file such as IP
address, web browser version, etc, but we do not match this
information to your personally identifiable information.</p>

<h2 class="privacy-header">Additional information disclosures</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to disclose information we have collected
from you if required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief
that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal
process, respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or
safety of our company, our employees, customers, or the public.</p>

<h2 class="privacy-header">Linking to other sites</h2>

<p>A link from genomeplatform.com

We employ many different security techniques to protect such data
from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company.
Only authorized administrators have password-protected access to
our data and we routinely review our security logs and perform
regular security audits.</p>
