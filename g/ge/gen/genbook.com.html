                                            <h3>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h3>
                                            <p>PII is any piece of information which can be traced back to a specific individual user and thus potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate that specific individual.

                                            <p><b>Consumers.</b>&nbsp;If a Consumer chooses to schedule an appointment with a Business User, the Consumer may elect to provide information including, but not limited to, that Consumer’s name, telephone number, and email address (collectively “Consumer Information”), that may be Personally Identifiable Information. We may also collect credit card information from Consumers in circumstances where a Business User has decided that it requires such information to be collected from Consumers scheduling appointments with it through the Services. We may also collect user submitted information including but not limited to ratings &amp; reviews of businesses and service providers with whom the submitting Consumer has interacted through the Services, and any responses or other postings by a Business User.</p>

Examples of non-personally identifiable information include, but are not limited to, the type of internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, your IP address, the time and date of your use of the Services, and whether or not you clicked on hypertext links within the Services.

                                            <h3>Clear Gifs</h3>
                                            <p>We employ or our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. </p>

This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
                                            <p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site and mobile site, to track users’ movements around the site and mobile site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>

                                            <h3>Notifications</h3>

We reserve the right to notify you through e-mail, or notices posted on the Genbook websites, as determined by Genbook in our discretion. In addition we offer Business Users the opportunity to choose to receive text message alerts through their account settings. Please be aware that if you choose to receive text alerts, applicable carrier rates may apply. By using the Services, you consent to receiving such notifications.</p>
                                            <p>Business Users may opt-out of receiving notifications regarding appointments through the Services by logging into their Genbook account and changing the notification settings; opting-out of such notifications, however, will limit the effectiveness of the Services.

If we have provided any third party with your personal information, you will have to contact the third-party directly with any opt-out request.</p>
                                            <p>When Business Users sign up for an account we will use their information to send them our newsletter. If you wish to no longer receive our newsletter you may follow the unsubscribe instructions contained in each of the emails you receive.</p>
