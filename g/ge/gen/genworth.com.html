<tr><td align="center" valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>We and select outside companies who provide services on our behalf use this information in the course of delivering advertisements to you and to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics about visitors to our Web site, in general. We may also use this data to monitor site performance and to make the site easier and more convenient to use. We may aggregate statistics that we gather about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and services, and provide these statistics to third parties. When we provide these statistics to third parties, however, they will not include any personal information that identifies you, unless you have agreed to receive personally-tailored information.</td></tr>

We, along with thousands of other Web sites, use cookies to enhance your Web viewing experience and to measure your Web site usage. With the help of cookies, we may present you with customized offerings or content that may be of interest to you. We may also use cookies to recognize you on subsequent visits or to remember your user name so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. You may be able to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being sent. Please note, however, that, by not accepting cookies, you may limit the functionality we can provide to you when you visit our site.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top">•</td><td><u>Links to other Web sites.</u> We are not responsible for the information collection practices of other Web sites when you link to them from our Web site.

<tr><td align="center" valign="top">•</td><td><u>Access.</u> In some cases, you may be able to update certain information that you provided to us. This may require you to use a unique user name and password (or "PIN").
