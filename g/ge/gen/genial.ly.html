        <p>
            Understand that Genially provides you with a service, but you remain responsible for both i) how you use the Genially service, and for (ii) any data, text, links, information, image and/or any other material ("Content") that you choose to use to annotate and display using the Genially service. The Acceptable Use Policy sets out rules on what kind of use is acceptable and what is prohibited, and by accepting these Terms of Use you also agree to comply with the Acceptable Use Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Should you violate these Terms of Use or the Policies, you are no longer entitled to use the Genially service, and Genially may take any appropriate actions to prevent you from using the service.

        <h3>II. General Conditions</h3>

        <p>

You agree that such alteration will be effective upon posting it on our website, and you will be bound to any such alterations when you use the Genially service after such alteration is posted. It is therefore important that you review these Terms of Use regularly to ensure that you are updated regarding any such alterations.
		</p>

            The Genially service is protected by copyright, trademark, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights of Genially. These Terms of Use do not grant you any rights in the Genially service as such, except for your right to use the service in accordance with these Terms of Use.

        <p>
            We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Genially service. Your materials remain yours.

            </p>
            <p>
                This Genially Privacy Policy provides information on how Genially collects personal data and how it uses that data. Although we believe our approach to processing personal data is fair and reasonable, please review this document carefully as we want to make sure you have full transparency with regard to how your data is used.
            </p>

            <!-- Contents -->

            <h3>I. Name and address of the data controller</h3>

            <p>
                Genially Web S.L. <br>
                C/ Claudio Marcelo, nº6-1ª planta. 14002 Córdoba <br>
                Registered in the Registro Mercantil de Córdoba, Book 2154, Sheet 51, number CO-35517, registration 1ª - C.I.F. B-56019912. <br>
				
            </p>

            <h3>II. Name of the register</h3>

            <p>
                Genially User Register.
            </p>

            <h3>III. The type of information we collect</h3>

            <p>
                We collect both Use Data (which as such does not contain personal data or other personally identifiable information) and Personal Data.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Use Data.</strong> When you use the Genially service, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) may collect information indirectly and automatically (through, for example, the use of your "IP address") about your activities while visiting the websites, including the web pages you view and the times you view them and information about the browser you are using. We use this browsing information for internal purposes such as to help us understand how the websites are being used and to improve them, and for systems administration purposes. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases, your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer Internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session.
			</p>
            <p>
                The Use Data generally does not contain any Personal Data. However, in some cases Use Data can be stored together with your Personal Data in such a way that the Use Data could be considered to be Personal Data as well. In such cases we handle it in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Personal data and personally identifiable information (”Personal Data”).</strong> In some circumstances we can also collect Personal Data, such as your name and address. This could occur upon you registering as a user of the Genially service. In such cases, what type of personal data we ask you to provide will be clearly indicated, and that Personal Data will be stored and processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                We view protection of users' privacy as a very important community principle. We understand clearly that you and your information are one of our most important assets. We store and process your Personal Data (if any) on computers located in the U.S. or E.U. that are protected by physical as well as technological security devices. By using the Genially service, you give Genially Web S.L. consent to store, process and transfer your personal information (if any) outside of your country of residence within the U.S. or E.U. If you object to your personal information (if any) being transferred or used in this way, please do not use the Genially service.
			</p>
            <p>
                We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not use any features of the Genially service that would require you to provide Personal Data to us.
            </p>

            <h3>IV. The purposes for which we use the information</h3>

            <p>
                We use the information we collect for the purposes of providing and developing the Genially service. Some of the features our service offers may rely on the use of information we have collected from you in order to ensure that a given feature is customized and targeted for your specific use.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Personal Data you provide can also be used for direct marketing unless you let us know that you do not wish to receive such marketing or marketing from our partners, provided that you have given your express opt-in consent. The Personal Data can also be used for contacting you if required for the provision of the Genially service.
            </p>

            <h3>V. Your right to inspect the information</h3>

            <p>
                Genially does not verify the accuracy of the Personal Data you provide.

            <p>
                We have also included information about cookies set by third parties (“Third-Party Cookies”).

            <h3>What are cookies?</h3>

            <p>
                Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page in order to remember your user preferences, help analyze the website’s performance and to recommend content relevant to your visit. The cookie will help the website, or another website, to recognize your device the next time you visit. Most cookies will not collect information that identifies you, and will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use our websites, or a user’s general location. What cookies do we use? Genially´s website uses cookies to inform us about how our website is operating, remember your preferences for services such as language choice, what you’ve chosen to purchase and other settings. Without these cookies installed, many of the services offered by the website will fail to function.

            <h3>Cookies set by third parties</h3>
