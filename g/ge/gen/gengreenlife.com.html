  <p class="margins"><b> Updated on January 1, 2008</b></p>

<p class="margins">Thank you for visiting the GenGreen Network ("GenGreen") website. Our privacy policy is simple: we collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us.</p>
<p class="margins">Submitting personal information is voluntary. When you voluntarily submit information, it constitutes your consent to the use of the information for the purpose(s) stated at the time of collection. See Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579) for more information on your rights under the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="margins">For the protection of users of our websites, we have safeguards in place to identify and prevent unauthorized attempts to access or cause harm to information and systems.</p>
<p class="margins"><b>Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website:</b></p>
<p class="margins"><b>Information Collected and Stored Automatically<br> </b><br> The GenGreen web server collects and saves only the default information customarily logged by our server software. Specifically, for each http request received, the date and time, the origination IP address, the object requested, and the completion status of the request is collected and saved.</p>
<p class="margins">We analyze these logs regularly to determine the
traffic through the server in hits, the number of pages served, and the level of demand for pages of interest. We may also analyze accesses to particular pages to determine state the IP address is most likely in, government agency and schools versus private use, and other statistics that may be of value to us in establishing priorities and allocating resources in order to better accomplish our dissemination mission.</p>
<p class="margins"><b>Kids Pages</b></p>

<p class="margins">We are especially concerned about protecting the privacy of children. We hope parents and teachers are involved in children's internet explorations. We respect the need to protect the identity of any children who participate in an Internet exhibition of their work. We do not request any information from children on the Kids Pages. We do however, sometimes encourage them to participate in contests, but such participation is carried out through postal mail.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="margins"><b>Privacy Statement</b></p>
<p class="margins">The GenGreen Online Privacy Statement applies to data collected by GenGreen through the majority of its websites and services, as well as its offline product support services. It does not apply to those GenGreen sites, services and products that do not
display or link to this statement or that have their own privacy statements.<br> <br> At some GenGreen sites, we ask you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites. If you choose
to make a purchase or sign up for a paid subscription service or make a donation, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address that is used to create a GenGreen billing account.</p>
<p class="margins">We may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with GenGreen sites and services. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as you IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring website addresses.</p>
<p class="margins">When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mail from GenGreen, we may use web beacons (described below), customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused
e-mail communications or other information.</p>
<p class="margins">In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interaction with GenGreen, information collected through one service may be combined with information obtained through other services. We may also supplement the information we
collect with information obtained from other companies. For example, we may use services from other companies that enable us to derive a general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your geographic area.</p>
<p class="margins"><b>Use of Your Personal Information</b></p>

<p class="margins">GenGreen collects and uses your personal
information to operate and improve its sites and deliver the services
or carry out the transactions you have requested. These uses may
include providing you with more effective customer service; making the
sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to
repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis
aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and
displaying content and advertising that are customized to your
interests and preferences.</p>
<p class="margins">We also use your personal information to
communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service
communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information
on technical service issues, and security announcements. Some GenGreen
services may send periodic member letters that are considered part of
the service. We may also occasionally send you product surveys or
promotional mailing to inform you of other products or services
available from GenGreen and its affiliates.</p>
<p class="margins">Personal information collected on GenGreen sites
and services may be stored and processed in the United States or any
other country in which GenGreen or it affiliates, subsidiaries or
agents maintain faculties, and by using a GenGreen site or service, you
consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
GenGreen abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of
data from the European Union.</p>
<p class="margins"><b>Sharing of Your Personal Information</b></p>
<p class="margins">Except as described in this statement, we will not
disclose your personal information outside of GenGreen and its
controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent. Some
GenGreen sites allow you to choose to share you personal information
with select GenGreen partners so that they can contact you about their
products, services or offers. Other sites do not share your contact
information with third parties for marketing purposed, but instead may
give you a choice as to whether you wish to receive communications from
GenGreen on behalf of external business partners about a partner's
particular offering (without transferring your personal information to
the third party). See the Communication Preferences section below for
more information.</p>
<p class="margins">Some GenGreen services may be co-branded and
offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use
such services, both GenGreen and the other company may receive
information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.</p>
<p class="margins">We occasionally hire other companies to provide
limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and
delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites,
processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our
services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal
information they need to deliver the service. They are required to
maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from
using it for any other purpose.</p>
<p class="margins">We may access and/or disclose your personal
information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with
the law or legal process served on GenGreen, (b) protect and defend the
rights or property GenGreen (including the enforcement of our
agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal
safety of users of GenGreen services or members of the public.</p>
<p class="margins"><b>Collection and Use of Children's personal Information</b></p>

<p class="margins">Many GenGreen sites and services are intended for
general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information
from children. When a GenGreen site does collect age information, and
users identify themselves as under 13, the site will either block such
users from providing personal information, or will seek to obtain
consent from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their
children's personal information . We will not knowingly ask children
under the age of 13 to provide more information than is reasonably
necessary to provide our services.</p>
<p class="margins"><b>Change to This Privacy Statement</b></p>
<p>We will occasionally update this privacy statement
to reflect changes in our services and customer feedback. When we post
changes to this Statement, we will revise the "last updated" date at
the top of this statement. If there are material changes to this
statement or in how GenGreen will use your personal information, we
will notify you either by prominently posting a notice or such changes
prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a
notification. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to
be informed of how GenGreen is protecting your information.</p>
