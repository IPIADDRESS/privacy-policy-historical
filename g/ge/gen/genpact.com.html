Genpact will take all reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service  providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on Genpact's behalf.<br> <br> <strong>Cookies and other  technologies</strong><br>
Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or  mobile device when you visit a site or page. The cookie will help the website,  or another website recognize your device the next time you visit it. <br> <br>
Genpact may use cookies or similar technology  across its websites to improve their performance and enhance your user  experience. At times we may seek to place a cookie&nbsp; on your device (for instance, your computer's  hard drive) which allows the server to recognise the device when it visits  again, in order to track statistical information about navigation to and  throughout certain areas of our website, and to Genpact promotions on other  websites. The information that is tracked by such a cookie is used only for  internal purposes, such as to improve website navigation and to measure the  effectiveness of our promotional placements. For example, we keep track of the  domains from which people visit and we also measure visitor activity on the  website, but in a manner that would keep the information anonymous. Genpact may  use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better  customer service. <br> <br>
Generally, cookies on our websites are in the following categories:</p> <ol> <li> <em>Essential cookies: </em>Some cookies are essential for the  operation of our websites. </li> <li><em> Performance Cookies: </em>We utilize other cookies to analyze how  visitors use our websites and to monitor website performance. For instance, we might use performance cookies to keep track of which pages are most  popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to determine  why some pages are receiving error messages. We might also use these cookies to  highlight articles or site services that we think will be of interest to you  based on your usage of the website.</li> <li><em> Functionality Cookies: </em>We use functionality cookies to remember your  preferences. </li> <li> <em><em>Behaviorally </em>Targeted Advertising Cookies: </em>Such cookies assist to serve you with  advertisements that we believe are relevant to you and your interests. You  might see these advertisements on our website or other sites that you visit. </li> </ol>
Advertisers sometimes use their own  cookies to provide you with targeted advertising. For instance, advertisers may  use a profile they have built on sites that you have previously visited to  present you with more relevant advertisements during your visit to our website.  We believe that it is useful to our users to see advertisements that are more  relevant to their interests. If you are based in the European Union and would  like to learn more about how advertisers use these types of cookies or to  choose not to receive them, please visit <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu" target="_blank">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>. If you are based in the United States  and would like to learn more, please visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.These websites are not owned by us and  we are not responsible for their content.<br> <br>
We also use or  allow third parties to serve cookies that fall into the four categories above.  We may also use third party cookies to help us with market research, revenue  tracking, improving site functionality and monitoring compliance with our terms  and conditions. <br> <br>
We maintain the highest levels of  confidentiality for this information. This anonymous information is used and  analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns.  If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner, you can either  disable your cookies or opt-out at the download or request page.

We may at sometime in the future collect anonymous information from visits to our websites to help us provide better customer service.
