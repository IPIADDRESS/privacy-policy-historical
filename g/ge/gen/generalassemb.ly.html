        <p>When you visit the Site or use the Service, we and our third-party service providers, which may include third-party analytics service providers and third-party advertisers, may use cookies, server logs and other similar technology to collect and store your preferences, usage statistics, website traffic and performance data, as well as other information such as your IP address, the type of Internet browser or device you use, any website you have come to the Site or Service from and your operating system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files that include a unique reference code placed on a visitors' device to store their preferences and sometimes track information. A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your browser.  Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to our Site or Service and will last for longer.  Some cookies are necessary to enable you to move around the Site and use the Service such as accessing the secure areas of the Site, and they enable us to provide you with the Services you have requested.  “Performance cookies” collect aggregated, anonymous, statistical information on how visitors use our Site and Service.  We use this information to make improvements to the Site and our Service and to enhance your overall experience.  Other cookies, called “functionality cookies,” allow the Site and Service to remember choices you make such as your user name when you login to your account or the language or region you are in. They may also be used to help you watch a video or comment on a blog and are intended to improve your online experience.
        </p> 
      <p>
      We and our third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies and third-party cookies to gather information about the pages visited through our advertising partners, both on our Site as well as other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a "market segment."  This information is then used by us and our third-party vendors to serve interest-based advertisements when you visit our Site and other websites.  For more information about this type of interest based advertising, and about how to opt-out of the automated collection of information by third-party ad networks, please visit the consumer opt-out page for the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. Without these cookies, advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and to your interests. 
      </p>
      <p>
      We also use Google Analytics Advertising Features including Google Analytics Remarketing to advertise across websites, Demographics and Interest Reporting and AdWords and AdSense integrations to collect data about our Site traffic via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers.  We do not facilitate the merging of Personal Information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected through any Google advertising product.  Google may serve ads across other websites that you visit based upon your past visits to our Site, and may also serve our advertisements on other websites.  Site visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ad Settings found at https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads?hl=en.  You can also opt-out of Google Analytics tracking with the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on found at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.

        <h3 id="california">NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h3>
      <p>
      We do not rent, sell or share Personal Information about you with third parties who are not our partners or affiliates for their own direct marketing purposes unless you have opted-in to such a disclosure or were offered the opportunity to opt-out of such a disclosure at the time you provided your Personal Information and elected not to opt-out.  
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>“Do Not Track” Signals.</strong> Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is currently no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals, therefore, our Site, like many others, may not respond to “do not track” signals.
      </p>
      <p>
      In addition, California residents are entitled to know that third parties may collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you visit our Site.  For additional information about this, please refer to the section entitled "Cookies, Automatic Data Collection and Related Technologies."

These third parties may have their own privacy policies but we also require that they maintain the confidentiality and security of any Personal Information disclosed to them in accordance with applicable law. </p>

        <strong>Payments are made through our secure payment solutions providers. </strong> You will be providing debit or credit card information directly to our payment solutions providers that operate a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorizing payment.  Information that you supply to our payment solutions providers is not stored by us or within our control, and is subject to each of our payment solutions providers’ own privacy policies and terms and conditions.
        </p>  
        <p>
          <strong>Events and Partnerships.</strong>  From time to time, we may partner with other organizations to run events.  If you register for an event on our Site and we indicate on our Site that the event is in partnership with or sponsored by another organization, in circumstances where either you agreed to be contacted by marketing communications at the time we collected your information or where we are otherwise permitted by local law to contact you for marketing purposes, your email address may be available to that organization and you may receive emails from them after the event.  Please refer to that organization’s privacy policy for information on how to opt-out of their communications should you receive an email from them but no longer wish to be contacted by them. 
        </p>
        <p>

Other users of the Site or Service may be able to see some information about you, such as information contained in comments posted in a chat room or on a blog post.
