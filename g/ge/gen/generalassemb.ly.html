<p>Please see elsewhere in this Privacy Policy for more information on: types of Personal Information collected, purposes for data collection, types of third parties receiving Personal Information and purposes of disclosure to such parties and your legal rights.</p>



<p><b>DATA RETENTION</b></p>

<p>We will only keep your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.</p>

<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

<p>Details of retention periods for different aspects of your Personal Information are available on request by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ga.co">privacy@ga.co</a>.</p>



<p><b>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</b></p>

<p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the GDPR), data subjects located in the EU have the right under certain circumstances to:</p>

<ul><li class="ga-list-item ga-list-item-disc">Be provided with a copy of your Personal Information held by us;</li>
	<li class="ga-list-item ga-list-item-disc">Request that we correct any of your Personal Information held by us;</li>
	<li class="ga-list-item ga-list-item-disc">Request that we restrict the processing of your Personal Information (while we verify or investigate your concerns with this information, for example); and</li>
	<li class="ga-list-item ga-list-item-disc">Object to any further processing of your Personal Information, including the right to object to marketing;</li>
	<li class="ga-list-item ga-list-item-disc">Request that the Personal Information you have provided be transferred to a third party;</li>
	<li class="ga-list-item ga-list-item-disc">Withdraw consent: where the basis of the processing of your Personal Information is based on consent you have the right to withdraw that consent without detriment at any time.</li>

<p>In response to any of the requests outlined above, we may need to request specific information from you to enable us to confirm your identity and to ensure you have the right to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights).&nbsp; This is a security measure to ensure that your Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who does not have the right to receive it.&nbsp; We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request in order to speed up our response time.</p>

<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.&nbsp; Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.&nbsp; In this case we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

<p>If your request or concern is not satisfactorily resolved by us and you are located in the EU, you may approach your local data protection authority (see <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index%20en.html" target="_blank">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index en.html</a>) who can provide further information about your rights and our obligations in relation to your Personal Information, as well as deal with any complaints that you have about our processing of your Personal Information.</p>
