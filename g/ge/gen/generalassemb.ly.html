      <p>
        This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the General Assembly Terms of Use.  The terms <strong>“General Assembly,” “we,” and “us”</strong> include General Assembly Space, Inc. and our affiliates and subsidiaries.  The Privacy Policy explains how General Assembly may:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>collect,</li>
        <li>use, and</li>
        <li>disclose</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        information we obtain through the General Assembly Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>“Personal Information”</strong> means information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you, such as: name, address, email address, or phone number.  We do not consider Personal Information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual.
      </p>
      <h3>THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY SERVICE COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
      <div class="boxed">
        <p>

        </p>
      </div>
      <p>

        <strong>Cookies, Automatic Data Collection, and Related Technologies.</strong>  The General Assembly Service collects and stores information that is generated automatically as you use it, including your preferences and anonymous usage statistics.  For example, we will also use your IP address to determine your physical location when you log in so we can personalize the Service for you.  You may change your location information in your account settings.<br>
        <br>
        When you visit the General Assembly Service, we and our third-party service providers receive and record information on our server logs, including your IP address, and from cookies and similar technology.
