            Your continued use of the Genes Reunited Service constitutes your acceptance of this Genes Reunited Privacy Policy. At Genes Reunited, a company registered in England and
            Wales (Company Number 04804230) and the operator of the Genes Reunited website, we believe strongly in protecting the privacy of our Members' information. This is a legal
            document that sets out how Genes Reunited handles data which relates to you in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws. You should read it in conjunction

            1. Emails from Genes Reunited</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="body alt">
        <p>
            You are probably most interested in how we will use your email address to communicate with you, so here's our email promise, in plain English:</p>
        <p>
            <b>Service Emails</b>. The team at Genes Reunited hate spam and will never ever send you unsolicited emails. But there are some emails that we will need to send you to provide
            you with a good Genes Reunited service. These include notifications that you have a message from another member, reminders about your membership expiring and guides on how
            to use the site. A full list of the types of emails you will receive to help you use the service most effectively (which we call Service Emails) are shown below:</p>
        <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Welcome emails - this series of emails provide all the information you need to get started on Genes Reunited.</li>
            <li>Payment receipt - this is sent if you upgrade to Full Membership</li>
            <li>Renewal notices - these remind you to renew your Full Membership</li>
            <li>Automatic Full Membership renewal alerts - if you have selected automatic renewal of your Full Membership, we will alert before this happens</li>
            <li>Key service messages - if we need to notify you about changes to the service</li>
            <li>New message notification and reminders - when you receive messages from other Subscribed Members</li>
            <li>Service suspension notices - if you break the house rules</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As well as these Service Emails, you will also receive Hot Matches, Family Trumps and Weekly Updates emails, and (if you have opted to receive them) our occasional newsletters.
            These emails genuinely help you make the most of the website and let you know when there's new, fun and interesting stuff to do. Here's a bit more about them.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Hot Matches, Family Trumps and Weekly Updates Alerts</b>. We automatically send you our Hot Matches, Family Trumps and Weekly Updates Alerts. They are an essential part
            of the Genes Reunited service because they i) tell you when people have been added to the site that may be your ancestors or relatives and ii) find matches who may be your
            ancestors in official records (e.g. 1901 Census) that are in the Records section on the site. The good thing about these emails is that they let you know when you should
            pop back to the site. Without them you would never know there was new stuff to read.</p>
        <p>
            If at any time you decide you don't want to receive the Hot Matches, Family Trumps and Weekly Updates Alerts, all you need to do is uncheck the relevant box in your email
            preferences. You'll find this on the <a href="/member/personaldetails">My Account</a> page which can be accessed from a tab on your homepage
            once you're logged in. Instructions on this can be found at the bottom of every Hot Matches, Family Trumps and Weekly Updates Alert.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Newsletters</b>. When registering, you are given the option to receive our occasional newsletters. We use these to notify you about new features on the site, ask your
            opinion, and tell you about services you might not be using yet.</p>
        <p>
            We only send a newsletter when there is something worthwhile to tell you about, so your inbox will never be overflowing with guff from us. Generally you'll get a newsletter
            about once every month.</p>
        <p>
            If you decide you no longer want to receive these newsletters - or if you aren't currently receiving it and want to - all you need to do is change your email preferences.
            You'll find this in the <a href="/member/personaldetails">My Account</a> area once you're logged in.</p>

        <p>
            We use the information we receive about you through your use of the website, and of the services we provide to you on the website, for the purposes set out below (which are
            discussed in further detail throughout this Privacy Policy):</p>
        <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Managing the website (including your account);</li>
            <li>Providing advanced website features to you;</li>
            <li>Suggesting and providing relevant content to you on the website;</li>

            <li>Sending you emails and other communications (more details below).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You give us permission to use your information for the above purposes in relation to our current service, and also in relation to any new products and features which we may
            provide to you in the future as part of our service.
        </p>
        <p>
            The over-riding principles we apply are these:</p>
        <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>We, and (where relevant) our credit card processing agents, will not supply your information to a third party for commercial exploitation - thus, you can rest assured that
                we will not sell the lists of our Members' email addresses to a third party; </li>
            <li>we occasionally use third party companies to process information that you provide us with: for example, when you complete a survey or make a payment. When we do, we keep
                the amount of personal information they hold to an absolute minimum, have contracts in place to stop them using your information except on our behalf and require them to
                ensure they are as careful with your information as we are; and</li>
            <li>the only circumstances in which we will provide any of your information, including your email address, to a third party (other than a group company or third party secure
                payment provider) for any purpose are those contained in this Privacy Policy or if we are required or otherwise permitted to do so by law.</li>
            <li>Registration and Family Tree Information. The details you provide on Registration, and the details of those you enter into your family tree are only available to you, except
                that names, year of birth and place of birth for you and those in your tree are searchable by other Members. Details in your family tree can be shared with other members
                at your discretion. If you would like to hide details of all living relatives in your family tree, you can do so by visiting the 'My Account' page and choosing Yes in the
                'Hide Living Relations' drop down. Search results from your tree will only be associated with you by your first name (which will be displayed together with the search results),
                your email address is never revealed. </li>
            <li>Emailing through the Genes Reunited Service. We do not directly make your email address available to anyone on any screen of the Genes Reunited Service. The only legitimate
                way of making contact with a Member on the Genes Reunited Service is for a subscribed Member to enter a message that we will send on the Member's behalf. We will notify the
                addressee Member, using the email address he/she has provided to us, that Genes Reunited is holding an email for him/her, and the Member can collect the email when logged
                in to the Genes Reunited Service. Members may check and (if required) change the email address we hold for them at any time through "My Account/Email Address". Members' personal
                notes must not include their email address. Sent and received email may appear in a Member's Inbox on the Genes Reunited Service for an indefinite period - we do not delete
                it after any specific period. However, this does not mean that we will retain your email forever; there may come a time when we will need to delete some or all of it, for
                technical or other reasons. In this event, we will endeavour to give you advance warning that we are going to do so.</li>
            <li>Advertising. The Genes Reunited Service may include interactive advertising for other businesses. We may use, and provide to third parties, anonymised demographic data provided
                by Members to target this advertising more appropriately. Please see 'Our use of cookies' above for more information.</li>
            <li>Credit or debit card information. We use Worldpay plc and Datacash as our payment providers. Both operate a secure server, to process our card payments. They encrypt Members'
                credit or debit card information and authorise payment directly. This means that Members' full card details are never revealed to or held by us. Worldpay plc or Datacash
                may transfer to, process and hold your card information in countries either within or outside the European Economic Area in connection with performing their duties.</li>
            <li>Companies in the Genes Reunited group. We may share data supplied by you (or collected about you) with our subsidiaries and other companies in our group (meaning Genes Reunited
                Limited, brightsolid Online Innovation Limited, and any of their subsidiaries from time to time), but only for the purposes described in this policy or if we are required
                or otherwise permitted to do so by law. In general, we try to make sure that people only have as much access to your information as they need to carry out their job.</li>
            <li>Changes in Genes Reunited's business. If all of the assets which Genes Reunited uses to operate its business (or substantially all of them) are acquired by a third party,
                we may transfer personal data we then hold to that party so that the acquirer can continue to provide the Genes Reunited Service.</li>
            <li>Place of processing. The vast majority of your information held by us is held on and processed by computers situated in the United Kingdom. Some of our third party partners
                use servers in the United States. When we process data in the United States, we only use providers certified under the <a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor/eu/index.asp">EU
                    approved Safe Harbor scheme</a>.</li>
