          Privacy<br>
          </font></b> At Genealogy.com, we are committed to protecting your privacy. 
          We use the information we collect about you to process orders, to help 
          create your own home page and family tree, and to provide a more personalized 
          experience. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy. 
        </p>
        <p><b><font color="#000099" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
          Information Do We Collect?</font></b><br>
          We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop 
          the design and layout of the site. Until you initiate a voluntary transaction 
          with the site, we do not collect personal information about you (such 
          as your e-mail address). Transactions include making a purchase, creating 
          a home page, conducting a search, taking part in a survey, and other 
          voluntary actions. Once you do initiate a transaction, we ask for certain 
          information as specified below: </p>
        <p> When you make a purchase, we ask for your name, e-mail address, mailing 
          address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to 
          process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. 
          If you choose, you may also include your phone number as an alternate 
          means by which we may contact you.
        </p><p>When you create a home page, save a family story, or build a family 
          tree, we ask for your e-mail address and other personal information 
          to enable other genealogists with similar interests to contact you. 
          You may choose not to post this information. This also enables us to 
          send you the URL (or Web address) of your new home page. Your home page, 
          story, and family tree are posted at a Web site for which only you will 
          have the URL and password to edit and delete. Your content automatically 
          becomes part of an online archive that others can see and search, but 
          you have the option to make parts of the content on your home page private.

          you about updates to our Web site, send you your personal identification

          Does Genealogy.com Protect Customer Information?</font></b><br>
          When you make a purchase or access your account information, we offer 
          the use of a secure server. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology 
          to protect the security of your online order information. SSL encrypts 
          your order information and is designed to avoid the decoding of that 
          information by anyone other than Genealogy.com. To check the security 
          of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser 
          window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed 
          lock (depending on your browser), then be assured that SSL is active. 
          Furthermore, Genealogy.com has security measures to protect against 
          the loss, misuse and appropriation of data. We cannot guarantee that 
          loss, misuse or appropriation will not occur, but we make every effort 
          to ensure that they do not.
