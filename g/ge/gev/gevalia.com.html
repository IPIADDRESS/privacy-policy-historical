we take seriously our responsibility to protect customer information, and

to use it only in ways that are consistent with your wishes. We may update

the Policy from time to time, so please check in occasionally.

<td width="100%">At our site, we don’t collect personally-identifiable

information from individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and

knowingly. So, if you just want to browse and learn about our exceptional

coffees and teas, we invite you to do so. As a casual, unregistered visitor

to our site, we’ll recognize your home server (e.g., that your web access

is through AOL.com), but not your e-mail address or any other personal

or system information. 

<p>Of course, since we only sell our coffees, teas and other products through

the mail, if you want to order our products it will be necessary for you

to provide personally-identifiable information. This will include your

name, address, phone number and, if you place an order online, credit card

information. Any information you provide is downloaded off of the web server

to a secure system and is maintained there. </p>

<td valign="TOP"><b><font face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">Our Customer List:</font></b></td>



<td>When you enroll in any of the Gevalia programs or purchase items from

our online catalog, we add your name to our Customer List.&nbsp; From time

to time we share selected names and addresses from this List with other

companies or services that offer fine quality food or merchandise by mail.&nbsp;



<p><b>If you prefer not to receive mailings from these companies, please

advise us by mail, phone or e-mail.&nbsp; </b>Please include your name

and address if you are contacting us by mail or e-mail.&nbsp; We will ensure

that your name is removed from the list we share with other organizations.&nbsp;</p>

</td>

<tr>

<td valign="TOP"><b><font face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">Contacts From Us:</font></b></td>



<td>We also use our Customer List for our own followup contacts with you.

Many of our customers look forward to being contacted by Gevalia Customer

Service Representatives by phone to be kept up-to-date about new coffees

and services, programs and benefits.&nbsp; <b>If you do not wish to be

called regarding these special offers, please let us know by mail, phone

or e-mail.</b>

<p>We also maintain a number of e-mail mailboxes in an effort to support

our online customers as effectively as we do on the phone or through the

mail.&nbsp; We read every e-mail that we receive and do our best to respond

within 48 hours, if a response is required.&nbsp; We save a very limited

number of e-mail messages, but only until the issue is resolved.&nbsp;

We do not record email addresses, unless you have voluntarily provided

it to us in your online customer service registration.&nbsp; </p>



<p>If you did provide us with your e-mail address, we may notify you from

time to time about Gevalia products or services that may be of interest

to you.&nbsp; If you prefer not to receive these e-mail notifications,

please follow the "Opt-out" instructions included with the e-mail

or contact us at customer_service@gevalia.com.&nbsp; </p>



<p>We do not trade, sell or disclose e-mail addresses with other companies.</p>

<td>Like most companies, we use “cookies” (small pieces of information

stored on your computer) on certain parts of our web site. The cookie allows

us to track your session, particularly when you are shopping in the Gevalia

catalog. This is necessary to ensure that we keep your order together while

you browse through the catalog and select items for purchase. We do not

use the cookie to collect any type of personal information, and the cookie

doesn’t extract any information from your computer. <br>

<td valign="TOP"><b><font face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">Security Online:</font></b></td>



<td valign="TOP">Most of our forms, especially when ordering a product or

using online customer service, use secure pages to insure that the information

sent between your computer and our system is secure.&nbsp; This is especially

true if we are asking you for payment information.&nbsp; 

<p>We use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption method on all secure

submissions.&nbsp; This method is generally accepted to insure that the

transmission of personal information, such as account numbers and credit

card information is secure.&nbsp; The most common browsers, Netscape and

Internet Explorer, make it very obvious when information is being passed

in a secure manner by showing either a completed key or a closed lock on

the screen.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
