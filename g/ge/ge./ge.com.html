<h3>GE Privacy Policy for the Internet </h3>	
<p>
The General Electric Company, GE, is sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet.  
We believe it is important you know how we treat the information about you we 
receive on the Internet.
</p><p>
In general, you can visit GE on the World Wide Web without telling us who you 
are or revealing any information about yourself.  Our web servers collect the 
domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors.  This information is 
aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, 
pages viewed, etc.  GE uses this information to measure the use of our site and 
to improve the content of our site.
</p><p>
There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as 
your name and address.  When information is needed, we will try to let you know at the
time of collection, how we will use the personal information.  Usually, the 
personal information we collect is used only by us to respond to your inquiry, 
process an order or allow you to access specific account information.  Occasionally, we may make the e-mail addresses, of those
who provide information, available to other reputable organizations
whose products or services we think you may find interesting.  In these cases, you will be offered an opportunity to limit access 
to your information.
</p><p>
If you register with one of GE’s business units on-line, they may use this 
information to provide you with custom information about GE’s offering in support 
of your business needs.  A technology called cookies may be used to provide 
you with tailored information.  A cookie is a tiny element of data that a web site 
can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we 
can recognize you when you return.  You may set your browser to notify you 
when you receive a cookie.
</p><p>
At times we conduct on-line surveys to better understand the needs and profile 
of our visitors.  When we conduct a survey, we will try to let you know how we will 
use the information at the time we collect information from you on the Internet.  
</p><p>
GE’s website may contain links to other sites such as GE distributors and sales 
affiliates.  While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and 
respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy 
practices employed by other sites.
