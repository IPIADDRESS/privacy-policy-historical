</blockquote>
<h5>Non Personal Information </h5>
<p>We may collect certain aggregate and non personal information when you visit this web site. Aggregate and non personal information does not relate to a single identifiable visitor. It tells us such things as how many users visited our site and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our web site to our visitors. We collect this information either through "cookie" technology or with "web beacons", as explained below.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>Cookies </h5>
<p>Like many companies, we may use browser cookies on this web site. Browser cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer's hard drive when you visit certain web sites. We use browser cookies to tell us, for example, whether you've visited us before or if you're a new visitor and to help us identify site features in which you may have the greatest interest. Browser cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site.</p>
<p>The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new browser cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new browser cookie, and how to disable existing browser cookies. Remember though, without browser cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our web site features.</p>
<p>We also may use flash cookies on our web site to enhance your online experience. Flash cookies are similar to browser cookies, except that they can store data more complex than simple text. Flash cookies, by themselves, cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer. In addition, flash cookies cannot access or remember your email address or other personal information unless you provide the information on this site. We may use flash cookies to provide you with a better user experience. You can manage and disable flash cookies by clicking here for Manage and Disable Flash Cookies.</p>
<h5>Web Beacons </h5>
<p>Certain pages on our site contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party. We use log files to store the data that is collected through web beacons.</p>
<p>We may use third party web beacons to help manage online advertising. These web beacons are provided by our ad management partner. Web Beacons enable our ad management partner to recognize a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our web site. The cookie on your web browser was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with our ad management partner. With both cookies and web beacon technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, postal address, phone number, or email address. </p>
<h5>Third Party Advertising and Links to Other Web Sites</h5>
<p>We may work with third parties to serve our ads on other web sites as well as our web site. Some of these ads contain cookies and/or web beacons that are used to track user behavior. This privacy policy does not cover the use of cookies or web beacons set by third parties. We do not have control over, or access to, the information contained in these third party cookies or web beacons. For more information about these specialized cookies and other technologies, and how to "OPT OUT" of information collection by these companies, we suggest you visit

<p>Personally identifiable information (e.g. Name, email address) we collect consists only of what you share with us. For example, certain products may ask for this type of information so that we may contact you by phone or email at your request. You choose what, how, and when you want to share.</p>
<p>If you use any location-enabled products, you may be sending us location information. GE does not store or use this information other than to provide the service you requested. For example, a mobile product may use GPS data to find a nearby restaurant you requested. Location-enabled features are opt-in and you have control over your participation and can turn these services off at any time.</p>
<p>Web-enabled mobile applications may use cookies or web beacons and other methods to customize your browsing experience. Please see the above GE Appliances Privacy Statement for more information. Some mobile applications will utilize Google Analytics (or similar tool) to help us better serve our customers through improved products, services, and revisions to the mobile applications. This collected information will not identify you to GE. It may, however, let us know anonymously, which services and features you are using the most within the application, as well as device type and hardware features, country and language of download.</p>
<p>Use of 3rd party services such as social sharing sites (e.g., Facebook &amp; Twitter) is governed by the privacy practices of those services. GE does not capture or store your login information or other personally identifiable information for these services, however session info or cookies may be stored.</p>
<h4>Mobile How We Use Collected Information</h4>
<p>We use the information to personalize your experience with the application and to improve your overall experience including the development of new products, services, and features. We also use the information to provide customer support, and when applicable, register and administer your account. Additionally, we may use the information you provide to contact you about updates to our service.</p>
<p>Information you provide may be used to fulfill the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. For example, if you authorize a purchase through a mobile eCommerce application, we will use provided information to ship and bill you.</p>
<h4>Mobile Information sharing</h4>
<p>GE does not share any collected information with 3rd parties with the following exceptions:
</p><ul>
<li>GE may provide some personal data to third-party partners that are providing services essential to your mobile user experience.</li>
<li>All requests are sent through your mobile carrier's network and your carrier may have access to it. Consult your carrier's privacy policies for additional information.</li>
<li>Certain mobile products and services and manufacturers allow you to interact and share your information with others. For example, you may want to Tweet or post to your Facebook page content from a GE mobile application.
