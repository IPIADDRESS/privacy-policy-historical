          <h2>Overall Privacy Statement</h2>
          <p>We take your privacy seriously. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. These privacy practices apply to the Web site that you were viewing when you clicked through to this policy, which is operated directly by us, by our partner, or by our affiliate.</p>
          <p></p><h3><strong>1. What information does GearDownload collect?</strong></h3><p></p>
          <p>GearDownload may collect information from its users in three different ways: directly from the user, from traffic references of hosting servers and from cookies. </p>
          <p>Information provided directly by the user: when you subscribe to a service provided by GearDownload, we may ask you about your name, e-mail address or other personal data. For example, when you register to our website, you need to enter your username, e-mail address and password. </p>
          <p>Information from traffic references: when you visit a website, you unveil certain information about you, such as your IP address, time of visit, place from which you accessed our website. GearDownload, like other operators, stores this information. </p>
          <p>Information collected from cookies: in order to offer you a personalized service, GearDownload may use cookies to ease storing and tracking your preferences. For instance, we may use cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly, or to deliver content specific to your interests; the content contained is not distributed to third parties. </p>
          <p>Cookies are "txt" files offered to your browser by a web server and then stored on the hard-disk of your computer. Most of browsers are set to accept cookies. But if you prefer, you can reset your browser so as to let you know whenever you receive a cookie or even to refuse cookies. However, you should know that some parts of GearDownload website can only be normally seen if your browser allows cookies. </p>
          <p>GearDownload allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the GearDownload site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the GearDownload site. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see. </p>
          <p>You need to acknowledge that, whenever you disclose information in public areas on the website, such as submitting reviews, that information becomes public and can easily be tracked and used by unauthorized persons.

            - information provided directly by the user: this information is used only in order to personalize the services that we offer you and to check your identity;<br>
            - information from traffic references: this type of info helps us identify the parts of our site of most interest for you. GearDownload also collects the IP addresses of its users, in order to safely manage our computer system;<br>
            - information collected from cookies: GearDownload uses cookies to help you with our services and with getting statistic information for the services improvement.

          <p></p><h3><strong>3. Who has access to the information collected from you?</strong></h3><p></p>
          <p>As a rule, GearDownload will never unveil any sort of personally identifiable information about any of its users, without their prior express consent. On the other hand, GearDownload may unveil this kind of data when expressly permitted by law or when this measure is necessary in order to protect GearDownload rights and interests.</p>

The customer's contact information is only used to contact the visitor when necessary. We do not share this information with third parties.</p>
          <p>We may use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. <br>

          <p></p><h3><strong>4. How will I know if the privacy policy is changed?</strong></h3><p></p>
          <p>Any modifications to our privacy practices will be reflected first within this area of our network of Web sites. If there is a material change in our privacy practices, we will indicate on our sites that our privacy practices have changed and provide a link to the new privacy statement. If we are going to be using the information collected from users in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, we will send affected users written notice of the change by e-mail.</p>
          <p></p><h3><strong>5. I have questions, who should I write to?</strong></h3><p></p>
