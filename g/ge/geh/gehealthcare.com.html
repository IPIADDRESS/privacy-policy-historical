GE Medical Systems 
              respects the privacy of visitors to its site. This privacy policy 
              is intended to protect an individual's privacy. It explains what 
              type of information we collect from our users on this site and in 
              the course of our relationship, what we do with that information, 
              and how users can update and control the use of information provided 
              on this site. This policy may change from time to time so please 
              check it frequently. </p>
            <p><b>What Type 
              of Information Do We Collect?</b></p>
            <p> You are welcome 
              to browse some portions of the GE Medical Systems web site without 
              becoming a registered user. For some services or areas on the site, 
              we will ask that you register if you have not already done so and 
              provide us with information about you and/or your company such as 
              name, job title, email address, and other types of information which 
              enable us to provide services and information to you. Once we provide 
              you with a user name and password you will be able to access other 
              parts of our site. </p>
            <p>If you order 
              from our online catalog or use other services available through 
              our site, we may ask you to provide further information, including 
              but not limited to financial information, equipment information, 
              and other personal information. We may collect other personal information 
              when you provide comments or participate in surveys. </p>
            <p>If you use our 
              site to enroll in off line educational courses or to take courses 
              on line, we may collect additional course registration information. 
              In addition, for your convenience, GE Medical Systems may collect 
              and maintain your course credit history. </p>
            <p>If you use our 
              online job search program, our Human Resources staff will review 
              and process your application. If no opportunities are available 
              at this time, we may keep your information on file for purposes 
              of identifying future employment opportunities for you at GE Medical 
              Systems. </p>
            <p>If you provide 
              us with personal data about other individuals, please ensure that 
              they are aware of our privacy policy. </p>
            <p>If you participate 
              in any group forums or use other interactive tools (such as message 
              boards or chat rooms) available on or through the GE Medical Systems 
              site, you should use care not to disclose your personal information. 
              In general, such forums may be viewed by others who visit the site. 
              </p>
            <p>When you visit 
              our site, we collect certain technical and routing information about 
              your computer to facilitate your use of the site. For example, we 
              log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system 
              and CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol address of your originating 
              Internet Service Provider, to bring you the best possible service. 
              We also record search requests and results to ensure the accuracy 
              and efficiency of our search engine. We use your IP address to track 
              your use of the site. </p>
            <p>The GE Medical 
              Systems site uses two types of cookies. "Cookies" are small data 
              files, typically made up of a string of text and numbers, which 
              assign you a unique identifier. A "client cookie" is sent to your 
              browser so that our systems remember your requests and keep track 
              of the pages you view on our site and which services you use. A 
              "server cookie" is maintained on our systems to recognize you when 
              you return to the site. This information allows us to better administer 
              the site and provide a more tailored and user-friendly service to 
              you. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie 
              or to prevent cookies from being sent; if so, you may limit the 
              functionality we can provide you when you visit our site. </p>
            <p>In addition, 
              GE Medical Systems works with third parties to serve advertisements 
              on our sites. These ads may contain cookies which are maintained 
              or tracked by the ad server or advertiser. GE Medical Systems does 
              not control or have access to the advertiser cookies. </p>
            <p>Finally, we 
              collect aggregate information about the use of our site, such as 
              which pages are most frequently visited, how many visitors we receive 
              daily, and how long visitors stay on each page. </p>
            <p>GE Medical Systems 
              strives to have in place appropriate means to protect your information. 
              However, in providing your information over a public or third party 
              network, you do so at your own risk. </p>
            <p><b>How Do We 
              Use The Information We Collect?</b></p>
            <p> The information 
              we collect about you in the course of our relationship is used to 
              facilitate your orders or other activities between us, and to provide 
              you with both general and tailored information about offers, products, 
              services or other useful information from us or others. If you order 
              products or services from us, we may maintain an order history for 
              your account. We also may combine information you have provided 
              to us in communications offline with the information you have given 
              us online (or vice versa), to provide a more customized experience 
              for you when you deal with us. We use demographic and site usage 
              information collected from visitors to improve the usefulness of 
              our site and to prepare aggregate, non-identifying, information 
              used in marketing, site advertising, or similar activities. </p>
            <p>By visiting 
              our web site and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree 
              that due to the international dimension of our company we may use 
              the data collected in the course of our relationship for the purposes 
              identified in this policy, for the purposes identified in our other 
              communications with you, or to provide the information to other 
              General Electric businesses and selected third parties which may 
              be outside your resident jurisdiction. In addition, such data may 
              be stored on servers located in other jurisdictions. By providing 
              us with your data, you consent to the transfer of such data. </p>
            <p>As our services 
              evolve, the types of information we collect may change. Please check 
              this policy frequently for the most current explanation of our data 
              practices. </p>
            <p><b>With Whom 
              Do We Share Information?</b></p>
            <p> We do not sell 
              your email address or other identifying information to third parties. 
              We may, however, share your information with companies that are 
              part of the GE Medical Systems family, other General Electric businesses 
              or selected third parties to achieve the purposes identified in 
              this policy, in our other communications with you, or on the site 
              (for example, to provide you additional promotional materials in 
              which you may have an interest). </p>
            <p>We may provide 
              to others the aggregate statistics about our customers' orders or 
              related site activity for purposes of marketing or promotion. </p>
            <p>We may disclose 
              information about you to others if we have a good faith belief that 
              we are required to do so by law or legal process, to respond to 
              claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of General 
              Electric, GE Medical Systems or others. </p>
            <p>Other companies 
              that provide services on our site, that provide a co-branded version 
              of our site, or that advertise or link on our site, may use cookies 
              or collect other information about you when you go to their site. 
              GE Medical Systems does not control the collection or use of information 
              by these companies. You should contact these companies directly 
              if you have any questions about their collection or use of information 
              about you. </p>

              Accessing Or Changing Information</b></p>
            <p> GE Medical 
              Systems maintains customer information, including order history 
              and site usage data, for a length of time appropriate to our business

              jurisdictions, you may be charged a reasonable fee for access to 
              information. You can opt out of receiving information about non-GE 
              Medical Systems activities, products or services and/or opt out 
              of having your data provided to third parties for marketing purposes
