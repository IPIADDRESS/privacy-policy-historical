1) To send you feedback on your child's reading progress 
2) To communicate with you about purchases 
3) To send you updates about the Epic! Service and/or 
4) For gathering anonymous aggregate information from all our users 
Our service providers or partners may have access to your personally identifiable information as necessary to provide their services.

We, at Epic!, as well as any agents and affiliates with whom we may work, maintain the privacy of all information collected.<br>
</p><h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
Although we collect personally identifiable information from parents, we do not collect such information from your child. Any child under the age of 13 using the service must do so with permission from a parent. All full names, email addresses, and credit card billing information must be from a parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect personal information (including full name, email address, telephone number or home address) from children under the age of 13 in our app. We encourage parents to take an active role in their children's activities and interests on their devices.  When registering your child with the service, Epic! may ask a series of general questions including your child's age, interests and gender. This information is used to customize content to your child's age and interests. We do not use or disclose this information for any other purposes except to provide you with quality service. Any data that is shared is done so on an anonymous, aggregate basis among all users or is related to communicating reading behavior patterns to publishers.<br>

Third Party Applications and Websites
Although the Epic! app is a safe place for kids, a child may leave the Epic! app using the iOS or Android device Home button. Should your child leave the Epic! app for another application or browser, this Privacy Policy no longer applies. We have no control over how other applications or sites collect, distribute or otherwise use your personal information or how they safeguard and secure your personal information.<br>
<h2>Security</h2>
In circumstances where your personal information is collected, we may use procedural and digital security measures that are designed to help protect against loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of information and data, such as password protection and secure socket layer.<br>
