    <h3>GettingMarried.co.uk Privacy Policy</h3>

	<p>Last updated: 1 December 2009.</p>

<p>At GettingMarried.co.uk, we recognise that privacy is important. The following Privacy Policy describes the usage of information that is collected on the site, by both you and visitors to your site. If you have any questions or queries about this Privacy Policy, please do not hesitate to contact us via our website at <a href="http://www.gettingmarried.co.uk/contactus.php">Contact Us</a>.</p>

<h2><br>

  Information

  Collection &amp; Use</h2>

<p><b>Registration</b><br>

In order to

  use this Web site, you must first complete the registration form and create a

  user name and password.&nbsp; During

  registration you are required to give contact information (such as name and

  email address). We use this information to contact you about the services on

our site in which you have expressed interest.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You have the

  option to provide demographic information age and gender to us; we encourage

  you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalised

experience on our site.&nbsp; </p>

<p><a href="http://www.incubate.co.uk">Incubate</a> is the sole owner of the information collected on GettingMarried.co.uk.

  Incubate collects personally identifiable information from our users at several

different points on our Web site:</p>

<p><strong><br>Creating your wedding website<br>

</strong>While creating your wedding website, you will be required to enter

  various pieces of information, including both personal details and about your wedding day. We use

  this information to create your website. You have complete control over what

  information appears on your public wedding site, and no information will ever

be released to any third party.</p>

<p><strong>  Interacting with your wedding website<br>

  </strong>When your guests interact with your wedding website, they may enter

  information about themselves (i.e. the lift sharing facility, RSVPing etc).

  This information is stored securely in our databases and is only accessible to

  the couple who own the site. This information will never be released to any

  third party.<strong><br>

</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sending Invitations to Friends<br>

</strong>If you

  choose to send an invitation to a friend, we will ask you for your friend’s email

  address.&nbsp; We will automatically send your

  friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.&nbsp; Incubate stores this information for the sole

  purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral

programme.</p>

<p>Your friend

  may contact us at <a href="http://www.gettingmarried.co.uk/contactus.php">Contact Us</a> &nbsp;to request that we remove this

information from our database.</p>

<p>Financial details<br>

When purchasing a GettingMarried.co.uk DVD, GettingMarried.co.uk uses PayPal as its gateway to process credit/debit card payments. GettingMarried.co.uk does NOT store (and does not intend to store) your credit/debit card information.</p>



<h3><br>

Uses of Information</h3>

<p>The site uses information that you provide to create the designs on the

  site, and provide starting data for the site’s features. For example, if you

  provide a postcode of the wedding venue, the site will use this information to automatically

generate maps and travelling instructions.</p>

<p>All information sharing is performed with the explicit consent of the user.

  For example, if a guest who is driving to the reception provides information

  about him/herself in the lift sharing section, this information will be stored

  on the GettingMarried.co.uk servers. However, this information will only be

  released to a passenger, if the driver explicitly approves the information

  sharing to proceed (via a link to his email inbox). If the driver does not

approve of the passenger, no information sharing will occur.</p>

<h2><b><br>

  Communications

from the Site</b></h2>

<p>Special Offers and Updates

We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special

  deals and promotions. You can sign up for these emails from us on our

  registration page. You will not receive these emails unless you have registered

for them.</p>

<p>Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive

  these types of communications.&nbsp; Please

see the “Choice and Opt-out.” </p>

<p><strong>Newsletters<br>

  </strong>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletters, we will use your name and

  email address to send the newsletter to you.&nbsp; Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to

  unsubscribe.&nbsp; Please see the “Choice and

Opt-out” section.</p>

<p><strong>Service-related Announcements<br>

</strong>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare

  occasions when it is necessary to do so.&nbsp; For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance,

we might send you an email.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not

  promotional in nature.&nbsp; If you do not

wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. </p>

<h2><br>

Customer Service</h2>

<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we

  will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.&nbsp; We will also communicate with you in response

  to your enquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your

  account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with

  your wishes.</p>

<h2><br>

  Profile </h2>

<p>We store information that we collect through

  cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third party sources to create a

  “profile” of your preferences.&nbsp; We tie your

  personally identifiable information to information in the profile, in order to

  provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of

  the site for you.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We do not share your profile with other third

  parties.</p>

<h3><br>

Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

<p><strong>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</strong><br>

  We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our

  partners and advertisers.&nbsp; This

information does not identify individual users.</p>

<p>We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable

  information.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Personally identifiable information:<br>

</strong>We DO NOT

Share Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties </p>

<p><strong>Service Providers<br>

</strong>We use the services of Google Inc to provide mapping and geolocational

  services on our site.&nbsp; When you sign up

  for your site, we will share co-ordinates of your wedding reception and

  ceremony with Google, as necessary for the third party to provide that service.

  Google does not have access to any personally identifiable information – it purely

produces a map based upon input co-ordinates.</p>

<h2><br>

Legal Disclaimer</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to disclose

  your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe

  that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a

  judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site</p>

  <h2>Choice/Opt-out</h2>

<p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional

    communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions

  included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us via <a href="http://www.gettingmarried.co.uk/contactus.php">Contact Us</a>.</p>

  <h3><br>

    Log

  Files</h3>

  <p>As is true

    of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in

    log files.&nbsp; This information includes

    internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider

    (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream

  data.&nbsp; </p>

  <p>We use this

    information, which does not identify individual users, to analyse trends, to

    administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather

  demographic information about our user base as a whole.&nbsp; </p>

  <p>We do link

  this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>

  <h2><br>

  Cookies</h2>

<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for

  record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the

  information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you

  submit while on our site.</p>

<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.&nbsp; We use session cookies to make it easier for

  you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you

  browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period

  of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in

  your Internet browser’s “help” file.</p>

<p>We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to

  enter it more than once.&nbsp; Persistent

  cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to

  enhance the experience on our site.&nbsp; </p>

<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to

  use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.</p>

<p>This privacy statement covers the

  use of cookies by GettingMarried.co.uk only and does not cover the use of

  cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h2><br>

Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h2>

<p>If you came

  to our site via a Google advertising campaign, we employ a software technology called clear gifs

  (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site

  by informing us which advertisements are effective.&nbsp; Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique

  identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online

  movements of Web users.&nbsp; In contrast to

  cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are

  embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end

  of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our

  customers’ personally identifiable information. </p>

<p>To learn

  more about Google’s use of clear gifs, please go to <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</a></p>

<p>We use clear

  gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by

  recipients.&nbsp; This allows us to gauge the

  effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing

  campaigns.&nbsp; If you would like to opt-out

  of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.” </p>

<h2><strong>Links

  to Other Sites</strong></h2>

<p>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or

  controlled by Incubate. Please be aware that we, Incubate, are not responsible

  for the privacy practices of such other sites.&nbsp; 

</p>

<p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the

  privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally

  identifiable information.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web

  site. </p>

<h2><strong><br>

  Bulletin Boards/Chat Rooms</strong></h2>

<p>If you use the bulletin board or chat room on this site, you should be

  aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be

  read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to

  send you unsolicited messages.&nbsp; We are

  not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to

  submit in these forums.<i></i></p>

<h3><br>

    <strong>Access

  to Personally Identifiable Information</strong></h3>

<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer

  desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making

  the change on our member information page, or by emailing our Customer Support

  at <a href="http://www.gettingmarried.co.uk/contactus.php">Contact Us</a>.</p>

<h3><strong><br>

  Security

  </strong></h3>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to

  protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and

  once we receive it.&nbsp; No method of

  transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%

  secure, however.&nbsp; Therefore, while we

  strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal

information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about security on our

Web site, you can send email us via <a href="http://www.gettingmarried.co.uk/contactus.php">Contact Us</a></p>

<h3><br>

Business Transitions</h3>

<p>In the event

  Incubate goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by

  another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally

  identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.&nbsp; You will be notified via email and a prominent

  notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control

of your personal information.</p>

<h3><br>

  Changes in this Privacy Statement  </h3>

<p>If we decide

  to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy

  statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are

  aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what

circumstances, if any, we disclose it.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We reserve

  the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it

  frequently.&nbsp; If we make material changes

  to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on

our home page.</p>

<h3><br>

  Contact Us 

  </h3>

<p>If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy,

  please contact us via our contact form at <span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"><a href="http://www.gettingmarried.co.uk/contactus.php">Contact Us</a>, or our
