                    <p><b>What is personal information?</b></p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of data protection is to protect personal information. Personal information means any information relating to an identified
                        or identifiable natural person ("<b>data subject</b>"). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly,
                        in particular, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more
                        factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. This
                        information includes, for example, details such as name and email address, but also information in connection with payments.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Information AdBlock collects</h2>

                    <p><b>Personal information</b></p>
                    <p>
                        When you visit the AdBlock website we collect IP address, unique ID, logging of some of the button clicks on our website (clicking download,
                        for example) and user event logging data. When the AdBlock extension communicates with AdBlock servers, we receive the computer’s IP address.
                        After six months we will remove any identifying information such as IP address from our log files and databases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you donate from the AdBlock website, we collect and store all information, excluding the credit card number, given during
                        the payment process. This includes IP address, unique ID, logging some of the button clicks (payment, download buttons) and user event logging.
                        AdBlock does not handle or have access to full credit card numbers, bank account details or payment account login information. Each payment
                        processor stores and uses the data you provide them differently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        AdBlock uses both Stripe and PayPal as payment processors when you donate to AdBlock. To learn more about their data collection policies,
                        please consult their respective privacy policies when using them.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Anonymous information</b></p>
                    <p>
                        The AdBlock extension captures anonymous usage information including, but not limited to, the version number of the extension, preferred language,
                        Acceptable Ads opt-in, opt-in to advanced features like our local content caching service, number of blocked requests, number of ads blocked, and
                        browser and operating system type. The AdBlock extension also assigns an anonymous, unique ID to each installation. We store aggregate statistics
                        about the installation connected with each user ID indefinitely. We utilize this information to help us identify and fix potential issues with
                        AdBlock as well as to determine the performance of AdBlock features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The iOS extension captures connection type (wifi or mobile) in addition to the data that the browser extension captures.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Extension error information</b></p>
                    <p>
                        An error report is automatically sent to AdBlock's servers whenever an error occurs in the extension. The report contains the anonymous
                        information stated previously along with the current browser version and a description of the error. If a URL exists in the error description
                        then the extension will attempt to remove it. The data is used for troubleshooting and to identify general defects which lead to unexpected
                        crashes or errors. After 7 days we will remove this information from our log files and databases.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Server logs</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Logs for general requests made to getadblock.com or its infrastructure are kept for up to 90 days. These logs include the IP address, browser,
                        operating system, and page address. We will anonymize the IP address by using a hash to encrypt this information and we will immediately
                        delete the original IP address. This data is used to generate usage statistics as well as to investigate potential security issues. After
                        90 days, we will remove this information from our log files and databases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Logs for payment processing requests are kept in accordance with US tax law retention periods and will be deleted after the end of the
                        respective retention period. Information in these logs includes IP address, email (if provided), address (if provided), name (if provided),
                        browser type and version, operating system, payment amount, payment type, card type, expiration date, and last four digits of the card if a card is used.
                        This data is used to provide insights into the financial performance of AdBlock.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Analytics</b></p>
                    <p>
                        AdBlock uses Google Analytics to aggregate information about traffic patterns and how our website and extension are used. We limit the data
                        sent to Google Analytics, and only do so to improve our extension and website. You can find information about Google Analytics’ data collection

                        We use Google Analytics on our Website, a web analysis service of Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies" (text
                        files which are stored on your computer and which enable you to analyse your use of our Website). The information generated by the cookie
                        on your use of our Website (including your abbreviated IP address) is transmitted to a Google server in the United States and are stored
                        there. Google will use this information to assess your use of our Website, to compile reports on the activities for us and to provide more
                        services connected with use of our Website and the internet. It is also possible that Google may transmit this information to third parties

                    <p><b>We try to make AdBlock better</b></p>
                    <p>
                        We use the collected usage and analytics information to maintain and improve the AdBlock extension and website, gain insight into how
                        our services are being used, and in our efforts to prevent fraud. The information is only used internally.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Your information is not for sale</b></p>
                    <p>
                        AdBlock never has and never will sell your personal information to any third party without your consent. We sometimes share anonymized and
                        aggregated information that cannot be associated with an individual with third parties or the public.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>AdBlock discloses personal information as required by law</b></p>
                    <p>
                        AdBlock cooperates with all valid United States law enforcement requests and court orders. If possible, we'll notify you of requests for
                        your information using the email stored in our system. Some circumstances prohibit us from contacting you about a request or order (e.g.
                        an order under 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b) or § 215 of the Patriot Act). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary">"Warrant canary"</a>:
                        AdBlock has never received an order under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, and if this sentence ever disappears, you'll know it's because we
                        have received such an order -- or similar order -- and the U.S. Government made us delete it.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>AdBlock discloses personal information as part of business development</b></p>
                    <p>
                        As part of the further development of our business, it may happen that the structure of BetaFish, Inc. changes. The legal structure may be
                        adapted, subsidiaries, business units or components may be created, bought or sold. In such transactions user information may be shared with
                        the transmitted part of the company. In the event of a transfer of personal information BetaFish, Inc. will ensure that it is done in
                        accordance to this privacy policy and the GDPR and applicable EU laws.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will not transfer your personal data to third parties as a matter of course without letting you know in advance. We will ask for your
                        prior permission unless the transfer of such data is permitted by GDPR or any other applicable EU laws.

                    <h2>External services</h2>
                    <p>
                        AdBlock uses external services that may require you to enter personal information. We currently use
                        FreshDesk (privacy policy <a href="https://www.freshworks.com/privacy/">here</a>) for AdBlock's
                        <a href="https://help.getadblock.com">knowledge base and support system</a>. AdBlock has used other services in the past
                        and may use more in the future. We do not control the data on these external services and can not remove or delete the data;
                        any data given to external services is not bound by this policy, and you should read the external service's privacy policy before providing any information.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Data security</h2>
                    <p>
                        All personal and usage information that AdBlock collects is stored in our databases and AdBlock takes reasonable steps to keep it secure.
                        That said, no database or server is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data in our system or while being
                        transmitted over the Internet. Our best effort is given, but you use AdBlock's website and browser extension at your own risk.

                    <p>

                        Prior to entering into such contract, the collection and processing of your personal information may also be necessary in order to take steps
                        at your request. This applies for installation and the use of our extension as well as any payment processing in connection with donations.

                        The collection and processing of your personal information may be necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. We collect and process
                        server logs for technical reasons, such as, but not limited to, preventing denial of service attacks. Denial of service is typically accomplished

                        from being fulfilled. Preventing such overloads of our systems and any security issues by denial of service attacks is in your and our vital interest
                        and therefore we use the website logs. We use information collected and processed via subscription downloads, extension update checks, emergency
                        notifications and feedback data sent by you, for technical reasons, such as, but not limited to, ensuring the security of the extension version used
                        by you. Ensuring the security of our extension is in your and our vital interest and therefore we use such data. Furthermore, we collect and process
