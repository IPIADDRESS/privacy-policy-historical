                    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                    <p style="font-size: 13px"><span>Effective Date:</span> December 30, 2014</p>
                    <p>
                        This Privacy Policy describes AdBlock's information practices for its website and browser extension.  
                        We take your privacy seriously and want you to understand exactly what information 
                        we collect, how we use that information, which pieces of information you can request us to remove, 
                        and how to contact us about this policy.  Please read this policy carefully.  Your continued use of 
                        the AdBlock extension and/or the AdBlock website constitues your agreement to this policy.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        When it comes to your personal information, most of this policy applies to users who choose to donate 
                        to support AdBlock.  If all you do is use the extension then you're practically invisible to us.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Information AdBlock collects</h2>

                    <p><b>Personal information</b></p>
                    <p>
                        The AdBlock website collects and stores all information, excluding the credit card number, given during the payment process.  
                        AdBlock does not handle or have access to full credit card numbers or payment account login information.  
                        Each payment processor stores and uses the data you provide them differently; please consult
                        their privacy policies (<a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full">PayPal</a>, 
                        <a href="https://stripe.com/us/terms">Stripe</a>,
                        <a href="https://payments.amazon.com/help/Personal-Accounts/Privacy-Security/Privacy-Notice">Amazon</a>).
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Anonymous information</b></p>
                    <p>
                        The AdBlock extension captures anonymous usage information, including but not limited to: current version of the extension, 
                        preferred language, Google search text ads opt-in, number of blocked requests,
                        and browser and operating system type.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Extension error information</b></p>
                    <p>
                        An error report is automatically sent to AdBlock's servers whenever an error occurs in
                        the extension.  The report contains the anonymous information stated previously along with 
                        the current browser version and a description of the error.  If a URL exists in the 
                        error description then the extension will attempt to remove it.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Server logs</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Logs for general requests made to getadblock.com or its infrastructure are kept for 7 days.  
                        These logs include the IP address, browser, operating system, and page address.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Logs for payment processing requests are kept for 90 days.  Information in these logs includes
                        IP address, email (if provided), address (if provided), name (if provided), browser type and version, 
                        operating system, payment amount, and card type, expiration date, and last four digits of the card if a card is used.  
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Analytics</b></p>
                    <p>
                        AdBlock uses various analytics services to aggregate information about traffic patterns and how our website and 
                        extension are used.  We limit the data sent to these services, and only do so to 
                        improve our extension and website.  AdBlock currently uses Google Analytics 
                        (privacy policy <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245">here</a>) and Mixpanel 
                        (privacy policy <a href="https://mixpanel.com/privacy/">here</a>).
                    </p>

                    <h2>How AdBlock uses and discloses collected information</h2>
                    
                    <p><b>We try to make AdBlock better</b></p>
                    <p>
                        We use the collected usage and analytics information to maintain and improve the AdBlock extension 
                        and website, gain insight into how our services are being used, and in our efforts to prevent fraud.  
                        The information is only used internally.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Your information is not for sale</b></p>
                    <p>
                        AdBlock never has and never will sell your personal information to any third party without your consent.  
                        We sometimes share anonymized and aggregated information that cannot be associated with an individual 
                        with third parties or the public.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>AdBlock discloses personal information as required by law</b></p>
                    <p>
                        AdBlock cooperates with all valid United States law enforcement requests and court orders.  If possible,
                        we'll notify you of requests for your information using the email stored in our system.  Some 
                        circumstances prohibit us from contacting you about a request or order (e.g. an order under 18 U.S.C. 
                        ยง 2705(b) or ยง 215 of the Patriot Act).  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary">"Warrant canary"</a>: 
                        AdBlock has never received an order under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, and if this sentence 
                        ever disappears, you'll know it's because we have received such an order -- or similar order -- and the 
                        U.S. Government made us delete it.
                    </p>

                    <h2>External services</h2>
                    <p>
                        AdBlock uses external services that may require you to enter personal information.  We currently use 
                        Tender (privacy policy <a href="http://tenderapp.com/privacy/">here</a>) for AdBlock's knowledge base and support system at http://support.getadblock.com.  
                        AdBlock has used other services in the past and may use more in the future.  We do not control the data on 
                        these external services and can not remove or delete the data; any data given to external services is not bound by 
                        this policy, and you should read the external service's privacy policy before providing any information.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Your information choices and options</h2>
                    <p><b>Personal information removal</b></p>
                    <p>
                        If you have attempted a payment on the AdBlock website then you can request to have your email and name removed from our system.  To 
                        do this, please open a private ticket <a href="http://support.getadblock.com/">on our support site</a> that contains 
                        your Order ID or email for the purchase.  Please note that AdBlock can only remove information from our own systems and cannot 
                        make changes to data that you give to a payment processor.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Data security</h2>
                    <p>
                        All personal and usage information that AdBlock collects is stored in our databases and AdBlock takes reasonable 
                        steps to keep it secure.  That said, no database or server is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the 
                        absolute security of your data in our system or while being transmitted over the Internet.  Our best effort 
                        is given, but you use AdBlock's website and browser extension at your own risk.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Changes and updates to this policy</h2>
                    <p>
                        AdBlock reserves the right to change this policy for any reason, and may make small, inconsequential changes to this 
                        policy with or without notice.  Each time this policy is changed we will revise the "Effective Date" at the top of this page.  
                        When substantial changes are made to the disclosure of your personal information AdBlock will attempt to notify you through 
                        the email that was provided during the payment process.  Your continued use of the AdBlock website or browser extension constitutes your
                        agreement to this Privacy Policy and any revisions or updates.
                    </p>
