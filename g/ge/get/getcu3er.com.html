            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
MADEBYPLAY d.o.o. (“MADEBYPLAY”) respect your right to privacy and feel it is
important for You to know how we handle the information we receive from You via
our website at <a href="http://getcu3er.com">http://getcu3er.com</a> (the “Site”) and through our tools and
services offered on the Site (the “Service”).
</p>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>
Like most website operators, MADEBYPLAY collects non-personally-identifying information
of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
visitor request. MADEBYPLAY’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
information is to better understand how MADEBYPLAY’s visitors use the Site. From
time to time, MADEBYPLAY may release non-personally-identifying information in
the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Site.
</p>

<p>
MADEBYPLAY also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. MADEBYPLAY does not use such information to
identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other
than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
information, as described below. 
</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>
Certain visitors to Site choose to interact with MADEBYPLAY in ways that require
MADEBYPLAY to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type
of information that MADEBYPLAY gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at <a href="http://getcu3er.com">http://getcu3er.com</a> to
provide a name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with MADEBYPLAY
– by purchasing CU3ER PRO license and access to the CU3ER PRO account ,
for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary
the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.
</p>

<p>In each case, MADEBYPLAY collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with MADEBYPLAY. MADEBYPLAY does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>MADEBYPLAY may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. MADEBYPLAY may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, MADEBYPLAY does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>
MADEBYPLAY discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations
that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on MADEBYPLAY’s
behalf or to provide services available at MADEBYPLAY’s websites, and (ii) that
have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors
and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
using Site, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. MADEBYPLAY
will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
organizations, as described above, MADEBYPLAY discloses potentially personally-identifying
and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or
when MADEBYPLAY believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary
to protect the property or rights of MADEBYPLAY, third parties or the public
at large. 
</p>

<p>MADEBYPLAY uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for MADEBYPLAY.</p>

<p>
If you are a registered user of Site and have supplied
your email address, MADEBYPLAY may occasionally send you an email to tell you
about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s
going on with Site and MADEBYPLAY products. If you send us a request
(for example via a support email or ticket via one of our feedback/support mechanisms),
we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to
your request or to help us support other users. MADEBYPLAY takes all measures
reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration
or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information.
</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>

and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor

their usage of Site, and their website access preferences. MADEBYPLAY visitors
who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers
to refuse cookies before using MADEBYPLAY’s websites, with the drawback that
certain features of MADEBYPLAY’s websites may not function properly without the
