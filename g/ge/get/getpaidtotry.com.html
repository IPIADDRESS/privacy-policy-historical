				<h1>Privacy Policy - Effective Date: April 3, 2009</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>Information Collected</strong><br>
					The information collected by GetPaidToTry is used to better serve you. We collect your name and address to provide payment to 
					you. Demographical information about you, including birth date, gender, marital status, and interests are collected to send you 
					paid emails corresponding to your information. Your personal information is physically given to advertisers who pay for mailings 
					when you select co-registration boxes (ads for separate sites) on our signup form or on a page in our registration path. The 
					information provided to these advertisers varies based on advertising campaign requirements. <br>
					In addition to the information collected by us and registration information submitted by you, we may employ both first-party and 
					third-party cookies.  A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing activity-based information about you, and 
					it is designed to facilitate the receipt of targeted and relevant advertisements.  The cookie is not associated with your personally 
					identifiable information.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Means of Collection</strong><br>
					At this time, the only way to become a member of GetPaidToTry is by filling out our signup form. Members will not be acquired 
					through purchases, other companies, or mergers. However, GetPaidToTry reserves the right to purchase email addresses and market 
					offers to these individuals as a separate function of our site. These individuals are not considered GetPaidToTry members, and 
					are not paid to receive these email promotions.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Use of Information</strong><br>
					The information you provide us serves two purposes. One of these purposes is for GetPaidToTry to contact you regarding updates to 
					our program and other essential contacts between the company and its members. The other purpose is to match you with paying 
					advertisers using the demographic information you provide upon signup. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Posting of Personal Information</strong><br>
					We have a ZERO Tolerance against cheating! Any member deemed to be cheating our program, depending on the seriousness of the fraud 
					involved, automatically forfeits their coverage under our Privacy Policy. We hereby claim the right to post any and all information 
					provided by any Member that has attempted to fraud our company. We believe this will make members seriously consider their actions 
					before attempting to cheat. This action is reserved for serious offenses only. We will not post every cheating offense on this page, 
					just the ones we deem to be malicous.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Minimum Required Age</strong><br>
					In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, Members must be at least 13 years old to participate in our program. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Information from Third Parties</strong><br>
					We may collect your information when you provide it to a third party, and we subsequently purchase, license or lawfully acquire the 
					information from that party. The information that we collect may include but is not limited to your name, address, email address, 
					street address, zip code, telephone numbers, birth date, gender, salary range, education, marital status, occupation, employment 
					status, person and online interests, and other information that you may have provided to the third party. When acquiring data from 
					outside sources, we seek assurances that the party has the right to transfer the information to us, that the data was not improperly 
					obtained, and that we have the right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose information is provided to us.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Subject to Change</strong><br>
					By registering as a member at GetPaidToTry.com, you agree to accept this Privacy Policy and are aware that our policy may change from 
					time to time, as our company grows and our plans change. We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time without notification 
					to our Members; however, if any major updates take place, we will post this information with a pertinent link on our site. 
					<br><br>
					It is the responsibility of our members to review this policy periodically to ensure that they are aware of our rules and regulations 
					so users are aware of what Personally Identifiable Information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we 
					disclose it. In the event that a change is made after user registration the user will be notified via e-mail and be given the opportunity 
					to opt-out prior to those changes going into effect.
					<br>
					This policy will be available on this page for members to read.
