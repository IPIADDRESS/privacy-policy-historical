							<strong>Information Collected:</strong><p></p>
				      <p>The information collected by GetPaidToTry is used to better serve 
				        you. We collect your name and address to provide payment to you. 
				        Demographical information about you, including birth date, gender, 
				        marital status, and interests are collected to send you paid emails 
				        corresponding to your information. 
				        Your personal information is physically given to advertisers 
				        who pay for mailings when you select co-registration boxes 
				        (ads for separate sites) on our signup form or on a page in our registration path. 
				        The information provided to these advertisers varies based on advertising campaign
				        requirements.  
				        <!--
				        We reserve the right to provide information collected to 
				        advertisers as well as the right to provide information to third parties for
				        email marketing campaigns.
				        -->
				      </p>
				      <p><strong>Means of Collection:</strong></p>
				      <p>At this time, the only way to become a member of GetPaidToTry is 
				        by filling out our signup form. Members will not be acquired through 
				        purchases, 
				        other companies, or mergers. However, GetPaidToTry reserves the right 
				        to purchase email addresses and market offers to these individuals 
				        as a separate 
				        function of our site. These individuals are not considered GetPaidToTry 
				        members, and are not paid to receive these email promotions.</p>
				      <p><strong>Use of Information:</strong></p>
				      <p>The information you provide us serves two purposes. One of these 
				        purposes is for GetPaidToTry to contact you regarding updates to 
				        our program and other essential contacts between the company and its members. The 
				        other purpose is to match you with paying advertisers using the 
				        demographic information you provide upon signup. 
				        <!--
				        We reserve the right to provide information collected to 
				        advertisers as well as the right to provide information to third parties for
				        email marketing campaigns.
				        -->
				      </p>
				      <p><strong>Posting of Personal Information:</strong></p>
				      <p>We have a ZERO Tolerance against cheating! Any member deemed to 
				        be cheating our program, depending on the seriousness of the fraud 
				        involved, automatically forfeits their coverage under our Privacy Policy. 
				        We hereby claim the right to post any and all information provided 
				        by any Member that has attempted to fraud our company. We believe this will make members 
				        seriously consider their actions before attempting to cheat. This 
				        action is reserved for serious offenses only. We will not post every cheating offense 
				        on this page, just the ones we deem to be malicous.</p>
				      <p><strong>Minimum Required Age:</strong></p>
				      <p>In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 
				        Members must be at least 13 years old to participate in our program. 
				      </p>
				      <p><strong>Information from Third Parties:</strong></p> 
							<p>
								We may collect your information when you provide it to a third party, and we subsequently purchase, license or lawfully acquire 
								the information from that party. The information 
								that we collect may include but is not limited to your name, address, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers, 
								birth date, gender, salary range, education, marital status, occupation, employment status, person and online interests, and other 
								information that you may have provided to the third party. When acquiring data from outside sources, we seek assurances that the party 
								has the right to transfer the information to us, that the data was not improperly obtained, and that we have the right to provide offers 
								from advertisers to the individuals whose information is provided to us.
								<br><br>
								When you register with GetPaidToTry.com and you leave the box checked stating "By checking this box, you agree to receive email from 
								GetPaidToTry-Offers.com" - you explicitly authorize us to share your information with 
								Datran Media to contact you via email.

				      <p><strong>Subject to Change:</strong></p>
				      <p>By registering as a member at GetPaidToTry.com, you agree to accept 
				        this Privacy Policy and are aware that our policy may change from 
				        time to time, as our company grows and our plans change. We reserve the right 
				        to modify this Policy at any time without notification to our Members; 
				        however, if any major updates take place, we will post this information with 
				        a pertinent link on our site. </p>
				      <p>It is the responsibility of our members to review this policy periodically 
				        to ensure that they are aware of our rules and regulations so users 
				        are aware of what Personally Identifiable Information we collect, how we use 
				        it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. In the 
				        event that a change is made after user registration the user will be notified via e-mail 
				        and be given the opportunity to opt-out prior to those changes going 
				        into effect. <br>
				        This policy will be available on this page for members to read.</p>
