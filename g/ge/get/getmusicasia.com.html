		    <h1 class="privh1">Getmusic India Privacy Policy</h1>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>Universal Music India Private Limited ("UMI" or “we”) respects the privacy of the individuals it deals with, and is committed to complying fully with its obligations under the National Privacy Principles ("NPPs"), . "Personal information" is information or opinion about an individual that identifies the individual, or from which it is reasonably possible to determine the individual’s identity.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>This Policy outlines the types of personal information UMI collects and explains how it collects, uses, discloses and holds that information.  The Policy also explains how you can gain access to personal information that UMI holds about you and provides contact details for UMI.  Finally, the Policy sets out the way UMI handles personal information online (i.e. on the internet) and how UMI uses and discloses personal information that it collects about individuals it deals with in the context of its business activities and relationships (our "business contacts").</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>This privacy policy applies to all UMI websites including, but not limited to, Get Music India.</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="privsub">1. How is Personal Information Used?</p>
		    <p>UMI is one of India’s largest producers and distributors of entertainment goods and services.  For the purposes of this Policy, these are referred to as "our goods and/or services".</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p>The primary purpose for which UMI collects personal information is so that we can provide you with our goods or services and provide you with information in relation to our goods or services.  UMI also uses your personal information for purposes incidental to these purposes including, without limitation, for the purpose of managing its relationship with you, communicating with you effectively and identifying which of our goods and services may interest you in the future.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>UMI does not collect information it does not need.  For example, UMI does not collect sensitive information (such as information about your health or political beliefs) because it does not need it in order to provide you with our goods or services.<br>
		    </p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="privsub">2. What Personal Information does UMI Collect?</p>
			  <p>If you ask UMI to provide you with our goods or services (including signing up to join one of its clubs, submitting a competition entry form, or choosing to receive promotional information), UMI may ask you to provide your name and contact details such as telephone number, postal address and email address.  UMI may also ask you for additional information including, but not limited to, your age and entertainment preferences (e.g. what type of music you prefer).</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p>You can refuse to provide UMI with the personal information that it requests from you.  However, if you do not provide UMI with the personal information it requests, UMI may not be able to provide you with our goods or services.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>If at any time you do not wish to be notified about goods, services or promotions offered by UMI, or if you do not wish to receive any further communications from UMI, you can opt-out of any, or all, UMI communications by directly contacting UMI. Details of how to contact UMI are set out in section 10 below.</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="privsub">3. How does UMI Collect Personal Information?</p>
		    <p>UMI collects personal information in a number of different ways.  The most common ways in which UMI collects personal information, and the purposes for which that information is collected, are as follows:</p>
		    <p><br>
	        </p>
            
            
            <ul>
			<li> Personal information is collected from artists and their agents, for the purpose of maintaining UMI's relationship with those individuals and performing its contractual obligations and responsibilities.</li>
			   <li>Personal information is collected from application forms (including on UMI websites) when individuals apply to become members of clubs run by UMI.  This information is collected for the purpose of providing news, information, offers and other services to members in accordance with the terms and conditions of the club.</li>
			   <li> Personal information is collected from competition entries and other promotions, for the purpose of running the competition or promotion and contacting the winner(s), and, if entrants/applicants do not tell UMI otherwise, for the purpose of sending information, news and offers in relation to our goods and services.</li>
			    <li>Personal information is collected from order forms when UMI's goods and services are ordered by distributors and retailers, for the purpose of fulfilling the order and delivering the goods, and to maintain its relationship with the individual concerned.  Personal information collected in this context may include credit, charge or debit card details.  If you provide this additional credit information it will only be used for the purposes of purchasing our goods or services. </li>
			   <li> Personal information is collected from online order forms when UMI’s goods or services are ordered by individuals, for the purpose of fulfilling the order and delivering the goods, and to maintain its relationship with the individual concerned.  Personal information collected in this context may include credit, charge or debit card details.</li>
			    <li> Personal information is collected from telephone, email, written and in-person enquiries directed to UMI, for the purpose of responding to the enquiries.</li>
			   <li>Personal information is collected from UMI's business contacts, including from contracts and business cards, when they enter into transactions with UMI or otherwise interact with UMI in a business context.</li>
			    <li>Personal information may be collected from UMI websites through automatic processes such as cookies, as discussed in section 9 below.
			    The remainder of this Policy focuses particularly on how UMI handles personal information about individuals who are consumers of our goods and services or who visit UMI websites.  However, as noted above, UMI also handles information about people who do not fall within these categories:</li>
			    <li> UMI handles personal information about artists (e.g. musicians, actors, directors, software programmers and graphic designers) whose work is published and/or distributed by the UMI.  Except where the Policy says otherwise, this personal information is generally handled in the same way as the personal information of consumers.</li>
			  <li>UMI also handles personal information about its business contacts (e.g. its suppliers, distributors and retailers).  How UMI handles the personal information of its business contacts is discussed in section 8 below.</li>
</ul>			  

<p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="privsub">4. Will Personal Information be Given to Anyone Else?</p>
			  <p>Generally, UMI will not disclose personal information to individuals or organisations outside UMI without your consent.  However, in the circumstances described below, personal information may be disclosed outside UMI.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>(a) Outsourcing</strong></em></p>
		    <p>From time to time, UMI may provide information to other companies within the Universal Group that perform certain functions on its behalf.  Any personal information transferred between Universal Group companies in such circumstances will be handled in accordance with the NPPs and this Policy.  UMI may also disclose personal information to third parties to whom it contracts out specialised functions (e.g. mailing houses, printing companies and event organisers).  For example, when UMI conducts a promotion, it may enter into a contractual arrangement with a mailing house, which will be subject to a contractual obligation to distribute on UMI's behalf information about its products, services or promotions.  If UMI does disclose personal information to third party contractors under outsourcing or contracting arrangements, UMI will take steps to ensure that those contractors:</p>
		    
            <ul>
		    <li>handle your personal information consistently with the NPPs (regardless of whether they are a small business, or would otherwise be exempt from the Privacy Act);</li>
	        <li>only use your personal information in order to provide the specific services or to perform the specific functions required by UMI; and</li>
		      <li>store your personal information securely, and only for as long as is necessary to provide the required services or perform the required functions.</li>
              </ul>
	
	<p>	    <strong><em>(b) Disclosures required or permitted by law</em></strong><em></em></p>
		    <p>UMI may also disclose personal information to individuals, corporations, organisations or governmental authorities without your consent if it is required to do so by law, or if the disclosure is permitted under any law or order of the Court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p><em><strong>(c) Disclosures to credit providers and credit-reporting agencies</strong></em></p>
			  <p>If you purchase our goods or services, UMI may disclose personal information to credit providers for credit related purposes such as credit-worthiness, credit rating, credit-reporting and fraud-checking.  If we disclose your personal information to credit providers you acknowledge that this information may be recorded on the credit information file that the external credit provider may maintain about you.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p><em><strong>(d) Transfer of personal information overseas</strong></em></p>
		    <p>From time to time UMI transfers personal information to overseas companies, both in the Universal Group and externally.  For example, this may occur in the course of booking overseas tours for artists contracted to UMI, or when we store personal information about customers, club members and competition entrants on servers that are hosted by a Universal Group or an external offshore company.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>If UMI does transfer your personal information overseas, we will take steps to ensure your personal information is given the same privacy protection in the destination country as it receives here in Australia.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p><em><strong>(e) Personal information that you communicate or publish via UMI websites</strong></em></p>
		    <p>UMI recommends that you do not publish or communicate personal information accessible to the public via UMI websites unless you want that information to be seen by others.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>Should you choose to publish or communicate personal information, or select features on UMI websites that allow you to display, publish or communicate personal information about yourself to the public via UMI websites, you acknowledge that UMI cannot control the use of such personal information by others. </p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="privsub">5. Access and Correction of Personal Information.</p>
			  <p>You generally have a right to seek access to the personal information that UMI holds about you and the purpose/s for which it is being held. </p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>You also have the right to ask UMI to correct personal information about you that you think is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>For legal and administrative reasons, UMI may also store records containing personal information in its archives.  You may seek access to the records held by UMI which are not current records, but if you do so, UMI may charge you for the cost of providing access.  It may also take UMI longer to respond to your request.  Please contact the Privacy Officer to discuss your requirements.</p>
		    <p>If you think that any of the personal information UMI holds about you is not accurate, complete or up to date, please provide UMI's Privacy Officer with your request for correction (contact details are set out in section 10 below).  It is UMI's policy to consider and respond to any requests for correction within 30 days of receiving the request.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>If UMI agrees that your personal information is not accurate, complete and up to date, UMI will correct it for you.  If it does not agree with your view, UMI will provide you with reasons for its view, and will provide you with an opportunity to make a statement of your view and have it included with the information.</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="privsub">6. Storage and Security of Personal Information.</p>
		    <p>UMI takes reasonable steps to protect the personal information it holds and controls from such risks as loss, misuse, unauthorised access, destruction, modification or disclosure.  The means of protection UMI uses includes, but is not limited to firewalls, password access, secure servers and encryption of credit card transactions.  UMI only allows authorised personnel to access personal information, and it is a condition of employment with UMI that its employees maintain the confidentiality of personal information.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>UMI cannot guarantee the security of online transactions and communications sent by electronic means or post.  You are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality and security of, and for all activities which occur under, any username and/or password assigned to you by UMI for the purpose of providing our goods or services and any purposes incidental to the provision of our goods and services (including without limitation any unauthorised use of your credit card).</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="privsub">7.  Destruction and de-identification of personal information</p>
			  <p>Unless a legal requirement requires otherwise, if UMI no longer requires the personal information it has collected from you for the purpose for which it was collected, it will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify your personal information.</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="privsub">8. Business contact information.</p>
		    <p>UMI collects a range of personal information about individuals from its business dealings with them, and with the organisations they work for. UMI's policy is to only use and disclose this business contact information for purposes related to the business context in which the information was collected.<br>
		    </p>
		    <p>&nbsp; </p>
			  <p>Individuals are entitled to access and request correction of personal information held about them in their business capacity (see section 5 above).</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="privsub">9. Online Privacy Issues.</p>
			  <p>UMI will apply this policy to all personal information it handles, whether collected online or otherwise.  To the extent that this Policy applies to online privacy issues, it is to be read as forming part of the terms of use for UMI websites.  This section 9 is intended to provide more information about privacy for the users of UMI websites.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p><strong><em>(a) Online collection of personal and non-personal information</em></strong></p>
		    <p>As outlined in section 3 above, UMI collects personal information through UMI websites when you sign up to join one of its clubs or when you contact UMI through its online enquiry forms.<br>
			    <br>
			  </p>
		    <p>UMI websites may also collect other information that may or may not be personal information.  Each time you visit a UMI website, its server automatically recognises and stores your "address" (e.g. your domain name or internet protocol address), the type of internet browser you are using, the address of the site that "referred" you to UMI websites and clickstream data.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>In addition, UMI websites use cookies to track usage of its websites.  Most web browsers are set by default to accept cookies.  However, if you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to either prompt or refuse cookies.  Please note that rejecting cookies may mean that not all the functions on the UMI websites you visit will be  available to you.  UMI uses cookies for tracking the statistics of its websites.  This allows UMI to better understand its users and improve the layout and functionality of its websites.  This tracking is conducted in such a way as to ensure the anonymity of visitors to UMI websites.  While the cookie may identify your computer, it should not identify you.<br>
		    </p>
		    <p>&nbsp; </p>
		    <p><em><strong>(b) Links to other websites</strong></em></p>
			  <p>Sometimes UMI websites contain links to third party websites for your convenience and information.  You should be aware that when you access a non-UMI website, UMI is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of that site.  UMI suggests that you review the privacy policy of each site you visit, especially if you intend to provide any personal information via the site.</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="privsub">10. How to Contact UMI.</p>
		    <p>If you have any questions or comments about this privacy policy, if you wish to access any personal information UMI holds about you, or if you wish to make a complaint about how UMI has handled personal information about you, please contact UMI's Privacy Officer (who is the Head of Human Resources) by one of the following methods:<br>
