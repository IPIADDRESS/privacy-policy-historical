<li><p>In addition, if you are a resident of the European Economic Area, you can <strong>object to processing</strong> of your personal information, ask us to <strong>restrict processing</strong> of your personal information or <strong>request portability</strong> of your personal information. To exercise these rights email <a href="mailto:privacy@getfeedback.com">privacy@getfeedback.com</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can <strong>opt out of receiving promotional emails</strong> from us by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in the email, by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@getfeedback.com">privacy@getfeedback.com</a>.  If you choose to no longer receive marketing information, we may still communicate with you regarding such things as your security updates, product functionality, responses to service requests, or other transactional, non-marketing/administrative related purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>If we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p></li>
<li><p>You have the <strong>right to complain to a data protection authority</strong> about our collection and use of your personal information.  For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area ("<strong>EEA</strong>"), are available <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm">here</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that because most of the information we store can only identify a particular browser or device, and cannot identify you individually, you will need to provide us with some additional information to enable us to identify the personal information we hold about you and ensure that accurately fulfil your request. You may also be required to provide ID.</p>

<p><strong>Further Information for Respondents:</strong>  As described in this Notice, for much of the personal information we collect and process about you through the Services, we act as a processor on behalf of our Customers. In such cases, if you want to exercise any data protection rights that may be available to you under applicable law or have questions or concerns about how your personal information is handled by GetFeedback as a processor on behalf of our Customers, you should contact the relevant Customer that has contracted with GetFeedback for use of the Services, and refer to their separate privacy policies. If you are having difficulties finding this Customer, you can contact us through our support team and we will try our best to help you.</p>

<h4>4.2 Legal basis for processing personal information (EEA only)</h4>

<p>If you are resident in or a visitor from European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.  In most cases we use personal information where the processing is in our legitimate business interests, or where we need it to perform a contract with you.  In some cases, we may ask for your consent or have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.</p>

<p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to enter into a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). Where we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests, our legitimate interests will generally include processing your personal information: (i) to understand how our visitors use, and how we may improve, our Website; (ii) for our marketing activities (in accordance with your marketing preferences); and (iii) measuring the effectiveness of our marketing and promotional campaigns.</p>

<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, including any legitimate interests relied upon, please contact us using the contact details provided under the <a href="#four-seven">“Contact Us”</a> heading below.</p>

<h4>4.3 Third-Party Websites and Apps</h4>

<p>This Notice only applies to the GetFeedback Site and Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or disclosures of third parties that use or access the GetFeedback Site or Services. In addition, the Site or Service may contain links to third-party websites and apps. Any access to and use of such linked websites or apps is not governed by this Notice, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third parties.</p>

<p><a class="page-anchor" name="four-four"></a></p>

<h4>4.4 How do we keep your personal information secure?</h4>

<p>We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect any personal information we process against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, to protect your information, our credit card processing vendor uses the latest Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology for secure transactions. Our vendor has been audited by a PCI-certified auditor and is certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1. This is the most stringent level of certification available in the payments industry.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, nobody is truly and completely safe from hackers. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee security, no Internet transmission can ever be guaranteed 100% secure, and so we encourage you to take care when disclosing personal information online and to use readily available tools, such as Internet firewalls, secure e-mail and similar technologies to protect yourself online.</p>

<p><a class="page-anchor" name="four-five"></a></p>

<h4>4.5 International Data Transfers</h4>

<p>The Website and the Services are provided, supported, and hosted in the United States. If you are using the Website or Services from outside the United States, be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information, in the United States and Finland. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.</p>

<p>However, we have taken appropriate measures to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Notice and have implemented appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners. Further details can be provided upon request.</p>
