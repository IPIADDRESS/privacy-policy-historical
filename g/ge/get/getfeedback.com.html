<h2>SURVEY CREATORS</h2>

<h3>Information We Collect</h3>

<p>We collect information directly from you when you submit it in connection with our Services. Some of this information allows you to be personally identified (such as your name, email address, payment information, etc. which is provided in order to open an account) (“<strong>personal information</strong>”). Other information you provide is the content to be included as part of your survey (“<strong>survey content</strong>”).</p>

<p>We also collect usage information automatically when you use our Services. This includes what webpages you visit on our site, what you click on, as well as device information such as your IP address, operating system, and browser type and version. Like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers and those log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses. We may also access metadata and other information associated with files that you upload into our Services, such as images. If you arrive on our Site from an external source (such as a link on another website or in an email), we record information about the source that referred you to us.</p>

<p>The technologies we use for automatic information collection may include cookies and web beacons. A cookie is a small file placed on your computer or smartphone.

<p>In the following limited situations, we may disclose information that we collect or that you provide to us:</p>

<ul>
<li>To our contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business and who are obligated to keep personal information conﬁdential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.</li>

<h2>SURVEY TAKERS</h2>

<h3>Information We Collect About Survey Takers</h3>

<p>When someone responds to a survey created with our Services, we collect, on behalf and upon instructions of survey creators, survey responses as well as information relating to the survey taker and his/her use of our Services. </p>

<p>We collect usage information automatically when the survey taker uses our Services. This includes device information such as the survey taker’s IP address, operating system, and browser type. Like most websites today, our web servers keep log ﬁles that record data each time a device accesses those servers and those log ﬁles contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses. If the survey taker arrives on our website, we record information about the source that referred the survey taker to us.</p>

<p>The technologies we use for automatic information collection may include cookies. A cookie is a small ﬁle placed on the survey taker’s computer or smartphone. We use cookies to record current session information, but do not require permanent cookies. The survey taker can choose to refuse or disable cookies from their browser or the settings on their smartphone but this may adversely impact the survey taker’s ability to use our Services.</p>

<p>Our Services may contain small electronic ﬁles known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages and for other related statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain content on our Services and verifying system and server integrity).</p>

<p>In addition, certain third parties, such as analytics companies, may use automatic information collection technologies to collect information about survey takers when they use our Services. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites, apps and other online services websites.</p>

<h3>How We Use Survey Taker Information</h3>

<p>Survey responses are owned and managed by the survey creator. To understand how survey creators will use survey responses, survey takers would need to contact the survey creator directly.</p>

<p>We only use information that we collect about or from survey takers, including any personal information, to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Improve our Services and resolve technical issues.</li>
<li>Provide customer support.</li>
<li>Fulﬁll any other purpose for which you provide it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When Survey Taker Information is Shared or Disclosed</h3>

<p>Survey responses are disclosed to the survey creator and, as mentioned above, such responses are owned and managed by the survey creator. </p>

<p>We host surveys but the survey creators control how surveys are sent out and what is done with the information received. Survey takers should contact the survey creator to understand what will be done with survey responses and whether responses are received anonymously or whether the survey was sent out in a manner that allows the survey creator to link the response with an email address. </p>

<p>In the following limited situations, we may disclose survey taker information to someone other than the survey creator:</p>

<ul>
<li>To our contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business and who are obligated to keep personal information conﬁdential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.</li>
<li>In an aggregated or anonymized format where no individual can be identiﬁed or linked to any part of the information.</li>
<li>To comply with any court order, law or legal process, including responding to a governmental or regulatory request.</li>
<li>To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, sale or transfer of some or all of GetFeedback, Inc.’s assets.</li>
<li>For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.</li>
<li>With your consent</li>
</ul>
