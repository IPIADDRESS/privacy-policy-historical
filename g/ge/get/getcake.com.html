<h3 style="padding-top: 24px;">How Is Data Secured?</h3>
<p>We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving personal data. We also have appropriate security measures to protect against loss, misuse or alteration of information that we collect from you.</p>
<p>We operate a policy of “privacy by design” by looking for opportunities to minimise the amount of personal information we hold about you. We use appropriate technological and operational security measures to protect your information against any unauthorised access or unlawful use, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>ensuring the physical security of our offices, or other sites;</li>
<li>ensuring the physical and digital security of our equipment and devices by using appropriate password protection and encryption;</li>
<li>maintaining an internal data protection policy for, and delivering data protection training to, our employees; and</li>
<li>limiting access to your personal information to those in our company who need to use it in the course of their work.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="howLong"></a></p>
<h3 style="padding-top: 24px;">How Long Is Data Kept For?</h3>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as is necessary to provide you with the services that you have requested from us or for as long as we reasonably require to retain the information for our lawful business purposes (such as for the purposes of exercising our legal rights), or for as long as the law otherwise permits.</p>
<p>We operate a data retention policy and look to find ways to reduce the amount of information we hold about you and the length of time that we need to keep it.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>Please contact us using the information provided in the ‘About us’ section above if you would like to obtain details of our retention periods for different aspects of your personal data.<a name="rights"></a></p>
<h3 style="padding-top: 24px;">What Rights Do I Have?</h3>
<p><strong>Your rights</strong></p>
<p>You have certain rights in respect of the information that we hold about you, including:</p>

<li>the right to ask us <strong>not to process your personal data for marketing purposes</strong>;</li>
<li>the right to <strong>request access</strong>to the information that we hold about you;</li>
<li>in certain circumstances, the right to <strong>object to processing</strong>, i.e. to ask us to stop processing information about you; and</li>
<li>the <strong>right to lodge a complaint</strong>about us to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (https://ico.org.uk/).</li>
</ol>
<p>From 25 May 2018, you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p>Please note that we may need to retain certain information for our own record-keeping and research purposes. We may also need to send you service-related communications relating to your website user account even when you have requested not to receive marketing communications.<a name="yourFutureRights"></a></p>

<li>the right to ask us to <strong>limit or cease processing</strong>or <strong>erase information</strong>we hold about you in certain circumstances.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="exerciseRights"></a><br>

<p>You may exercise your rights above by contacting us using the details set out at the top of this Privacy Policy in the ‘About us’ section, or in the case of preventing processing for marketing activities also by checking certain boxes on forms that we use to collect your data to tell us that you don’t want to be involved in marketing, by using the unsubscribe option available on email communication your receive from us, or by updating your marketing preferences via your account with us.</p>
<p>We will comply with your requests unless we have a lawful reason not to do so.<a name="changesUpdates"></a></p>

You agree that if the matter remains unresolved for forty-five (45) days after notification (via certified mail or personal delivery) that a dispute exists, all parties shall join in mediation services in Orange County, California with a mutually agreed mediator in an attempt to resolve the dispute.
