        <h1 id="magic-inc-s-privacy-policy">Magic Inc.'s Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Magic, Inc. ("Magic," "we," "our," or "us") is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to the Magic website, getmagic.com and getmagicnow.com, and our mobile service (collectively, our "Service"), and describes how we collect, protect, use and share information gathered about you on our websites.  By using our Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, and our <a href="/aup">Acceptable Use Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<h3 id="1-information-we-collect">1.  INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
<p>Categories of personal information we collect can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information you provide to us directly. Magic collects personally identifiable information on the Service when you interact with us, such as when you engage with the Magic Service through your mobile device or interact with our website. The personal information we collect may include your name, mobile number, mailing address, email address, date of birth, and any other information necessary to fulfill your request. You should feel free to decline to provide any information that we request, however, please note that doing so may make it impossible for Magic to fulfill your request. We use the information that we collect to provide the products or services that you request, to improve and customize our Service, and to contact you about special promotions and new products. We also receive personally identifiable information when you apply for a job in the "employment" section of the website. Any such information gathered through that section will be used solely to evaluate whether your background and experience make you a candidate for a career with Magic.</li>
<li>Information We Collect from Third Parties. We may collect information about you from the parties and services that we engage to provide your requests. We may also collect information about you from third party services and from publicly available sources. For example, we may receive information about you when you interact with our site through various social media, for example, by liking us on Facebook or following us on Twitter or by logging in to our service through Facebook, Twitter or any other third party login. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our website.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-how-we-use-cookies-and-other-tracking-technology-to-collect-information">2.  HOW WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGY TO COLLECT INFORMATION</h3>
<p>Pixel Tags and Cookies</p>
<p>We and our third party partners may automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our website or use our Service. For instance, when you visit our website, we may send one or more cookies—a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters—to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use our website (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click, how frequently you access our website, and other actions you take on our website), and allow us to track your usage of the Service over time. We may collect log file information about your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. Log file information may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, information about your mobile device, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on our website, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of our website.</p>
<p>We also use an email delivery and marketing company to send emails. Pixel tags and cookies are used in those email messages and at our website to help us measure the effectiveness of our marketing and how visitors use our site.  Pixel tags (sometimes also called "clear GIFs") are small graphic files, invisible to the human eye, which allow websites or other online services to track users. Magic and our third-party advertising company use pixel tags in HTML-enabled email to track whether (and when) the recipient opened the message.</p>
<p>We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for our website.  These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit, your use of third party applications, and other information that assists us in analyzing and improving our website. When you access our website by or through a mobile device, we may receive or collect and store a unique identification number associated with your device (for example, a UDID, IDFA, Google Advertising ID or similar), mobile carrier, device type and manufacturer, and phone number.</p>
<p>We may use the data collected through cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and pixel tags to:  (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it the next time you use our Service; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including advertising; (c) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our website and our email communications; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our website; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (f) otherwise to plan for and enhance our website. The information we collect through these tracking technologies may be linked to the Personal Information you have chosen to share with us when you register.</p>
<h3 id="third-party-tracking-and-online-advertising">Third Party Tracking and Online Advertising</h3>
<p>We permit third party online advertising networks to collect information about your use of our website over time so that they may play or display ads that may be relevant to your interests on our website as well as on other websites or services.  Typically, the information is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies.  You may "opt out" of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology by managing the preferences or settings on your browser or mobile device.  However, if you decide not to accept our cookies, your ability to use some features on our site may be impaired.  Please refer to your browser's or mobile device's technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools.  (To learn more about cookies, clear gifs/web beacons and related technologies and how you may opt-out of some of this tracking, you may wish to visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and/or the Network Advertising Initiative's online resources, at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>).  We are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals sent by your browser at this time.  Depending on your mobile device, you may not be able to control tracking technologies through settings.  If you have any questions about opting out of the collection of cookies and other tracking/recording tools, you can contact us directly at <a href="mailto:contact@getmagic.com">contact@getmagic.com</a>.</p>

<p>In order to provide our Service, it is necessary for us to share your information with third parties (such as restaurants, travel agencies, retail merchants, etc) who help us provide our Services to you.
