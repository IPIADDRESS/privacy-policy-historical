		<p>Effective Date: October 23, 2009.</p>
        <p>This privacy statement (this "Policy") covers the website <a href="http://www.getthejob.com">http://www.getthejob.com</a> 
        (the "Site") and is applicable to all information about you ("you") collected through the Site ("User Information").
        </p>
        <p>In this Policy, Avenue100 Media Solutions Inc., the owner of the Site, ("Avenue100," "we," "us," or "our") describes the types of 
           information that Avenue100 gathers from you and the other people who visit the Site (the "Users") and how we may use 
           that User Information. By providing any information, you agree to our use of that information consistent with this Policy.
        </p>
        <p>Please read this Policy carefully before providing us with any User Information.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Personally Identifiable User Information</h3>
        <p>Avenue100 may require that you register and provide us with various types of personally identifiable User Information 
           through the Site. For example, you may choose to provide us your personally identifiable User Information, including, 
           but not limited to, your name, mailing address, cell phone number and email address. We may store a cookie file on your 
           hard drive so that our systems will recognize you each time you visit the Site. In that way, we can save your preferences 
           from visit to visit and present you with a customized version of the Site without requiring you to log into the Site every 
           time you visit. We may store your personally identifiable information in our systems for use in other ways as described in 
           this Policy.</p>
        <p>In order for you to take full advantage of the Site, we encourage you to provide your personally identifiable User 
           Information to us. Providing your personally identifiable User Information is, however, voluntary. You may choose not to 
           provide us with your personally identifiable User Information by simply not entering it on the Site. While you will still 
           have access to the Site even if you do not provide us with your personally identifiable User Information, you should understand 
           that you will not be able to use certain services or features available through the Site that require you to enter your 
           personally identifiable User Information in order to function.  For example, we offer a service that sends an automated 
           text message to your cell phone when a job comes through that matches you profile so that you can act swiftly.  If you don't 
           provide us with your cell phone number, you will not have the advantage of the speedy notice.</p>
        <p>If you do not register, then the User Information we collect from you is limited. For example, we log your IP address 
           in order to help us to diagnose problems with our server, administer the Site and track usage statistics. Your IP address 
           may vary each time you visit, or it may be the same, depending on whether you access the Site through an always-on type of 
           Internet connection (such as cable or DSL), or through a dial-up connection. Either way, it would be very difficult for us 
           to personally identify you through your IP address. If you reached the Site by clicking on a link or ad from another web site, 
           then we may also log that User Information. This helps us to maximize our Internet exposure and to understand the interests 
           of our Users. All of this User Information is collected and used only in aggregated form; that is, it is entered into our 
           database, where we can use it to generate overall anonymous reports on our Users.</p>
           
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>We may place a small file known as a "cookie" on your computer's hard drive. A cookie may contain information that allows 
           us to track your path through the Site and to determine whether you have visited us before. The cookie itself never contains 
           your personally identifiable User Information. However, if you provide us with personally identifiable User Information, 
           the cookie may allow us to personally identify you if you return to the site again. Our cookies cannot be used to read data 
           from your hard drive and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by other websites. We use cookies in 
           this manner to help us understand how Users use the Site, and to help us to improve the Site. From time to time, we may place 
           cookies in connection with third party advertisements. You may refuse to accept a cookie from us by following the procedures 
           for rejecting cookies specific to your web browser. Although you may do so, you may find that your browser reacts strangely when 
           visiting not only the Site, but other web sites as well.</p>
           
        <h3>Clear Gifs</h3>
        <p>We also employ a software technology called "clear gifs," which helps us better manage content on the Site by informing 
           us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers, similar in function to cookies, and are used 
           to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs 
           are embedded invisibly on web sites and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the User
            Information gathered by clear gifs to Users' personally identifiable User Information. Clear gifs may also be used by our third 
            party advertisers.</p>
        <p>In addition to the User Information that you provide to Us or that We obtain about you from your use of our Site, We may also 
           augment the data We have collected with other aggregate information from other online or offline sources.</p>
        <p>If you visit this Site by "clicking through" from another web site, and you have registered with that other web site, 
           then certain information about you that you provided to that other website, such as the terms you were searching on that
           led you to the Site, may be transmitted to us and we may use it. You should review the privacy policy of any web site 
           from which you reached the Site in order to determine what information was collected by that web site and for what purpose(s)
           you agreed that web site could use that information. We may or may not retain that information; if we do, then we will only use 
           it in accordance with this Policy.</p>
 
        <h3>Avenue100 Policy Regarding Children Under the Age of 13</h3>
        <p>The Site is not intended for children under the age of 13, and Avenue100 does not knowingly collect or use personally 
           identifiable User Information from children under the age of 13.</p>
           
        <h3>How We Use The User Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>User Information collected from you helps both of us. Either third party providers or us may use the User Information we collect to:</p>
        <div style="padding-left:20px;padding-bottom:5px;font-size:0.9em"><ul>
            <li>Make your next visit to the Site more personalized</li>	
            <li>Contact you regarding administrative issues such as questions about your specific request</li>	
            <li>Send text messages to your cell phone about jobs that match your profile</li>	
            <li>Compile anonymous statistical information for analysis</li>	
            <li>Provide aggregated anonymous information to third parties</li>	
            <li>Make telephone calls to you with information and offers</li>	
            <li>Mail information and offers to you</li>	
            <li>Email information and offers to you</li>	
            <li>Present relevant information</li>	
        </ul></div>
        <p>We will not share your cell phone number with third parties or use the number except to send you job alerts.</p>
         
        <h3>Consent to the Use of Third Party Providers</h3>
        <p>Please understand that Avenue100 may contract with other third parties to provide various services to Avenue100 relating 
           to the Site on an outsourced basis rather than performing the services ourselves. For example, we may contract with an email provider 
           to handle the distribution of email messages to Users of the Site. Likewise, we may contract with a web site hosting provider to host 
           the Site for us. By visiting the Site, all Users consent to Avenue100 providing all User Information (whether or not personally 
           identifiable) received or collected from those Users to such third party providers for the purpose of enabling the third party provider 
           to provide these outsourced services to us.   On an occasion we may use certain directory information that we have collected to 
           send you information about products and services, or updates and other information we think may be of interest to you. We may 
           permit a third-party to use non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our site in order to provide advertisements 
           about goods and services that may be of interest to you through the use of cookies, web beacons, clear GIF, pixel tags web bugs, 
           action tags, or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements' 
           effectiveness.</p>
         <p>In addition, all Users consent to the collection, maintenance, and processing of their User Information (whether or not personally 
            identifiable) by Avenue100 and these third party providers. Third parties will protect your information as Avenue100 would 
            under the terms of this policy.</p>

         <h3>Opting Out</h3>
         <p>This privacy statement describes Avenue100's potential uses of your information. If you do not agree to our potential uses of your 
            personally identifiable information as we have described for you, you are not required to provide that information to us. In addition, 
            you may opt out of receiving advertising and promotional emails from us simply by responding to the opt-out email link provided on 
            all email communications from Avenue100. You are not able to opt out of receiving administrative emails from us.</p>
         <p>You also may cancel or correct your personal information at any time. You can do this by e-mailing us at myinfo@getthejob.com 
            with your User Name and the notice "My User Information" in the subject field of the e-mail. We will send you an e-mail to confirm 
            your request. After we receive confirmation from you, we will correct or remove your information from the active database, but some 
            information may remain in our archives.</p>

        <h3>Surveys &amp; Contests</h3>
        <p>From time to time our Site may request information from Users via emailed surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or 
           contests is completely voluntary and the User therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose personally identifiable User Information. 
           The requested User Information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information 
           (such as zip code). Contact User Information will be shared with the contest or survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes. 
           Survey User Information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Site. Though we may use an 
           intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, these intermediaries will not use the Users' personally identifiable User Information 
           for any secondary purposes. You may opt out of receiving emailed surveys or contests from us simply by responding to the opt-out email 
           link provided on all email communications from us.</p>
 
        <h3>Other Web Sites; Links</h3>
        <p>Please be aware that Avenue100's affiliates, promotional partners, advertisers, sponsors, and other third-party web sites accessible 
           through the Site may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. Avenue100 is not responsible for any actions, 
           content of web sites or privacy policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties 
           when providing personally identifiable information through linked web sites.</p>

        <h3>Disclosure of Your User Information</h3>
        <p>As you might expect, Avenue100 must cooperate with legal authorities, and may in some circumstances be required to disclose User 
           Information (including personally identifiable User Information) in response to requests from law enforcement authorities, or in 
           response to a subpoena or other legal process. We don't expect this to happen, but if it does, we will provide only the User 
           Information required. We can also turn over User Information about you if we believe we must in order to prevent a violation of 
           the law, and by accepting this Policy, you consent to our right to do so, in our sole discretion. You also consent to our disclosing 
           User Information about you in the course of legal proceedings if we believe we are legally required to do so, if we reasonably believe 
           that doing so may mitigate our liability, or if doing so will assist us in enforcing our legal rights.</p>
        <p>At some point, Avenue100 may establish subsidiaries or other related companies, or merge with or be acquired by another company. 
           When that happens, then we may disclose to them your User Information, in which case we will request them to abide by this Policy. 
           We may also disclose some User Information to a potential acquirer, although such disclosure would be subject to normal and customary 
           requirements. If and when such a merger or acquisition takes place, we will notify you by publishing a public announcement on our Site.</p>
        <p>Of course, Avenue100 will take reasonable measures to secure the User Information Users provide to us, using industry-standard methods. 
           All User Information is protected by password and accessible only to authorized Avenue100 personnel. However, there is a remote 
           possibility that Internet transmissions containing a User's personally identifiable User Information may be intercepted by others. 
           There is no way for us to ensure the privacy of User Information before it arrives at the Site or after it leaves the Site.</p>
        
        <h3>About the Policy</h3>
