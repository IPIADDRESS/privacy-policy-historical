<h3>E.U. Safe Harbor</h3>

<h3>Types of information we collect</h3>

<p>Information is collected from you primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services.  Get The World Moving collects anonymous and personal information (i.e. information which might enable you to be identified, such as your name, e-mail address or postal address).  Depending on the service you are accessing, you could be asked to provide information such as your name, email address, mailing address, phone number or information about what you like and do not like. Get The World Moving will only collect personal information when you provide it to us. Sometimes, we may specifically ask for personal information about you when you sign up to use a service through this Website. Certain information may be required such as your gender, age range, internet address or screen name, billing address, type of computer and information about your employer such as company name, address and business type in order to provide that service or product to you. This information may also be used to inform you of additional products and services which may interest you. You can choose not to receive such information when you are undertaking product or service registration on this Website or opt-out of such communications later (See “opt-out” disclosure below). We may also ask about your interests, but it is your choice whether to respond.</p>

<h3>Collection of 3rd party information</h3>

<p>As a registered user, you have the ability to add the personal information of 3rd party individuals into our system for invitational and registration purposes.  Get The World Moving will use this information to contact them for that express purpose only.  These individuals may contact us at <a href="mailto:enquiry@gettheworldmoving.com">enquiry@gettheworldmoving.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

<h3>How we use your information</h3>

<p>Get The World Moving will only use the personal information you have chosen to provide us for the purpose for which you provided it. Get The World Moving will not use it for any other purpose without your consent.  We may use your personal information to:  fulfill your registration, send you an order confirmation, send you requested service information, respond to customer service requests, administer your account, send you a newsletter, send you marketing communications, administer contests you entered, and notify you if you won, improve our Website and marketing efforts, and display content based upon your interests.</p>

<h3>Anonymous information</h3>

<p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyse trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site, to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole and report aggregated data to our advertisers.  We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>

<h3>Disclosure of your information</h3>

<p>We will not, without your consent, sell or otherwise provide your personal information to a third party, or make any other use of your personal information, for any purpose which is not incidental to your use of the Website. Unless in using the Website you expressly or impliedly agree to make certain information available, all personal information which we collect is kept confidential to the best of our ability, subject to the other terms and conditions of this privacy policy.  In addition, our employees and contractors who provide services related to our Website are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by us. Our employed staff and contractors engaged by us may have access to personal information that you provide and may access it for purposes that include the audit of content on the Website for quality control purposes and for compliance with our Website <a href="/terms">Terms and Conditions</a>. </p>

<h3>Access to your personal information</h3>

<p>If your personal information changes, you may correct, update, amend, ask to have it removed from a public forum, directory or testimonial on our site or deactivate it by making the change on your member settings page, by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:customerservice@gettheworldmoving.com">customerservice@gettheworldmoving.com</a> or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.  If you no longer desire our service, please contact customer service.  We will respond to your request to within 30 days.
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<h3>Opt out preferences</h3>

<p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter and other communications, we will use your name and email address to send those communications to you.  Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing the email preferences in your account settings page or you can contact us at <a href="mailto:enquiry@gettheworldmoving.com">enquiry@gettheworldmoving.com</a>.</p> 

<p>We may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site.  If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information and demographic information (such as zip code / post code).  We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>

<h3>Tracking technologies</h3>

<p>This Website currently uses cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. One of the reasons for using cookies is to identify the total number of users of a site and measure traffic patterns for research purposes. Cookies may also be used by sites that offer personalised or customised content so that a user’s preferences can be "remembered" when they return to the site.</p>

<p>Get The World Moving may collect information via cookies. If Get The World Moving collects personal information via cookies, then that personal information will be dealt with by Get The World Moving in accordance with this privacy policy. In other words, information collected via cookies will be treated in the same way as any other information.  You can remove cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory.  If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited. </p>

<p>We also employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other 3rd party assets (such as social media) on the site is not covered by our privacy policy.  These 3rd parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our site.  We do not have access or control over these technologies.  We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personally identifiable information.</p>

<h3>Behavioural Advertising</h3>

<p>We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Website or to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.  Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

<h3>Protection of personal information</h3>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. Where utilised for the purpose of transactions, the Website uses a login process to promote the security of usernames and passwords.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) or log-in credentials, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). The Website’s servers are located in a secured data centre with security measures in place. </p>
