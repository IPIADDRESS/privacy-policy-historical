<p>By providing personal information to us, and by submitting personal information through the Website, you signify your consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy.&nbsp; By submitting your information via our website or one of our partners, and requesting information or a quote or free report from us, you acknowledge and agree that a provider may contact you using your information to provide your requested quote or to obtain additional information needed to provide your requested quotes where permitted by law. In the event that we do not have a provider, your information may be shared with another company that will provide this same or related services. This company may have several providers contact you at their discretion. We are not responsible, and shall not be held liable, if a Provider or other third party to whom we have forwarded any of the information you submitted to us violates our Privacy Policy or such third party’s own privacy policy (if any), or otherwise violates the law.</p>
<p>The United States federal private sector privacy legislation, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and the protection of personal information in the private sector, are the basis for Zenect’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>For purposes of this privacy policy, “personal information” shall mean any information that can identify an individual directly or through other reasonably available means.</p>

To that end, we have designated a Privacy Officer, to be accountable for compliance with the Principles and this privacy policy. Please see Principle 10, below, to obtain the contact information for our Privacy Officer.</p>

<p>Please be aware that any information that is publicly posted throughout the Website can be accessed by every visitor of the Website.</p>
<p>How We Collect Your Personal Information?:</p>
<p>We may gather personal information from you in person, over the telephone or by corresponding with you via mail, facsimile or the Internet. We also collect personal information from Users when Users register their profile, view items throughout the Website, complete online order forms and carry out transactions through use of our Website.</p>
<p>Personal Information Collected via Technology:</p>
<p>As you navigate the Website, certain non-personal information may be passively collected and stored on our Internet server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on the Website you clicked. This type of information is collected to make our services and solutions more useful to you and to tailor your experience on the Website to meet your special interests and needs.</p>
<p>What are Cookies: Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s computer hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies make using the Website easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you. These cookies are restricted for use only on our Website, and do not transfer any personal information to any other party. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies; however, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. (Note: you will need to consult the help area of your browser application for instructions.) If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept a cookie, some parts of the Website will not function properly or may be considerably slower.</p>
<p>What are IP Addresses: An IP address is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet provider whenever you’re surfing the Internet. When you request pages from the Website, our servers log your IP address. Zenect collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of the Website. &nbsp;We may use your IP addresses in cooperation with your Internet provider to identify you if we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the law, our Terms of Use or to protect our service, Website, Users, or others. Other third parties may place advertisements and cookies on webpages within the Website. Other companies’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.</p>
<p>Principle 5 – Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention</p>
<p>We will only use or disclose your personal information in accordance with the purposes for which it was originally collected unless you have otherwise consented, or when it is required or permitted by law. We will retain your personal information only for so long as is required to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected or as required by law.</p>
