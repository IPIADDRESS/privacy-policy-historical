<strong>5. What is Co-Registration?</strong><br>
a. AdvertiseOut.com  and our affiliated sites signup pages may contain co-registration checkboxes, where Users can choose to co-registration for other Web Sites during their registration with AdvertiseOut.com  and our affiliated sites by accepting or by checking the checkbox next to the co-registration Offer. Users are not required to keep selected any co-registration boxes to join AdvertiseOut.com  and our affiliated sites; however, they may be required to do so in order to qualify for promotions.</p>
<p><strong>6. How Do We Share Co-Registration Information?</strong><br>
a. When a User co-registers for an Offer by checking, or leaving checked, the co-registration checkbox, any information they provide to AdvertiseOut.com  and our affiliated sites may be shared with the Advertiser, partner of affiliate associated with the co-registration Offer. AdvertiseOut.com  and our affiliated sites cannot control what Advertisers subsequently do with that information.</p>
<p>Co-Registration Privacy Policy:  Under no circumstance will we ever pass any of your information along to anyone unless you specifically request us to do so by selecting or leaving selected the check box next to an offer on our co-registration platform or offer pages and submitting the form. AdvertiseOut.com  provides a simple and hassle-free “opt-out” link that lets you conveniently unsubscribe from future emails and offers. AdvertiseOut.com  and our affiliated sites cannot control what Advertisers subsequently do with that information.</p>
<p>Co-Registration Data Use Policy  for the opt-in offers served served by AdvertiseOut.com .</p>
<p>Below we explain exactly how your data may be used with regard to our co-reg offer (advertising) pages.</p>
<p>In order to target the offers on advertising pages appropriately, the publisher, in accordance with its Privacy Policy, may have passed some of your non-personally identifiable, previously-entered, information such as zip code, gender, age etc., to AdvertiseOut.com .  AdvertiseOut.com  does not know any of your personally identifiable information.  If and only if you confirm the selection of each offer on this page by agreeing to and claiming the opt-in on the associated offer button (Opt-In Button), and then submitting , will AdvertiseOut.com  be passed your personally identifiable information by the web publisher.</p>
<p>The 2 ways your personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information can be collected are: 1) by the web publisher who’s site you are currently visiting and 2) by entering data on this page directly related to this offer.</p>
<p>For each offer you chose to opt-in to, your personally identifiable information will be passed to AdvertiseOut.com  and AdvertiseOut.com  will in turn pass it to the corresponding advertiser, along with your non-personally identifiable information. In accordance with each advertiser’s Privacy Policy (see advertiser’s unique offer associated website Privacy Policy for details) The advertiser may then chose to reach out and communicate with you directly.  All AdvertiseOut.com  advertisers are required under contract to have an unsubscribe mechanism.</p>
