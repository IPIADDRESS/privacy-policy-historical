						<p><b>E-Cards</b><br>
						Some pages on this site allow you to send free e-cards to a friend. E-cards are sent as links to a Getty.edu Web page. We do not save, use, or sell senders' or recipients' names or e-mail addresses.</p>
						<p><b>Getty Bookmarks</b><br>
						To use the Getty Bookmark feature, you need to create an online account. Your e-mail address is used to identify your account and the associated bookmarks.

						<p>We use cookies to administer your online account(s). However, we do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information.</p>
						<p>If you choose to e-mail Getty Bookmarks to a friend, we will ask you for your friend's e-mail address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time e-mail containing your bookmarks, but we will not store his or her e-mail address or use it for any other purpose.</p>
						<p>You may review or change the password(s) for your online account(s) at any time. Log in to Getty Bookmarks and click "Edit Profile" to choose a new password.</p>
