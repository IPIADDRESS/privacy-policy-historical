        <li>1.1 <strong>Basis of sale</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>(a)	We consider these Terms and the Order to set out the whole agreement between you and us for the supply of the Services. These Terms only apply to our contracts with consumers.</li>
            <li>(b)	Please check that the details in these Terms and on the Order are complete and accurate before you commit yourself to the contract. If you think that there is a mistake, please make sure that you ask us to confirm any changes in writing, as we only accept responsibility for statements and representations made in writing by our authorised employees and agents.</li>
            <li>(c)	Please ensure that you read and understand these Terms before you submit the Order, because you will be bound by the Terms once a contract comes into existence between us, in accordance with clause 1.4.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>1.1	Any samples, drawings, descriptions or advertising we issue, and any descriptions or illustrations contained in our catalogues or brochures, are issued or published solely to provide you with an approximate idea of the Services they describe. They do not form part of the contract between you and us or any other contract between you and us for the supply of the Services.</li>
        <li>1.2	If any of these Terms are inconsistent with any term of the Order, the Order shall prevail.</li>
        <li>1.3	The Order is an offer by you to enter into a binding contract with us, which we are free to accept or decline at our absolute discretion.</li>
        <li>1.4	These Terms shall become binding on you and us when:
        <ul>
            <li>1.4.1	we issue you with written acceptance of an Order with your email invite; or</li>
            <li>1.4.2	we notify you that we are able to provide the Services,	whichever is the earlier, at which point a contract shall come into existence between us.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>1.5	Any quotation for the Services is given on the basis that a binding contract shall only come into existence in accordance with clause 1.4 A quotation from us shall be valid for a period of 30 calendar days from its date of issue, unless we notify you in writing that we have withdrawn it during this period.</li>
        <li>1.6	We shall confirm your order and assign you with an email invitation. Please quote the order number in all subsequent correspondence with us.</li>
        <li>1.7	You may at any time before any agreed delivery date amend or cancel an Order by providing us with written notice to info@getsomeheadspace.com . If you amend or cancel an Order:, your liability to us shall be limited to payment to us of all costs we reasonably incur in fulfilling the Order until we receive your amendment or cancellation. However, where the amendment or cancellation is due to our failure to comply with these Terms you shall have no liability to us for it.</li>
        <li>1.8	If you cancel more than 2 weeks before the commencement date of the Services as set out in your Order then we will attempt to accommodate you on another course or we may offer you a full refund. If you cancel less than 2 weeks before the commencement date then we will accommodate you on another course. If you do not turn up at the course according to your Order at all then you forfeit your right to be accommodated on another course or a refund.</li>
        <li>1.9	We have the right to revise and amend these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in market conditions affecting our business, changes in technology, changes in payment methods, changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements and changes in our system's capabilities. You will be subject to the policies and terms in force at the time that you order the Services from us, unless any change to those policies or these Terms is required by law or government or regulatory authority in which case it will apply to orders you have previously placed that we have not yet fulfilled. If the services are ongoing, we will give you prior notice of any changes to these Terms and you can choose to cancel the Order without penalty before the new Terms affect you.</li>

<p>We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks.
