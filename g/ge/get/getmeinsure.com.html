      <p>This is the privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") for the www.getmeinsure.com site (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy sets forth


        our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of certain information relating to your use of the Site. Your use of this Site signifies your understanding and acceptance of the


        terms of this Privacy Policy.


      


<br><br>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and part of, the Terms and Conditions, which govern your use of the Site in general.


<br>Age Requirement for Use of Site: This Site is not intended for use by persons under the age of 18 years old. You must be 18 years old or older to provide any personal information to the


            Site, or to use the Site.


          


<br> You represent and warrant that you are domiciled in India or an Indian


        Citizen


      


<br><br>1. Information Collecting:


<br>Personal Identifiable Information


        The Site may request and collect certain personally identifiable information including, but not limited to, Application


        Data and other personal information contained in User Submissions, through various means such as online forms, online applications, e-mail and comments submitted to the Site. Such information


        collected through the Site may include financial information, health-related information, and other sensitive information.


        Other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, and unless given permission by you to do so, we will not sell or disclose


          your personally identifiable information to third parties.


<br><br>Non-Personal Identifiable Information


        <br>We may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information via the Site, such as Site usage activity and


          preferences, also known as demographic or profile data.


     <br><br>Why must you give so much personal information?


        Insurance companies establish their rates using a variety of criteria. Since we deal with many companies, we must ask you


        questions required by all of them to determine the most competitive match for you.


     <br><br> NOTICE OF CONSUMER REPORT PRACTICES


      <br>In some cases, insurance companies may need to obtain additional background information about you. As an example Consumer


        reports may be ordered in connection with your insurance application. The Insurance companies might require few more details from you and might get in touch with you through e-mail, phone ,


        fax or a personal appointment. These reports provide information that may assist in determining your eligibility for insurance and the price you may be charged. Consumer reports may also be


        used for updates, renewals or extensions of this insurance.


      <br><br>Technology used with this site


      <br>Like many Web sites, we may use "cookies" and/or other technology (e.g., web bugs, e-mail bugs, clear GIFs, web beacons and tracker

          also use such technologies to remember user preferences or minimize the need for you to re-enter information.
