	<p>
		This GetJar privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") is intended to inform you of GetJar Inc.'s ("we," "us," or "our") policies 
		and practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information through the GetJar Site and 
		GetJar Services. We define Personal Information as information that allows someone to identify or contact you, 
		including for example your name, address, telephone number, and email address.
	</p>
	<p>
		By registering with us or using our website, you expressly consent to the information handling practices in this privacy 
		policy. If you reside outside the United States, you understand that your personal information may be processed in 
		countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing personal information may be less stringent 
		than in your country.
	</p>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy is a part of our <a href="/terms/?ref=0&amp;lvt=1348539983&amp;sid=6q2xrmnz7kt2c276&amp;device=-for-free-download&amp;lang=en" class="link dInline">Terms of Use</a>. If any term of this Privacy Policy is inconsistent or conflicts with any term of 
		the Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy will control. Capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy but not defined in this 
		Privacy Policy have the meanings given to them in the Terms of Use.
	</p>

	<h2>Personal Information You Provide to us</h2>
	<p>
		When you register to use GetJar Services, we may collect your name, e-mail address and e-mail preferences, and password for 
		your account. We may also ask you to provide additional information on an optional basis in connection with setting up your account. 
		You may also register by using your log-in credentials from social networking websites, including Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn.  
		When you register in this way, we may collect Personal Information from the social networking websites that you have given us 
		permission to collect or made publicly available. The information GetJar obtains may depend on your privacy settings with the 
		social networking website. When you purchase any Materials or services from the GetJar Site, we may collect your name, phone number, 
		e-mail address, mailing address, billing address, complete credit card information that enables us to receive your payment (however 
		we do not retain your credit card number unless requested) and federal tax identification number or European Union VAT number as 
		applicable. When you give us feedback, we may collect any information that is contained in your feedback. When you contact us by 
		sending us an e-mail, fax, or letter, we collect your e-mail address, fax number, or mailing address, and any information contained 
		in the e-mail, fax, or letter you send us.

	<h2>Personal Information Collected via Technology</h2>
	<p>
		As you use the GetJar Site or any GetJar Service, some information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol 
		address, browser type, access time, mobile phone model, and telecom carrier. We may also store a small text file called a "Cookie" 
		on your computer or phone to store certain information about your use of the GetJar Site or GetJar Services. We may use both session 
		Cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer or phone until you delete them). 
		We may collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage and application data caches.
	</p>
	<p>
		So that GetJar can provide services, such as version upgrades and app recommendations, we may passively collect information that 
		identifies your mobile device, such as the International Mobile Equipment Identity, IP address, and Android ID. 
		GetJar may also automatically collect data about apps you have installed and the frequency of their use. We may collect details 
		of how you used the GetJar Services, such as your browsing behaviors and search queries.
