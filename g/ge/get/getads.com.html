				  <p><strong>GETADS, LLC, and each of its related  web sites (</strong><strong></strong><strong>GetAds</strong><strong></strong><strong>) Privacy Policy </strong><br>
Last updated September 26, 2007.&nbsp; <br>
This Privacy Policy outlines important  information regarding the use and disclosure of information collected via this  Website.&nbsp; GetAds provides this Privacy Policy to help users make an  informed decision as to whether to use or continue using the Website.&nbsp; <br>
PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM  TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK  FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF  CHANGES. GETADS DOES NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY  POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB SITE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF  THIS PRIVACY POLICY PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO GETADS OR USE ANY  OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES  REFERRED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy applies to GetAds's collection, use, storage and disclosure  of information by GetAds on its (a) websites, including all its divisions,  subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the Website), (b)  on various third party websites, and (c) to GetAds's other information  collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. GetAds  is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third  web sites or applications.&nbsp; <br>
By reference, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the  Website Terms of Use. Your use of the Website and any personal information you  provide via the Website or through other official GetAds contact remains subject  to this Privacy Policy, as well as the Terms of Use and/or other stated  policies. <br>
<br>
<strong>1. Collection of Information. </strong><br>
<strong>1.1 Survey Information. </strong><br>
GetAds collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but  not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an GetAds survey,  order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of  online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third  parties (collectively, a Survey). (As used herein, online means using the  Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and offline means  by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using  telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, GetAds or  a third party (a Third Party) may  ask an individual to provide various information to GetAds, which may include  his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers  (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date,  time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range,  education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment  information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may  be requested from time to time (together, Survey  Information). GetAds may also collect information concerning an  individual from another source and use that information in combination with  information provided from this Web Site. Completing the Surveys is completely  voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey  Information to GetAds or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives  from GetAds or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to  GetAds.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>1.2 Third Party List Information. </strong><br>
GetAds collects information from individuals when an individual provides  information to a Third Party and GetAds subsequently purchases, licenses, or  otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the Seller). Such purchased  information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email  address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone  numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of  the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital  status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and  such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller  (together, Third Party List Information). When acquiring Third Party List Information, GetAds  seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the  Third Party List Information to GetAds and that the Seller has a right to  provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information  is included on the Seller's list.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>1.3 Other Information. </strong><br>
Other occasions when GetAds obtains information from individuals include (1)  when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an  incentive offered by GetAds or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual  requests assistance through GetAds's customer service department, and (3) when  an individual voluntarily subscribes to a GetAds service or newsletter  (together, Other Information).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology. </strong><br>
GetAds currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain  Internet-related information about an individual with information about the  individual in our database. Additionally, GetAds may use other new and evolving  sources of information in the future (together, Technology  Information).&nbsp; <br>
<strong>(a) Cookies.&nbsp; </strong>A cookie is a small amount of data stored  on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows GetAds to identify  the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in GetAds's  database. You may read more about cookies at <a href="http://cookiecentral.com">http://cookiecentral.com </a>. Individuals who use the Website need to accept cookies in order to use  all of the features and functionality of the Website.&nbsp; <br>
<strong>(b) Web Beacons.&nbsp; </strong>A web beacon is programming code that  can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an &lt;img src=x&gt; programming  function -- see <a href="http://truste.org">http://truste.org </a>for more  information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user  identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the  individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a  database. This allows GetAds to track certain web sites an individual visits  online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual  may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing  purposes. For example, GetAds might place, with the consent of a Third Party  website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where baseball products are  sold. When Joe, an individual listed in GetAds's database, visits the baseball  website, GetAds receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the  baseball site, and GetAds would then update Joe's profile with the information  that Joe is interested in baseball. GetAds may thereafter present offers of  baseball related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons  on web pages, GetAds also uses web beacons in email messages sent to  individuals listed in GetAds's database.&nbsp; <br>
<strong>(c) New Technology.&nbsp; </strong>The use of technology on the  Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is  GetAds's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, GetAds strongly  encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use  of technology.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>1.5 Outside Information. </strong><br>
GetAds may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from  other sources of information outside of GetAds including information located in  public databases (Outside Information).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>1.6 Individual Information. </strong><br>
As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party  List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside  Information, and any other information GetAds gathers or receives about  individuals such as usage data, file transfer and viewing data.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>1.7 No Information Collected from Children. </strong><br>
GetAds will never knowingly collect any personal information about children  under the age of 13. If GetAds obtains actual knowledge that it has collected  personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will  be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such  information, GetAds has no such information to use or to disclose to Third  Parties. GetAds has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's  Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>1.8 Credit Card Information. </strong><br>
GetAds may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information,  such as the expiration date of the card (Credit  Card Information) when an individual places an order from GetAds. When  the Credit Card Information is submitted to GetAds, such information is  encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. GetAds will use the  Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase  transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to Third Parties  only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.&nbsp; <br>
Log File Data: When users log-in to access their account, our servers will  automatically record and archive certain information that web-browsers send  whenever visiting a Website. These server logs may include information vital to  validating the user's authorization to access the account. Information, such as  a Web request, Internet Protocol (the IP) address, browser type, browser language, referring  pages, exit pages and visited URLs, platform type, click counts, pages viewed  and in what order, time spent, the date and time of the request, and other  important data is necessary to validate and authorize a user's entry and  activity on the Website.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>2. Use of Individual Information. </strong><br>
<strong>2.1 Discretion to Use Information. </strong><br>
THE COMPANY MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE  IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION.&nbsp; <br>
The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how GetAds currently uses  Individual Information, but GetAds may change or broaden its use at any time.  As noted, GetAds may update this policy from time to time. GetAds may use  Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of  email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner  advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>2.2 Email. </strong><br>
GetAds uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers by email to  individuals. GetAds may maintain separate email lists for different purposes.  If email recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular  list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to  unsubscribe from the particular list. To unsubscribe from all GetAds's email  lists, a person must send an email to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@getads.com">unsubscribe@getads.com </a>. <br>
<strong>2.2(a) Content of Email Messages. </strong><br>
In certain commercial email messages sent by GetAds, an advertiser's name will  appear in the From: line but hitting  the Reply button will cause a  reply email to be sent to GetAds. The Subject: line of GetAds email messages will usually contain a  line provided from the advertiser to GetAds.&nbsp; <br>
<strong>2.2(b) Solicited Email. </strong><br>
GetAds only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the Website to  receive email from GetAds or to individuals who have agreed on Third Party  websites to receive email from Third Parties such as GetAds. GetAds does not  send unsolicited email messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain  formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to GetAds's email  messages.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>2.3 Targeted Advertising. </strong><br>
GetAds uses Individual Information to target advertising to an individual. When  an individual is using the Internet, GetAds uses Technology Information (see  also Section 2.5 below) to associate an individual with that person's Individual  Information, and GetAds attempts to show advertising for products and services  in which the person has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an  interest by means of Technology Information, and otherwise. GetAds may, at its  discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell  phones, and other means of communication to provide promotional offers.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>2.4 Direct Mail and Telemarketing. </strong><br>
GetAds uses Individual Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to  individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and  cell phones.&nbsp; <br>
<strong>2.5&nbsp; Mobile Phone SMS Messaging. </strong> <br>
In certain cases, when requested by an  individual, a Third Party may use Individual Information to provide customized  content and advertising via SMS messaging to an individual's cell phone.&nbsp;  GetAds is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such  Third Parties.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>2.6 Use of Technology Information. </strong><br>
GetAds uses Technology Information (1) to match a person's Survey Information  and Third Party List Information to other categories of Individual Information  to make and improve profiles of individuals, (2) to track a person's online  browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to determine which areas of GetAds's web  sites are most frequently visited. This information helps GetAds to better  understand the online habits of individuals so that GetAds can target  advertising and promotions to them.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>2.7 Profiles of Individuals. </strong><br>
GetAds uses Individual Information to make a profile of an individual. A  profile can be created by combining Survey Information and Third Party List  Information with other sources of Individual Information such as information  obtained from public databases.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>2.8 Storage of Individual Information </strong>.&nbsp; <br>
GetAds stores the Individual Information in a database on GetAds computers. Our  computers have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect  against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under GetAds's  control. Not withstanding such measures, GetAds cannot guarantee that its  security measures will prevent GetAds computers from being illegally accessed,  and the Individual Information on them stolen or altered.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>3. Dissemination of Individual Information. </strong><br>
<strong>3.1 Sale or Transfer to Third Parties. </strong><br>

Individuals have access to their Individual Information collected to provide an  opportunity for an individual to correct, amend, or delete such information.  Access can be obtained by contacting <a href="mailto:info@getads.com">info@getads.com </a>.
