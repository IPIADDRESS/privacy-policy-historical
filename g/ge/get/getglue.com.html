GetGlue respects your privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of your personal information, such as your name, email address and mailing address. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how your personal information is collected and used by us. Contact us with any questions you may have by emailing <a href="mailto:support@getglue.com">support@getglue.com</a>. We’re always happy to hear from you.</p><h2>How GetGlue Works</h2><p>The GetGlue website and mobile apps enable you to “check in” to your entertainment and get entertainment recommendations based on your likes, what your friends like and what’s popular now. GetGlue works by recognizing books, music, movies, wine, restaurants, and other entertainment on GetGlue.com and on popular pages around the web. You rate your favorites to create a personal taste profile. The GetGlue software saves the items that you check-in to and the things you like, and recommends to you other things that you may be interested in. You can share your opinion and leave a comment, posting information to be displayed publicly under your user name. You can get free stickers and, from time to time, additional offers and rewards. Additionally, you can choose to add the GetGlue app to your web browser and it will appear automatically on certain popular sites around the web.</p><p>By using GetGlue you build a library of your entertainment taste preferences. That library is part of GetGlue’s service. To provide you this service, GetGlue needs to keep track of what you checkin to and what items you like. By its nature, the GetGlue service needs to make use of information about you. Any use we make of your information is subject to the terms of this privacy policy. If you use GetGlue, you agree to allow us to use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p><p>You are in control of what information about yourself and your network activities you share with us and with other GetGlue users. Visit <a href="http://getglue.com/settings">http://getglue.com/settings</a> to configure your account settings to reflect your privacy preferences.</p><h2>What information does GetGlue collect and how?</h2><p>Personal information collected by GetGlue is information voluntarily provided to us by you when you create your account or change your account information.  Currently, information that we save about you includes your display name, your email address, and your user id. In addition, if you request free stickers or other rewards to be physically mailed to you, GetGlue will ask you for your mailing address.  This mailing address is only used to mail you the stickers or other rewards and is not used for any other purpose. Once the particular stickers or other rewards are sent to you, we no longer save your mailing address.</p><p>GetGlue stores your entertainment check ins, likes, dislikes and comments that you provide us with. In addition, if you add GetGlue to your browser, it will by default store the books, movies, music, shows, games and topics you visit around the web on popular sites.  By visiting <a href="http://getglue.com/settings">http://getglue.com/settings</a>, you can set your account to hide your visits so that things you have checked out won’t be shown on your profile. When you unsubscribe from the GetGlue service, all data that we have saved about you is deleted.</p><p>The GetGlue website and widgets (<a href="http://getglue.com/widgets">http://getglue.com/widgets</a>) use cookies.
