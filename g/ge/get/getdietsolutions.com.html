We also collect and store any personal information and other data you have provided to us via the Website, by email, or otherwise.</p>
<p>We use this information to respond to any inquiries you may submit to us, to track and monitor usage of the Website and to communicate with you about your account and your use of the Website. In addition, we may use this information to send you periodic publications associated with Company and/or Company’s products, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications via email. We also use this information to operate the Website; in particular, to facilitate postings on our discussion forums. We may also use this information for targeted advertising and other marketing purposes. We may also use this information to measure the Website’s effectiveness, tailor our products and services, better advertise to suit the personal interests of you and others, estimate our audience size, and any other use that Company believes may enhance your experience using the Website.</p>
<p><i>Website Information</i><br>
The Website collects and stores information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the Website. This aggregate information is collected site-wide, and includes anonymous website statistics. The Website also employs browser cookies to store users’ preferences and record session information. “Cookies” are bits of information that are stored by your browser on your hard drive. This technology allows for the storage of user preferences, user ID and password, if applicable, and remembers you when you take action on the Website. You can turn off the “cookie” function through most standard browsers; however, the majority of the features on the Website may not function properly, including but not limited to, the login and order functions, if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
<p>In addition, when you visit the Website our system automatically collects information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, numbers assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), browser type, browser language, domain names, referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, clear gifs, internet tags, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of these page views, the amount of time spent on particular pages, network traffic monitoring, active scripting, the date and time of your request and the unique identity of your browser. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the Website, improve the design of the Website, track user movement, and otherwise enhance the services we provide.</p>
<p><i>Other Information</i><br>

<p><b>Disclosure and Use of Information</b><br>
We will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any of the information about you in our possession, and we may use such information to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend against legal claims. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information, including data on which pages you have visited, to third parties if we feel it is necessary to protect our systems, Website, business, users or others.</p>
<p>In addition, information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. We do not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this policy nor shall Company be liable for any security breaches that may occur after the transfer of information.</p>
<p>We use your personal information to process orders, maintain your membership, store information, and provide marketing or promotional materials. We may also disclose your personal information to authorized contractors used by Company to support our business and provision of services to you (such as, but not limited to, fulfillment services, customer service, technical support, delivery services, and financial institutions). We will request that such third parties agree to treat your personal information in keeping with the guidelines set forth within this Policy. We may, at our discretion, disclose personal information, when deemed necessary or appropriate, to law enforcement or authorized government organizations, to protect our rights or the rights of others, to prevent identity theft and harm to persons or property, to fight fraud, to ensure the integrity of our business, or to otherwise protect the right, property, or safety of Company and our employees or others.</p>
