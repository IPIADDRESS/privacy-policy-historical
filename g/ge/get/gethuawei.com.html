Huawei may, at its own discretion, collect, use, transfer or disclose non-personal information for any purpose.
<br><br><strong>2. Cookies policy
</strong><br><br>To make our websites function properly, we sometimes place small data files on your computer or mobile devices, known as cookies. A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a websites server and only that server will be able to retrieve or read the contents of that cookie. Each cookie is unique to your web browser. It will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier and the site name and some digits and numbers. It allows a website to remember things like your preferences or whats in your shopping basket.

<br><br>Most big websites or internet service providers do this in order to improve your user experience by enabling that website to remember you, either for the duration of your visit (using a session cookie) or for repeat visits (using a persistent cookie). Cookies help the site remember your settings  language, font size and other preferences for how you want to view the site on your computer or mobile devices - so you dont have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to us. If a website doesnt use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site  for example, when you enter your login details and move to another page it wont recognize you and it wont be able to keep you logged in.

<br><br>Our cookies are not used to identify you personally. Theyre just there to make the site work better for you. You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish  for details, see AboutCookies.org. You can delete all the cookies already on your computer and you can set most browsers to block them being placed. But if you do this, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit our websites.

<br><br>Instructions on how to change your browser settings are available at the following links: <br><br>Internet Explorer - http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260971 <br>Google Chrome - https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en-GB&amp;p=cpn_cookies <br>Mozilla Firefox - https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer?redirectlocale=en-US&amp;redirectslug=Cookies <br>Safari - http://support.apple.com/kb/PH5042 <br>Opera - http://www.opera.com/help/tutorials
<br><br>&nbsp;Huawei does not use cookies for any other purpose than those presented here and does not use them to collect any personal data for any other purpose.
<br><br><strong>3. How Huawei discloses your personal data</strong>

<br><br>Huawei will not sell or disclose your personal information to 3rd parties except in the following circumstances:

<br><br>(i) Your explicit permission to disclose your information is given to Huawei. In this instance, and after obtaining your approval, Huawei may share your personal information with other companies.

<br>(ii) To other Huawei subsidiaries or authorized suppliers and service providers. Huawei may need to provide you certain services through authorized suppliers and service providers (Authorized 3rd Parties), thus Huawei will share some of your personal information with Authorized 3rd Parties to enrich our services and fulfill your requirements, such as, when you decide to purchase Huawei products online, Huawei will submit your personal information to relevant logistic service providers so as to allow them to deliver the products to you or allow our Authorized 3rd Parties to provide you with other customer services. Huawei strictly forbids Huawei subsidiaries or Authorized 3rd Parties to use shared personal information for any other purpose.

<br>(iii) When required by law or by governmental authorities. Huawei may disclose your personal information when required by law, legal proceedings, litigation or public, governmental authorities.

<br>(iv) Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Huawei decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize its business. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure or your personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is Huaweis practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.
<br><br><strong>4. How to update, change or check your personal data</strong>

<br><br>You are responsible for the accuracy of the personal information that you submit. Huawei will use commercial best efforts to keep your personal information accurate. Should you wish to delete or amend such information, you can do so by modifying your information within your account or you can also call our customer service to assist you at 1-888-548-2934.

<br><br><strong>5. How Huawei protects your personal data</strong>

<br><br>To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of your information, Huawei utilizes reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect and process. For instance, technically, Huawei uses anti-virus software, data encryption, and monitoring of our system to protect the data center from cyber attacks. To protect your information physically, Huawei restricts access to your information to only those people who need such information for a business purpose. To protect your information structurally, Huawei makes sure its employees understand the importance of protecting personal data by providing awareness training about security and privacy protection. Although we take reasonable measures to protect your personal data, please note that no security measures could be 100% perfect or unbreakable.

<br><br><strong>6. How Huawei treats personal data from children

</strong><br><br>Huawei does not knowingly collect personal information from children without requiring that the child seek prior parental consent, as required by applicable law. Huawei encourages parents and guardians to take an active role in their childrens online and mobile activities and interests. The definition of child or children should take into account applicable laws as well as national and regional cultural customs.
<br><br><strong>7. Third party service providers

</strong><br><br>For your convenience and to enrich your experience, GetHauwei.com may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. You can choose to use such links, use the services or purchase products from these third parties; however Huawei does not control the privacy and data protection measures of these third parties. Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by the third partys privacy policy. Huawei encourages you to learn about the privacy practices of these third parties.
<br><br><strong>8. Data transfer

</strong><br><br>Huawei products and services may be provided using resources and servers located in various countries around the world. Therefore your personal information may be transferred across international borders outside the country where you use our services, those countries may not have laws providing specific protection for personal data or that have different legal rules regarding data protection. In such cases, Huawei takes steps to ensure that there is a legal basis for such a transfer and that adequate protection for your personal data is provided as required by applicable law, for example, by using standard agreements approved by relevant authorities (where necessary) and by requiring the use of other appropriate technical and organizational information security measures.
<br><br><strong>9. Update of this policy

</strong><br><br>Huawei may from time to time amend or update this privacy policy. If Huawei modifies its policy, we will post the updated version here. If Huawei makes significant changes that materially alter the policy, we may also notify you by other means, such as sending an email or posting a notice on GetHauwei.com and/or social media pages prior to the changes taking effect.
<br><br><strong>10. Contact Huawei
