We refer to all of these products, together with our other services and websites as "Services" in this policy.</p><p>This policy also explains your choices about how we use information about you. Your choices include how you can object to certain uses of information about you and how you can access and update certain information about you. <strong>If you do not agree with this policy, do not access or use our Services or interact with any other aspect of our business.</strong></p><p>Where we provide the Services under contract with an organization (for example your employer) that organization controls the information processed by the Services.</p><h2 id="information-we-collect">What information we collect about you</h2><p>We collect information about you when you provide it to us, when you use our Services, and when other sources provide it to us, as further described below.</p><h3 id="information-you-provide">Information you provide to us</h3><p>We collect information about you when you input it into the Services or otherwise provide it directly to us.</p><p><strong><em>Account and Profile Information:</em></strong> We collect information about you when you register for an account, create or modify your profile, set preferences, sign-up for or make purchases through the Services. For example, you provide your contact information and, in some cases, billing information when you register for the Services. You also have the option of adding a display name, profile photo, and other details to your profile information to be displayed in our Services. We keep track of your preferences when you select settings within the Services.</p><p><strong><em>Content you provide through our products:</em></strong> The Services include the Postman products you use, where we collect and store content that you post, send, receive and share. This content includes any information about you that you may choose to include: we collect feedback you provide directly to us through the product and we collect clickstream data about how you interact with and use features in the Services.</p><p><strong><em>Content you provide through our websites:</em></strong> The Services also include our websites owned or operated by us. We collect other content that you submit to these websites, which include social media or social networking websites operated by us. For example, you provide content to us when you provide feedback or when you participate in any interactive features, surveys, contests, promotions, activities or events.</p><p><strong><em>Information you provide through our support channels:</em></strong> The Services also include our customer support, where you may choose to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing with a Service. Whether you designate yourself as an admin or billing contact, open a support ticket, speak to one of our representatives directly or otherwise engage with our support team, you will be asked to provide contact information, a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue.</p><p><strong><em>Payment Information:</em></strong> We collect certain payment and billing information when you register for certain paid Services. For example, we ask you to designate a billing representative, including name and contact information, upon registration. You might also provide payment information, such as payment card details, which we collect via secure payment processing services.</p><h3 id="information-when-you-use-services">Information we collect automatically when you use the Services</h3><p>We collect information about you when you use our Services, including browsing our websites and taking certain actions within the Services.</p><p><strong><em>Your use of the Services:</em></strong> We keep track of certain information about you when you visit and interact with any of our Services. This information includes the features you use; the links you click on and how you interact with others on the Services. We also collect information about the teams and people you work with and how you work with them, like who you collaborate with and communicate with most frequently.</p><p><strong><em>Device and Connection Information:</em></strong> We collect information about the computer you use to access the Services. This device information includes your connection type and settings when you install, access, update, or use our Services. We also collect information through your device about your operating system, browser type, IP address, URLs of referring/exit pages, device identifiers, and crash data. We use your IP address and/or country preference in order to approximate your location to provide you with a better Service experience. How much of this information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services.</p><p><strong><em>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:</em></strong> Postman and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g., web beacons, device identifiers and pixels) to provide functionality and to recognize you across different Services and devices.</p><h3 id="information-from-other-sources">Information we receive from other sources</h3><p>We receive information about you from other Service users, from third-party services.</p><p><strong><em>Other users of the Services:</em></strong> Other users of our Services may provide information about you when they submit content through the Services. For example, you may be mentioned in a support ticket opened by someone else. We also receive your email address from other Service users when they provide it in order to invite you to the Services. Similarly, an administrator may provide your contact information when they designate you as the billing or admin on your company's account.</p><p><strong><em>Other services you link to your account:</em></strong> We receive information about you when you or your administrator integrate or link a third-party service with our Services. For example, if you create an account or log into the Services using your Google credentials, we receive your name and email address as permitted by your Google profile settings in order to authenticate you. You or your administrator may also integrate our Services with other services you use. The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.</p><p><strong><em>Postman Partners:</em></strong> We work with a variety of Resellers who provide purchasing and other services around our products. We receive information from these resellers, such as billing information, billing and admin contact information, company name, what Postman products you have purchased or may be interested in.</p><h2 id="how-we-use-information">How we use information we collect</h2><p>Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you.</p><p><strong><em>To provide the Services and personalize your experience:</em></strong> We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate and maintain the Services. For example, we use the name and picture you provide in your account to identify you to other Service users. Our Services also include tailored features that personalize your experience, enhance your productivity, and improve your ability to collaborate effectively with others by automatically analyzing the activities of your team to provide activity feeds and notifications that are relevant for you and your team. We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites. Where you use multiple Services, we combine information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to find information from one Service while searching from another or to present relevant product information as you travel across our websites.</p><p><strong><em>For research and development:</em></strong> We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated, and useful to you. We use collective learnings about how people use our Services and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Services. We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.</p><p><strong><em>To communicate with you about the Services:</em></strong> We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages. We also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service. These communications are part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out of them. If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.</p><p><strong><em>To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services:</em></strong> We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Postman ads on other companies' websites and applications, as well as on platforms like Facebook and Google. These communications are aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you. We also communicate with you about new product offers, promotions and contests. You can control whether you receive these communications as described below under "Opt-out of communications."</p><p><strong><em>For Customer support:</em></strong> We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services.</p><p><strong><em>For safety and security:</em></strong> We use information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of Service policies.</p><p><strong><em>To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights:</em></strong> Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.</p><p><strong><em>With your consent:</em></strong> We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.</p><h4 id="legal-bases-for-processing">Legal bases for processing (for EEA users):</h4><p>If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:</p><ul><li>We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;</li><li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;</li><li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or</li><li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li></ul><p>If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.</p><h2 id="how-we-share-information-we-collect">How we share information we collect</h2><p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p><h3 id="sharing-with-other-services">Sharing with other Service users</h3><p>When you use the Services, we share certain information about you with other Service users.</p><p><strong><em>For collaboration:</em></strong> You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission to others to see, share, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your administrator (if applicable) select.</p><p><strong><em>Managed accounts and administrators:</em></strong> If you register or access the Services using an email address with a domain that is owned by your employer or organization, and such organization wishes to establish an account or site, certain information about you including your name, profile picture, contact info, content and past use of your account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator and other Service users sharing the same domain. If you are an administrator for a particular site or group of users within the Services, we may share your contact information with current or past Service users, for the purpose of facilitating Service-related requests.</p><p><strong><em>Community Forums:</em></strong> Our websites offer publicly accessible blogs, forums, issue trackers, and wikis like Postman Community. You should be aware that any information you provide on these websites - including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information - may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you delete your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services. To request removal of your information from publicly accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as provided below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to and why.</p><h3 id="sharing-with-third-parties">Sharing with third parties</h3><p>We share information with third parties that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support and market our Services.</p><p><strong><em>Service Providers:</em></strong> We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you. If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including policies and procedures designed to protect your information.</p><p><strong><em>Third Party Apps:</em></strong> You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to add new functionality or change the behavior of the Services by enabling integrations with third party apps within the Services. Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you like your name and email address, and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps.</p><p>Third-party app policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices. If you object to information about you being shared with these third parties, please uninstall the app.</p><p><strong><em>Links to Third Party Sites:</em></strong> The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit information to any of those third party sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies, not this one. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p><p><strong><em>Third-Party Widgets:</em></strong> Some of our Services contain widgets and social media features, such as the Twitter "tweet" button. These widgets and features collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Widgets and social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p><p><strong><em>Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Rights:</em></strong> In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect Postman, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.</p><h2 id="how-we-store-information">How we store and secure information we collect</h2><h3 id="information-storage-and-security">Information storage and security</h3><p>We use data hosting service providers in the United States and host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data.</p><p>While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.</p><h3 id="how-long-we-keep-information">How long we keep information</h3><p>How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information.</p><p><strong><em>Account information:</em></strong> We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and up to six months thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services.</p><p><strong><em>Information you share on the Services:</em></strong> If your account is deleted, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services.</p><p><strong><em>Managed accounts:</em></strong> If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account.</p><p><strong><em>Marketing information:</em></strong> If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Postman account. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.</p><h2 id="how-to-access-your-information">How to access and control your information</h2><p>You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.</p><h3 id="your-choices">Your Choices:</h3><p>You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format. Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests. You may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance.</p><p>Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. Where you have asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted. If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.</p><p><strong><em>Access and update your information:</em></strong> Our Services and related documentation give you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the Service. You can update your profile information within your profile settings.</p><p><strong><em>Delete your account:</em></strong> If you no longer wish to use our Services, you or your administrator may be able to delete your Services account. If you can delete your own account, that setting is available to you in your account settings. Otherwise, please contact your administrator. You may also contact Postman support (<a href="mailto:help@getpostman.com" title="Contact Postman Support" rel="noopener">help@getpostman.com</a>) to request your account be deleted.</p><p><strong><em>Delete your information:</em></strong> Our Services give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can remove certain profile information within your profile settings. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.</p><p><strong><em>Request that we stop using your information:</em></strong> In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy. Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below. When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request. If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable). If you object to information about you being shared with a third-party integration, please disable the integration or contact your administrator to do so.</p><p><strong><em>Opt out of communications:</em></strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database. Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services.</p><p><strong><em>Data portability:</em></strong> Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to another carrier). Depending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information. Should you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file of your basic account information and the information you create on the spaces you under your sole control, like your personal Postman account.</p><h2 id="how-we-transfer-information">How we transfer information we collect internationally</h2><h3 id="international-transfers-of-information">International transfers of information we collect</h3><p>We collect information globally and primarily store that information in the United States.

Where the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g. your employer), that organization is the administrator of the Services and is responsible for the accounts and/or Service sites over which it has control. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organization's policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator's organization, which may be different than this policy.</p><p>Administrators are able to:</p><ul><li>terminate your access to the Services;</li><li>install or uninstall third-party integrations</li></ul><p>Even if the Services are not currently administered to you by an organization, if you use an email address provided by an organization (such as your work email address) to access the Services, then the owner of the domain associated with your email address (e.g. your employer) may assert administrative control over your account and use of the Services at a later date. You will be notified if this happens.</p><p>If you do not want an administrator to be able to assert control over your account or use of the Services, use your personal email address to register for or access the Services. If an administrator has not already asserted control over your account or access to the Services, you can update the email address associated with your account through your account settings in your profile. Once an administrator asserts control over your account or use of the Services, you will no longer be able to change the email address associated with your account without administrator approval.</p><p>Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator’s organizational policies for more information.</p><h3 id="california-online-privacy">California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h3><p>Because we value your privacy we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act.
