		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				<br>
		
		Privacy matters, and GetUp is totally committed to ensuring that your participation in our important work protects that privacy. <br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>What information we collect and why</h4><br>
GetUp collects personal information to allow us to send you opportunities to get up and participate in campaigns. In order to improve these campaigns and our responsiveness to members, we collect the following information:<blockquote><b>Information you provide –</b> GetUp collects your name and email address for the purpose of sending you opportunities to get up and participate in our campaigns. You can ask to stop receiving these emails or change your details at any time by using the link at the bottom of each email or by sending an email to: privacy@getup.org.au.  Any additional information you choose to provide in the course of GetUp actions and surveys is stored securely. <br>
<b>Communications with us – </b>When you send an email to GetUp or give us information over the phone, we may retain this in order to respond to your inquiry. <br>
<b>User trends - </b>We also collect information about how GetUp members respond to our emails and how many take action through our site. We analyse these trends to improve our campaigns and communications.</blockquote><h4>Information Security</h4><br>
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorised access to or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorised access to systems where we store personal data.<br>
<br>
<b>We won't sell, trade or exchange your information without your permission</b>.<br>
<br>
GetUp will not provide your personal information to any other organisation, with some exceptions:<ul><li>where required for financial transactions (eg. to verify credit cards);<br>
</li><li>when you petition a decision-maker through our website, your name, town and state will be forwarded to the decision-maker, but not your email or physical address;<br>
</li><li>when you send an email through this site, for example to a member of Parliament, that email will come from your address, not GetUp's, and hence will include the details you provide, often including your email address; or,<br>
</li><li>as required by law, including disclosure to the Australian Electoral Commission. </li></ul><br>
Access to personal information is restricted to GetUp employees who need to know that information in order to run and improve our campaigns. Volunteers are really important to GetUp, and one of the ways we keep costs down and make your donations go further. In some circumstances trusted volunteers who sign non-disclosure forms are given access to limited information for the purposes of contacting GetUp members or improving our campaigns. All individuals with access to data are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.<br>
<br>
<h4>Changes to this policy</h4><br>
Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your consent. Most changes will be minor, but nonetheless we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. You can see an archive of our previous privacy policy <a href="http://www.getup.org.au/pages/privacyarchive">here</a>.<br>
<br>

If you would like more information on privacy at GetUp, <a href="http://www.getup.org.au/about/contact/">contact us by email</a>, or on 02 9264 4037.
