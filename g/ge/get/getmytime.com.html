      <p>As an Internet user, you no doubt recognize the usefulness 
        of this amazing medium. A medium of such great promise in one-to-one and 
        one-to-many communications does not come without its concerns. Many members 
        of the on-line community are rightfully concerned about maintaining a 
        comfortable level of privacy. As active members of the on-line community, 
        <b>GetMyTime.com</b> and <b>netlogix</b> supports industry self-regulation. 
        We believe all web sites should openly share their policies and practices 
        of collecting and processing information. </p>
      <p><b class="boldgreen">Forms</b> </p>
      <p>We use web-based forms to collect vital information from parties interested 
        in communicating with <b>netlogix</b>. We ask that users share as much 
        information as deemed appropriate. This information is used for the sole 
        purpose of serving our clients better. We will not sell, share or rent 
        this information to any outside parties unless you have so requested. 
        Your company information is encrypted while being uploaded to <b>GetMyTime.com</b> 
        using a Thawte SSL Encryption License. </p>
      <p><b class="boldgreen">Billing Information</b> </p>
      <p>We request billing information from the user on our order page. Here 
        a user must provide contact information (i.e. name and shipping address) 
        and financial information (i.e. credit card number, expiration date). 
        This information is used for billing purposes. If we have trouble processing 
        an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 
        All billing information is encrypted during transit to and from our servers 
        (using a Thawte SSL Encryption License), and while being stored. </p>
      <p><b class="boldgreen">Cookies</b> </p>
      <p>In many cases cookies are greatly misunderstood. When used as intended, 
        a cookie is simply a reminder that some web sites place on your hard drive. 
        This allows the web site in question to recognize your computer on return 
        visits. For example, in order to view the New York Times web site, you 
        must first register with their service. After registration, a cookie is 
        placed on the user's machine so the web site will recognize their web 
        browser the next time they return and will not prompt them to register 
        again. Most standard browsers have the option of refusing all cookies 
        - so no web site can force a cookie upon you if you do not want it. <b>GetMyTime.com</b> 
        uses cookies to track your "session" or visit to our web site. This allows 
        us to enhance your visit to the web site, and evaluate overall usage of 
        <b>GetMyTime.com</b> site. </p>
      <p><b class="boldgreen">Server Activity </b></p>
      <p>Server software employed by all Internet Service Providers, is capable 
        of detecting: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> The browser name and version you are using (i.e. Netscape 3.1) </li>
        <li> The types of plug-ins you are using (i.e. Flash, Shockwave, Real 
          Audio) </li>
        <li> Your operating system (i.e. Windows 2000, MacOS, Windows NT). </li>
        <li> IP number. - IP Addresses are not linked to personally identifiable 
          information. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This information is helpful in delivering the appropriate content to 
        you, the end user. For example, if our software detects that you are using 
        the Flash plug-in, you might view a much higher quality and faster-loading 
        animation than a user without the plug-in. This information is not stored 
        or tracked and is only used to provide you with better information. The 
        following information can NOT be gathered from you unless you willingly 
        submit it: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Your e-mail address. </li>
        <li> Your credit card number. </li>
        <li> Your street address or phone number. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b class="boldgreen">Links</b> </p>
      <p>This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that 
        <b>GetMyTime.com</b> and <b>netlogix, inc.</b> is not responsible for 
        the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be 
        aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each 
        and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. 
        This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this 
        Web site. </p>
      <p><b class="boldgreen">Security </b></p>
      <p>This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. 
        When users submit sensitive information via the web site, your information 
        is protected both online and off-line. </p>
      <p>When any of our web forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such 
        as credit card number and/or social security number), that information 
        is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the 
        industry - SSL. </p>
      <p>While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the 
        bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet 
        Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are 
        just 'surfing'. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information 
        online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information 
        off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information 
        mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need 
        the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk 
        or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally 
        identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date 
        on our security and privacy practices. As policies are added, our employees 
        are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, 
        and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. 
        Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information 
        on are kept in a secure environment. </p>
      <p>If you have any questions about the security at our web site, you can 
        send an email to <a href="mailto:info@netlogix.net">info@netlogix.net</a>. 
      </p>
      <p><b class="boldgreen">Correction/Updating Personal Information </b></p>
      <p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your 
        e-mail address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor 
        to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data 
        provided to us. This can usually be done by contacting <a href="mailto:customerservice@getmytime.com">Customer 
        Support</a>. </p>
