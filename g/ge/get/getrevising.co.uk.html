However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p><p><strong>What we may need from you</strong></p><p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p><p><strong>Time limit to respond</strong></p><p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p><p><strong>10. Glossary</strong></p><p><strong>LAWFUL BASIS</strong></p><p>Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience.

We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</p><p>Performance of Contract means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p><p>Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.</p><p><strong>THIRD PARTIES</strong></p><p><strong>Internal Third Parties</strong></p><p>Other companies in The Student Room&nbsp;Group [acting as joint controllers or processors] and who are based [SPECIFIC COUNTRIES] and provide IT and system administration services and undertake leadership reporting.</p><p><strong>External Third Parties Acting as Data Processors</strong></p><p>- Email service providers - Salesforce, Marketing Cloud, dotMailer – they send the emails from us to you – both marketing emails and those helping you manage your account and notifications.</p><p>- SMS service provider – Text Marketing – if you’ve opted in for SMS messages, this is the service we use to send them.</p><p>- Survey and quiz tools – SurveyMonkey, GetFeedBack – we use these to enable you to partake in surveys and quizzes and help us gather feedback.</p><p>- Data analysis service providers – Google Analytics, Salesforce DMP – we use these to collect data on site visitors and pageviews to understand our audience and improve our websites and the services we offer you.</p><p>- Website maintenance tools – we use to administer and protect our websites.</p><p>- Hosting service providers – GossamerThreads, Rackspace, Amazon Web services – they host our websites and data.</p><p>&nbsp;- Ad serving providers – DoubleClick for Publishers, DoubleClick Bid Manager, Facebook – we use these services to deliver relevant advertising to you on our sites and elsewhere and understand the effectiveness of the adverts.</p><p>- Personalisation tool – Dynamic Yield – we use this service to personalise your experience on our sites and in emails to ensure it is as relevant as possible for you.</p><p>- Geo-identification service – MaxMind – we use this to find out your approximate location, based on your IP address, so we can deliver more relevant ads, content and emails to you.</p><p>- Professional advisers - including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, legal, insurance and accounting services.

Based in the United Kingdom.</p><p><strong>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong></p><p>You have the right to:</p><p>- Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p><p>- Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p><p>- Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p><p>- Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p><p>- Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p><p>- Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p><p>- Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p><p><br></p></section><footer class="empty"></footer></article>
