			<p>GetYourGuide has provided this privacy policy because we value your right to privacy. This policy describes the ways we collect, store, use and protect your personal information. GetYourGuide's Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") is designed to help you make informed decisions when using GetYourGuide, located at www.getyourguide�s and its directly associated domains (collectively, "GetYourGuide").</p><br>
			
			<p>By using or accessing GetYourGuide, you are accepting and agree to comply with the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Please read this policy carefully before providing us with any personal information. If you have questions about this policy, contact us (LINK).</p><br>
			
			<p>This policy is effective as of April 1st, 2008. We may amend this policy at any time by posting a revised version on our website. The revised version will be effective at the time we post it. In addition, if the revised version includes a substantial change, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the changes and to give you the opportunity to amend or cancel your registration.</p><br><br>
			
			<p class="green">How we collect information about you</p><br>
			
			<p><strong>1. Unregistered Users</strong></p><br>
			
			<p>When you visit the GetYourGuide website, we collect your IP address and standard web log information, such as your browser type and the pages you accessed on our website. We may also store information from your interaction with us including computer and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the sites, ad data, and standard web log information.</p><br>
			
			<p>We also place a small file known as a "cookie" on your computer's hard drive. A cookie may contain information that allows us to track your path through our Web site and to determine whether you have visited us before. However, unless you register with us, it contains no personally identifiable information that would allow us to identify you. Cookies cannot be used to read data off of your hard drive, and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by other Web sites. We use cookies in this manner to help us understand how visitors use our site, and to help us to improve our site. You may refuse to accept a cookie from us by following the procedures specific to your Web browser. Although you may do so, you may find that your browser reacts strangely when visiting not only our Web site, but other Web sites as well. Since cookies don't provide us with any information from which we can identify you, we suggest you allow us to place one on your computer.</p><br>
			
			<p>If you visit our site by "clicking-through" from a site operated by one of our partners, and you have registered with that partner, then certain information about you that you have provided to that partner may be transmitted to us. You should review the privacy policy of the Web site from which you reached our site in order to determine what information was collected and how you agreed that our partner could use that information. Regardless of what information was transmitted to us, however, we don't keep it unless you register with us.</p><br>
			
			<p>We also collect e-mail addresses from unregistered users who send us support and feedback mail or request technical or other help. This information enables GetYourGuide to improve its sites to make your online visits more productive and enjoyable.</p><br><br>
			
			<p><strong>2. Registered Users</strong></p><br>
			
			<p>If you register on the website and create an user account, in addition to the non-personal information described above, we collect the following types of information from you:</p><br>
			
			<ul>
			<li>User information: your name, address, phone, email, password, physical contact information and other similar information.</li>
			<li>Transactional information based on your activities on the sites (such as buying, selling, tours and content you generate or that relates to your account). When you are using our Service, we collect information about your account transactions and we may collect information about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention purposes.</li>
			<li>Community discussions, blogs, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through our sites, and correspondence sent to us</li>
			<li>Financial information: the bank account numbers, credit card numbers, paypal account and other financial information that you link to your GetYourGuide account.</li>
			</ul><br>
			
			<p>We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as credit bureaus as permitted by law, e.g. If you incur a debt to GetYourGuide, and identity verification services. If the information you provide cannot be verified, we may ask you to send us additional information, such as your driver license, credit card statement, or a recent utility bill or other information confirming your address, or to answer additional questions online to help verify your information.</p><br>
			
			<p>To improve services and enhance personalization, we may periodically obtain information about you from other independent third-party sources and add it to your registration information. Additionally, authorized GetYourGuide personnel may update your registration information to accurately reflect any new information included in communications received from you.</p><br>
			
			<p>Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here. For example, we may collect information related to your contact with our customer support team or store results when you respond to a survey.</p><br><br>
			
			
			<p class="green">How we use the personal information we collect</p><br>
			
			<p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience.</p><br>
			
			<p>We may use your personal information to:</p><br>
			
			<ul>
			<li>provide the services and customer support you request;</li>
			<li>send notifications to you about the status of your profile, tours, transactions, new membership benefits and features, to let you know of urgent problems on our site, to present special members-only opportunities to buy products and services that are appropriate to the interests of our community, and other important information;</li>
			<li>resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;</li>
			<li>prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our Terms and Conditions;</li>
			<li>customize, measure, and improve our services and the content and layout of our website;</li>
			<li>send you important service update notices and request for your feedback;</li>
			<li>send you additional materials which might include opt-in newsletters and other materials that you proactively request from GetYourGuide;</li>
			<li>compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.</li>
			</ul><br>
			
			<p>You may opt-out of any or all marketing communications from GetYourGuide in any commercial e-mail we send or at any time, as well as access and update your personal information, by changing your preferences in the Settings page of the "My Profile" tab.</p>
			<br><br>
			
			<p class="green">How we share personal information with other GetYourGuide users</p><br>
			
			<p>To process your tour bookings, we need to share some of your personal information with the entity that you are booking a tour from or is booking a tour from you. Your contact information will be displayed to entities whom you have a confirmed booking transaction with through GetYourGuide.</p><br>
			
			<p>We will not disclose your credit card number, paypal account, bank account number or any other financial information to any entity you have a transaction with through GetYourGuide, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with a subpoena or other legal process.</p><br><br>
			
			<p class="green">How we share personal information with other parties</p><br>
			
			<p>We may share your personal information with:</p><br>
			
			<ul>
			<li>Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations; (fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, market research technology services). Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.</li>
			<li>Credit bureaus to report outstanding negative balance accounts, as allowed by law.</li>
			<li>Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when</li>
				<ul>
					<li>we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure</li>
					<li>we need to do so to comply with law</li>
					<li>we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our Terms and Conditions.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.</li>
			</ul><br>
			
			<p>We also may share your information in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, and in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. Should such a corporate transaction occur, we will require that the new corporate or legal entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information could be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.</p><br>
			
			<p>Your profile on GetYourGuide will be publicly viewable and identifiable via your screen name. Unless you are engaging in a tour transaction with another GetYourGuide user, we will not share your email address with any other users nor display it in any public manner. If you wish to communicate with a GetYourGuide user, you may leave a comment or question on his or her public profile or on one of his or her tour offerings. After confirmation of a tour booking, mutual contact information will be provided to users involved in the transaction.</p><br>
			
			<p>GetYourGuide will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties in the normal course of doing business and only shares your personal information with third parties as described in this policy. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize our services and content.</p><br>
			
			<p>We may aggregate personal information from all of our users and provide that information in the aggregate to other parties, including advertisers, for marketing and promotional purposes. However, if we do so, that information will not be in a form that will allow any third party to identify you personally.</p><br><br>
			
			<p class="green">How we protect and store personal information</p><br>
			
			<p>Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.</p>
			<br>
			
			<p>We store and process your personal information on our computers in Switzerland, and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.</p><br>
			
			<p>To improve services and enhance personalization, we may periodically obtain information about you from other independent third-party sources and add it to your registration information. Additionally, authorized GetYourGuide personnel may update your registration information to accurately reflect any new information included in communications received from you.</p><br>
			
			<p>However, please know that there is no way for us to guarantee the security of your personal information. No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of GetYourGuide to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal information, GetYourGuide cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.</p><br>
			
			<p>Under no circumstances, including but not limited to negligence, shall GetYourGuide be liable for any special, incidental or consequential damages that result from the use of the information or materials on GetYourGuide, even if GetYourGuide or an authorized representative of GetYourGuide, has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p><br><br>
			
			<p class="green">How you can access or change your personal information</p><br>
			
			<p>You can review your personal information and make any necessary changes, at any time by logging in to your account and changing your preferences in the Settings page of the "My Profile" tab.</p><br><br>
			
			<p class="green">Public Forum</p><br>
			
			<p>Information posted to message boards, blogs, chat areas, clubs and public profile pages is available to the general public and becomes public information. In addition, the site offers to visitors the possibility to provide their own content. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. Users of chat areas, blogs and message boards must follow acceptable standards of behavior when posting messages online. GetYourGuide reserves the right to, but is not obligated to, refuse or delete any content that in our sole discretion is considered inappropriate.</p><br><br>
			
			<p class="green">Children's Policy</p><br>
			
			<p>No information is permitted to be either submitted to, or posted on, our website by users under the age of 18. GetYourGuide relies on our users to be truthful in responding to the question of age. GetYourGuide will not provide any personally identifying information about users under the age of 18, regardless of its source.</p><br>
			
			<p>Should a child whom we know to be under 18 send personal information to us, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him about our children�s policy.</p><br><br>
			
			<p class="green">Choice to Opt-Out</p><br>
			
			<p>We give users the option to close their account, remove their all their personal information from our database at any time and to not receive future communications and to no longer receive the membership benefits of our service. To do so, please go to your �My Profile� page. You can find the option to close your account at: Settings &gt; Account Information &gt; Close Account.</p><br><br>
			
			<p class="green">Links to Third Parties</p><br>
			
			<p>This site may contain links to sites other than our own. Those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as GetYourGuide. Such links may be to advertisers, content providers or partners who may use our logo and/or style as a result of a co-branding or application service provider agreements. These sites may send their own cookies to you, and may collect information and use it in a way inconsistent with GetYourGuide's privacy policy. Such sites may contain information that content providers independent of GetYourGuide have created, maintained, published, posted or otherwise made available.</p><br>
			
			<p>The use of any information or materials that you may access at these external sites is purely voluntary. You should not rely on the contents without independent and thorough review of the accuracy, completeness, effectiveness, timeliness and correct sequencing. These external sites may also refer to specific commercial products, processes, or services by trade name, trademark, service mark, manufacturer or otherwise. Unless GetYourGuide has provided explicit authority, such references in no way indicate our endorsement, recommendation or preference.</p><br><br>
			
			<p class="green">Changes to this Privacy Policy</p><br>
			
			<p>We reserve the right to change this policy should we deem it advisable to do so. If we make substantial changes that will affect personal information we have already collected from you, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the changes and to give you the opportunity to amend or cancel your registration.</p><br><br>
			
			<p class="green">How you can contact us about privacy questions</p><br>
			
			<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy, you should contact us by using this form (LINK) or writing to us at (LINK).</p><br><br>
