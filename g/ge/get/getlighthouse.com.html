<h3 id="share_personal_information">Will Get Lighthouse Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?</h3>
<p><b>Get Lighthouse neither rents nor sells personal data to anyone.</b>&nbsp;We will share your personal data with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. We may employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your personal data with them to have them assist us in providing our products or services to you. Get Lighthouse will enter into a written agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this Privacy Policy or any other applicable Get Lighthouse privacy and data protection commitments. Unless we give you the choice to opt-out and you do not exercise your opt-out right, we do not provide Get Lighthouse’s service providers with any right to use personal data we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us or for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You hereby consent to our sharing of personal data for the above purposes.</p>
<p>We may release personal data when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with any law or requests from law enforcement or government; enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Get Lighthouse, our employees, our customers, or others.&nbsp;<b>We will not sell your personal data to any company or organization,</b> but we may transfer your personal data to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Get Lighthouse participates or to a purchaser or acquirer of all or substantially all of Get Lighthouse’s assets to which this Site relates. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal data, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal data.</p>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
<p>Get Lighthouse takes steps that are reasonably designed to protect personal data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, including through secure socket layer, password protection and, for certain transmissions to our Services, encryption. We also have internal measures designed to protect personal data.  However, due to the open communication nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and the Site, and the Site and you, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Users of the Site do so at their own risk with respect to such communications.</p>
<h3 id="retention">Retention</h3>
<p>We retain personal data for as long as we have a legitimate need to retain it.  Generally, we will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the Services and we also may continue to retain backup or archival copies of your information made in the normal course of business. We will delete your personal data 1 year after you have run your last survey within the Services.  If you have a trial agreement with us, we will retain your personal data for 30 days after termination of your trial.  We also will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<h3 id="social">Social Plugins on Our Services</h3>
<p>We may use social plugins on our Services and may include icons that allow you to interact with third party social networks such as, without limitation, Facebook, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn and Pocket.

<p>Your use of these social plugins is subject to the privacy policies of the third party social networks.</p>
<h3 id="changes_to_policy">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Get Lighthouse may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. If we make changes in the way we use personal data, we will notify you by posting an amendment to the Privacy Policy on the Site and we will send registered users a notice of the change prior to the change becoming effective. Such modifications will become effective on the day they are posted. As such, Get Lighthouse encourages you to frequently review this Privacy Policy for any modifications.</p>

We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p>In your request, please make clear what personal data you would like to have accessed, changed or deleted.
