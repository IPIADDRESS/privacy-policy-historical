						<p>This policy discloses the information gathering and use practices of Moz Holdings Canada Incorporated (referred to as “STAT”, “we”, “us”, or “our”, below), including on our website: www.getSTAT.com (“Website”).</p>
<div class="priv">
<div class="intro">
<p>We’re all about respecting and protecting your privacy. (Kind of like Vegas, what happens on our website, stays on our website.) We also aim to be as transparent as possible about how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information, so please, familiarize yourself with this Policy. By visiting the Website or otherwise using any STAT online service, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy and Security Policy.</p>
<p>“What?! You want my personal information?” Don’t worry — it’s not too personal. For the purpose of this Policy, “personal information” means information about an identifiable individual, but excludes the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee or volunteer of an organization (if this exclusion is applicable in your jurisdiction). We won’t collect, use, or disclose your personal information in a way that is incompatible with this Policy. Because that’s just shady.</p>

<h4>1. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW IT’S USED</h4>
<h5>Cookies and Web Logs</h5>
<p>This Website uses permanent cookies (mmm, cookies) to track the use of the Website in order to better the user experience and content delivered. These aren’t the kind of cookies you eat, rather these cookies are small files saved in the memory of your internet access device that track, save, and store information about your interaction with the Website. Basically, we want to know what you like so we can give you more of it! If you don’t like the idea of cookies (but seriously, who doesn’t like cookies?), you can disable them in your browser.</p>
<p>Here are the things that collect permanent cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Analytics – to track Website traffic and usage</li>
<li>Google Tag Manager – to track links and social media platforms</li>
<li>Pardot – to track Website traffic, usage, landing pages, forms, and content</li>
<li>Disqus – to enable comments on our Blog</li>
</ul>
<p>And here’s the kind of information we collect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your internet location (IP address)</li>
<li>The web page you came from to get to our Website</li>
<li>The browser and device type you are using to access the Website</li>
<li>The date(s) and time(s) you visit the Website</li>
<li>The pages you visit and links clicked on our Website</li>
<li>Information from the forms you view and complete</li>
<li>The content you download</li>
</ul>
<h5>Answering Queries &amp; Downloading Content</h5>
<p>If you want to ask us a question or maybe just say “hi”, you can contact us through a form or email address that appears on the Website. If you do, we’ll ask for some personal information, including your name and email address, because it helps to know who we’re talking to in order to best answer reply.</p>
<p>You might be asked to provide some personal information prior to downloading content from the Website. Nothing too personal though. In this case, the communication sent to you will be related to your download request.</p>
<h4>2. OUR OPT-IN POLICY</h4>
<p>We collect personal information only when you voluntarily provide it, either expressly or by implication (for example, by using our Website) and will send communication to you only if there is express or implied consent. Typically, we will seek consent for the use or disclosure of your personal information at the time of collection. In certain circumstances, consent may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, when we want to use information for a purpose not previously identified).</p>
<p>As the great philosopher Fleetwood Mac once said, “you can go your own way”. If you ever change your mind and want to revoke consent for us to use your personal information or opt-out of receiving communication from STAT, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@getSTAT.com">contact@getSTAT.com</a> or click “Unsubscribe” or “Update Email Preferences” at the bottom of the email. Although, we’ll be sad to see you go. Note that there may be legal or contractual restrictions with respect to revoking consent, including that we may not be able to provide you with services in the future. If this is the case, we’ll inform you of the implications of withdrawing consent when the request is made.</p>
<h4>3. UPDATING, ACCESSING, OR DELETING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>You’ve got control over the information we have on you in our database. You may update your name or any other information at any time. Or if you’d like to inquire about what information we have on you or would like to be deleted from our database altogether, we’re happy to comply.</p>
<p>For any of these requests, simply send an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:contact@getSTAT.com">contact@getSTAT.com</a>&nbsp;with the subject line “Personal information” and we’ll get back to you within two business days.</p>
<h4>4. PROTECTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>Your information is safe and sound with us. We use commercially reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from loss, unauthorized access, misuse, or theft. Only super special STAT staff who have a legitimate business purpose for accessing the personal information collected are authorized to do so. Any unauthorized access to or use of personal information by anyone affiliated with STAT is prohibited and constitutes grounds for disciplinary action. In other words, they’re in some big-time trouble.</p>
<p>“Commercially reasonable? What the heck does that even mean?” Basically, we use encryption or cloud based services that have security systems in place to protect your personal and account information. Your personal information is retained by us for so long as permitted by applicable laws.</p>
<h4>5. DISCLOSING YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
<p>We’re good guys and girls and we’ll never sell, rent, or disclose your personal information unless we have a legal obligation to do so, or if we have to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements.</p>
<p>The only time we’d have to disclose personal information about our members to a third party is if (a) a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, or court order legally requires or authorizes us to do so; or (b) it’s necessary to enforce and protect the terms and conditions of our agreement(s) with you or the Terms of Use applicable to our Website.</p>
<h4>6. Links to Third Party Sites</h4>
<p>Just like pretty much every other website out there, our Website contains links to third party websites. STAT’s not responsible for how these third parties collect, use, or disclose your personal information, or their cookie policy, so it is important to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of these websites.</p>
<h4>Contacting Us</h4>
<p>If you have any questions about this Policy, your interaction with the Website, or if you have reason to believe that we may have failed to adhere to this Policy, feel free to contact us:</p>
