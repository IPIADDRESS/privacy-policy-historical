	Cookies
</div>

Similar to other commercial websites, the technology called "cookies" may be 
used to provide you with tailored information. A cookie is a small piece of 
data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your 
hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. You may be able to set your 
browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. Our cookies collect general 
information that enhances our ability to serve you and measure the utility of

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 12px; font-weight:bold; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 8px">
	Information Security
</div>

We believe that keeping personal information secure is one of our most 
significant responsibilities. We restrict access to Personal Information about 
you to those employees and others who need to know that information to assist 
us in our business, or to provide products or services to you. We safeguard 
personal information, according to established security standards and 
procedures, by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards for 
the information.
<br><br>
When we request customers to enter sensitive information (such as the credit 
card number), it is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software 
in the industry -- SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the 
lock icon at the bottom of web browsers, such as Netscape Navigator and 
Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, 
when you are just 'surfing'.
<br><br>
All of our customers' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned 
above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to 
perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk, or a customer service 
representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
