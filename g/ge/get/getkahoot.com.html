          <p><em>Last updated 25 June 2016</em>
</p><p>Kahoot! AS (“Kahoot”) is concerned about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information.  This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through websites operated by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (the “<strong>Websites</strong>”), through the software applications made available by us for use on or through computers and mobile devices (the “<strong>Apps</strong>”), and through HTML-formatted email messages that we send that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, including the Websites and Apps, the “<strong>Services</strong>”).  By providing Personal Information to us, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
</p><p><strong><a href="#children-policy">PLEASE SEE BELOW FOR OUR POLICY REGARDING OUR COLLECTION OF INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER AGE 13</a></strong>
</p><p><strong>WHAT IS KAHOOT?</strong>
</p><p>Kahoot provides a game-based learning tool that can be played through most web browsers (at <a href="http://kahoot.it/">http://kahoot.it</a>) and through our App.  A Kahoot game (referred to as a “Kahoot”) consists of players answering multiple-choice questions presented on the screen of the user who hosts the particular game.
</p><p><strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>
</p><p><strong>Personal Information We May Collect</strong>
</p><p>We do not collect any Personal Information from a person who merely plays a Kahoot.  In order to be able to create and host a Kahoot, however, a user (“accountholder”) must create an account at <a href="https://create.kahoot.it/account/register/">https://create.kahoot.it/account/register/</a>.  As described in more detail below, we may collect, use and disclose Personal Information from users 13 years of age or older who have created an account with us (“adult accountholders”).
</p><p>Our information practices are different with respect to younger users.  Specifically, when a user who is under the age of 13<strong> </strong>creates an account (a “child accountholder”), we collect his or her email address only for the purpose of providing password reminders to him or her.  We collect no other Personal Information from child accountholders, and we immediately and permanently alter the email address such that it can only be used as a password reminder and cannot be reconstructed into its original form or used to contact the child accountholder.  Kahoot also collects a user name and password from child accountholders, which are used for login purposes only.
</p><p>“<strong>Personal Information</strong>” is information that identifies an adult accountholder as an individual or relates to an identifiable person, including:
</p><ul><li>Name</li>
	<li>Email address </li>
	<li>Profile picture</li>
	<li>Biographical information (for      some teachers who elect to provide it)</li>
</ul><p>If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p><p><strong>How We May Collect Personal Information </strong>
</p><p>We and our service providers may collect Personal Information from adult accountholders in a variety of ways, including:
</p><ul><li><strong>Through the Services</strong>:  We may collect Personal      Information through the Services, e.g., when you create an account or      populate your profile.</li>
	<li><strong>Offline</strong>:  We may collect Personal      Information from you offline, such as when you contact customer service.       </li>
	<li><strong>From Other Sources</strong>:  We may receive your      Personal Information from other sources, such as public databases, joint      marketing partners and other third parties.  </li>
</ul><p><strong>How We May Use Personal Information</strong>
</p><p>We may use Personal Information collected from adult accountholders:
</p><ul><li>To respond to your inquiries      and fulfill your requests, such as to send you newsletters.</li>
	<li>To send administrative      information to you, such as information regarding the Services and changes      to our terms, conditions and policies.  </li>
	<li>To send you marketing      communications that we believe may be of interest to you, subject to your      consent if required by applicable law.</li>
	<li>To personalize your experience      on the Services by presenting products and offers tailored to you.</li>
	<li>To allow you to participate in      sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions and to administer these      activities.  Some of these activities have additional rules, which      could contain additional information about how we use and disclose your      Personal Information.  We suggest that you read any such rules      carefully.</li>
	<li>To allow you to share Kahoots      through the Services, and to notify you when a Kahoot is shared with you      or when a Kahoot you have created is featured to others on the Services.       </li>
	<li>For our business purposes, such      as data analysis, audits, fraud monitoring and prevention, developing new      products, enhancing, improving or modifying our Services, identifying      usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns      and operating and expanding our business activities.  </li>
	<li>As we believe to be necessary      or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country      of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests      from public and government authorities, including public and government      authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms      and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our      affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or      that of our affiliates, you or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue      available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. </li>
</ul><p><strong>How Personal Information May Be Disclosed</strong>
</p><p>The Personal Information of adult accountholders may be disclosed:
</p><ul><li>To our third party service      providers who provide services such as website hosting, data analysis,      information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer      service, email delivery, auditing and other services.</li>
	<li>To third-party sponsors of      sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions.</li>
	<li>To identify you to anyone with      whom you share a Kahoot or other messages through the Services. </li>
	<li>By you, on profile pages and      other services to which you are able to post information and materials.       Please note that any information you post or disclose through these      services will become public and may be available to other users and the      general public.  We urge you to be very careful when deciding to      disclose any information on the Services.</li>
	<li>To a third party in the event      of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer      or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock      (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</li>
	<li>As we believe to be necessary      or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your      country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to      requests from public and government authorities, including public and      government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce      our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of      any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or      property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others; and (g) to allow      us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. </li>
</ul><p><strong>OTHER INFORMATION</strong>
</p><p><strong>Other Information We May Collect</strong>
</p><p>“<strong>Other Information</strong>” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual, such as:
</p><ul><li>Browser and device information</li>
	<li>App usage data</li>
	<li>Information collected through      cookies, pixel tags and other technologies</li>
	<li>Demographic information and      other information provided by you</li>
	<li>Aggregated      information</li>
</ul><p>If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it for the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information as detailed in this Policy.
</p><p><strong>How We May Collect Other Information </strong>
</p><p>We and our third party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:
</p><p><strong>Through your browser or device</strong>:  Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the Services (such as the App) you are using.  We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.
</p><p><strong>Through your use of the App</strong>:  When you download and use the App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information has been downloaded to the App based on your device number.
</p><p><strong>Using cookies</strong>:  Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using.  Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data.  We and our service providers use the information only to support the internal operations of the Services, such as for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience while using the Services and to recognize your computer in order to assist your use of the Services.  We also gather statistical information about use of the Services in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used and assist us with resolving questions regarding them.
</p><p>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site.  You may also wish to refer to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html</a>.  If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services.  For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit.
</p><p><strong>Using pixel tags and</strong> <strong>other similar technologies</strong>:  Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Services to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Services (including adult accountholders that may receive emails from us), measure the success of marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services and response rates.
</p><p><strong>Analytics</strong>: We use third parties, including Google Analytics, which use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Services and report on activities and trends.  You can learn about Google’s practices by going to <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/‌partners/</a>, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.
</p><p><strong>IP Address</strong>:  Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).  An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.  Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services.  We use IP addresses for the purposes of providing support for the internal operations of the Services, such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems, and administering the Services.  We may also derive your approximate, general, location from your IP address.
</p><p><strong>From you</strong>: Information such as your communications preference may be collected from adult accountholders when they voluntarily provide it.
</p><p><strong>By aggregating information</strong>:  Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services.
</p><p><strong>How We May Use and Disclose Other Information </strong>
</p><p>We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.  In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information.  If we do, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p>
