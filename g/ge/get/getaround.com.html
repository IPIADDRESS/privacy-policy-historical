We also collect a copy of your driver’s license and billing and payment information if you utilize our Service. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address, and our responses. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service. You may provide us information in User Content you post to the Service.</p><h4>Payment Information</h4><p>Getaround collects your personal payment information, including information stored on outside services that you may use with Getaround, such as PayPal.

By registering with Getaround, you authorize us to access your driver's record from state DMVs, RMVs, and other applicable entities, and this authorization extends to Getaround throughout the entire time you use our Service, so that Getaround may re-check your records from time to time. You also authorize said entities to release this information to Getaround.</p><h4>Vehicle History and Inspection</h4><p>If you own a vehicle that is used on Getaround, we will inspect the vehicle, collect information identifying the vehicle (like a license plate number, VIN), and obtain a vehicle history report to make sure the vehicle is safe for you and other drivers to use.
