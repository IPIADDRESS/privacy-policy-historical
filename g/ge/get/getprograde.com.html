	<br>
	Ultimate Wellness Systems, Inc., a Florida corporation, (“UWS” or “we”) is engaged in the business of selling its Prograde Nutritional products and other services over the Internet through its web site, <a href="" target="_blank">http://Getprograde.com</a>, and web sites operated by its active affiliates.&nbsp; As used in this Privacy Policy, the term “Web Site” refers to any web site where this Privacy Policy is posted.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	When you access or use this Web Site, UWS may collect personally identifiable information from you, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, and any other information that may identify you (“Personal Information,” as further described below).&nbsp; This Privacy Policy describes the Personal Information we may obtain from you, how we may use or share your Personal Information, and how you can control our collection and use of such Personal Information.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	By accessing, using, or providing Personal Information to us through this Web Site, you agree, without limitation or qualification, to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not access or use this Web Site or provide Personal Information to us through this Web Site. </p>

	  <strong>Secure Shopping</strong><br>
	When you place orders on our Web Site, all of your order information, including your card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology causes your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our secure server. SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of our Sites from capturing and viewing your Personal Information. Since any order information you provide to us on our Web Site will be transmitted using a secure connection, if your Web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our Web Site. The most recent versions of commonly used Internet browsers can usually support a secure connection and can be downloaded for free from the web sites for those browsers.</p>
