		</p><h3>2. Information We Collect.</h3>
		
		Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience easier. 
		<br><br>
In general, you can browse our site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to use our services, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, tax identification number, Dunn &amp; Bradstreet number, e-mail address, mailing address and other information as indicated on the forms throughout our site. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional.

We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on our site. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address.
		<br><br>
We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of our site to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our site and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session.
