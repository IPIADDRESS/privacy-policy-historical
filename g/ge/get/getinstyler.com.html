Subject to the requirements of applicable law, we strive to provide a consistent set of privacy practices throughout the InStyler web site.
		<br><br>
By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in registration, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your identifiable information. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the InStyler User Agreement.

	<p>
		</p><h3>2. Information We Collect.</h3>
		
		Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience easier. 
		<br><br>
In general, you can browse our site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to use our services, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, tax identification number, Dunn &amp; Bradstreet number, e-mail address, mailing address and other information as indicated on the forms throughout our site. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional.
		<br><br>
We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on our site. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address.
		<br><br>
We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of our site to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our site and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session.

		</p><h3>4. Our Disclosure of Your Information.</h3>
Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private. 
		<br><br>
As a matter of policy, we may sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed. We will be gathering credit applications via the website, we reserve the right to "sell" or "market" that information to other vendors as a credit reference source.
		<br><br>
Legal Requests. InStyler cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.

To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy policies. Since InStyler does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

	<p>
		</p><h3>6. Security.</h3>
The InStyler web site uses industry standard practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, including "firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers. InStyler treats data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. <p></p>
