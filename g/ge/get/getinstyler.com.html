        		</p><h3>Overview </h3>
				
				The privacy practices of this statement apply to our services available under the domain and sub-domains of instyler.com. By visiting this website you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree please do not use or access our services.

        		<br><br>

				As described below, as part of the normal operation of our services, your information is collected by us, may be disclosed to third parties and might be used by third parties and us. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you and what may happen to that information. Although this policy may seem long, we have prepared a detailed policy because we believe you should know as much as possible about Instyler®'s practices so that you can make informed decisions. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, we strive to provide a consistent set of privacy practices throughout the Instyler® web site.

        		<br><br>

				By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in registration, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your identifiable information. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the Instyler® User Agreement.

				</p><h3>1. A Special Note About Children.</h3>

        		Children are not eligible to use our services (under the age of 18). 
    		<p></p>

    		<p>
        		</p><h3>2. Information We Collect.</h3>

        		Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience easier. 

        		<br><br>

				In general, you can browse our site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to use our services, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, tax identification number, Dunn &amp; Bradstreet number, e-mail address, mailing address and other information as indicated on the forms throughout our site. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional.

 				<br><br>

				We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on our site. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address.

        		<br><br>

				We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of our site to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our site and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session. 
    		<p></p>

    		<p>
        		</p><h3>3. Our Use of Your Information.</h3>

				We use your information to facilitate the services you request. We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the site, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our various Agreements. 

        		<br><br>

				You agree that we may use personally identifiable information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve our site and better tailor it to meet your needs.     

        		<br><br>

				You agree that we may use your information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the site. By accepting the User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information. If you do not wish to receive these communications, we encourage you to opt out of the receipt of certain communications by e-mailing "<a href="mailto:customerservice@getinstyler.com">customerservice@getinstyler.com</a>."

    		<p>

        		</p><h3>4. Our Disclosure of Your Information.</h3>

				Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private. 

        		<br><br>

				As a matter of policy, we may sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed. We will be gathering credit applications via the website, we reserve the right to "sell" or "market" that information to other vendors as a credit reference source.

        		<br><br>

				Legal Requests. Instyler® cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your, name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email, and company name as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation.

			<p>
        		</p><h3>5. Other Information Collectors.</h3>

				Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy policies. Since Instyler® does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
			<p></p>

    		<p>

        		</p><h3>6. Security.</h3>

				The Instyler® web site uses industry standard practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, including "firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers. Instyler® treats data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
			<p></p>

    		<p>

        		</p><h3>7. Conflict of Terms.</h3>

				It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand. We have created easy-to-read summaries, privacy principles and, are working on privacy enhancing technology to help summarize our full privacy policy. If you have questions about any part of this summary or if you would like more detailed information, we encourage you to review our full privacy policy.
			<p></p>
