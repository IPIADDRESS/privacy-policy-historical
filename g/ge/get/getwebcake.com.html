<h2>WEBCAKE PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<h4><em>Last updated: July 11, 2013</em></h4>

<h3>1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>
	This Privacy Policy is part of the WebCake (the "Company", "we" or "us") End User License Agreement available at <a href="/Terms">License Agreement</a>, and applies to all users
	of the WebCake toolbar software (the "Software"). The Software is supported by advertising (including search, banner, text link, transitional, interstitial
	and full page), which is not associated with or endorsed by any underlying websites.
</p>
<p>
	This Privacy Policy describes the collection and use of Software users' personal information (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as
	full name and address), and non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is
	associated with a particular user. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal
	information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a
	child under age 13, please contact us immediately at the email address in the last paragraph below.
</p>
<h3>2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h3>
<h4>User Submitted Information</h4>
<p>
	When contacting us, you may submit personal information (such as your full name and other identifying information) to allow us to effectively respond to
	your inquiry. Your submission is voluntary and you have the choice not to disclose any information to us. Your user submitted information may also include
	user names associated with third party services, information or content you have permitted third parties to share with the Company, and any information you
	have made public in connection with third party services. In addition, the Company may supplement user submitted information with other information
	collected or obtained from third parties.
</p>
<h4>Collected Information</h4>
<p>
	<strong>Accessing and Using the Software.</strong>
	When using the Software, certain non-personally identifiable information is collected, stored and used for business and marketing purposes, such as
	maintaining and improving the Software, conducting research, and displaying more relevant advertisements. Such information may be transferred to servers that are located in the United States for these purposes. This non-personally identifiable information
	includes, without limitation: IP address, unique identifier number, operating system, browser information, URLs visited, pages viewed, search queries
	entered, and other software and hardware information. This collected data may also be supplemented with information obtained from third parties or
	submitted by users.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tracking and Data Collection Technologies.</strong>
	The Company may use browser cookies, web and DOM storage data, Adobe Flash cookies, pixels, beacons, and other tracking and data collection technologies,
	which may include an anonymous unique identifier. These technologies may be used to collect and store information about your use of the Software while
	browsing websites, including without limitation, web pages, features and content you have accessed, search queries you have run, referral URL information,
	links you have clicked on, and advertisements you have seen. This data is used for business purposes such as providing more relevant ads and content, and
	market research. The Company may also use these technologies and other similar tools to relate your use of the Software to personal information obtained
	from you or a reputable third party. For example, cookie, click stream or other data about your activities using the Software may allow us to refine the
	ads, offers and content provided to you through the Software to items we think you will find interesting and relevant to you, based on your prior online
	activities and preferences.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Third Party Tracking and Data Collection.</strong>
	Third parties that support the Software by serving advertisements or providing other services, such as tracking aggregate site usage or providing users
	with the ability to comment on or share content, may also use cookies, pixels and other tracking and data collection technologies described above to
	collect user information. The Company does not control these third parties and their use of these technologies is governed by the privacy policies of the
	third parties using such technologies.
</p>

</p>
<p>
	<strong>To allow third party service providers to assist us.</strong>
	The Company may make your non-public personal information available to certain third party service providers, such as contractors, agents or sponsors, who
	help us manage the Software or provide Software content, advertisements and other services. Examples of such services include, without limitation:
	advertising and marketing, developing or supporting products and features, processing payments, processing data or statistics, and supplementing or

	and other technologies to collect and track non-personally identifiable information such as aggregated information, demographic information, interests,

	notify us of the problem and uninstall the Software immediately.
</p>

	Software, certain related files may remain on your system. These remnant files are a record of your previous download and are not executable programs.

	The Software is hosted in the United States and the Company is based in the United States. If you are a user located outside of the U.S., you understand

	other privacy laws may not offer the same level of protection as in your jurisdiction, such as the European Union. This includes the use of cookies and
	other tracking technologies as described above.
