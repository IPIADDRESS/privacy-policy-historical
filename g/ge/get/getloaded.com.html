COOKIES<br>
A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. We use one type of cookie to maintain your login information for as long as you are using the Site. No Personal Information is stored in this cookie and the cookie is deleted from your computer when you leave the Site.

This website uses a variety of analytics services to understand customer interactions with the site in order to optimize the delivery of new features and functions. These analytic services include but are not limited to Google Analytics, Visual Web Optimizer, Segment, Optimizely and Amplitude.<br>
<br>
The analytic services use “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by the analytic services on servers in the U.S. If the IP anonymization is activated, analytic services will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. In exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by servers in the U.S.<br>
<br>
On behalf of the website provider analytic services will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Site, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website provider. The analytic services will not associate your IP address with any other data held by them.<br>
<br>
You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.<br>
<br>
Please note that on this website, analytics services code is supplemented by “anonymizeIp” to ensure an anonymized collection of IP addresses within the EU and EEA (IP-masking).<br>
<br>
THIRD-PARTY SITES<br>
The Site may contain links to other third-party sites. When you click on one of these links you are visiting a website operated by someone other than us and the operator of that website may have a different privacy policy.
