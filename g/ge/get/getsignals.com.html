<div>Our online Subscription Service allows any company that uses it (our customers and HubSpot itself) to build marketing webpages on our servers where visitors can learn more about the company, download content, and provide their contact information and other demographic information. This information, which is stored and managed on our service providers' servers, is then used so that the visitors can be contacted about their interest in the company's goods or services and interact with the company. HubSpot provides the Subscription Service to our customers for their own marketing and lead generation, and we use it on our Websites for our own marketing and lead generation.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

Our agreements with our customers prohibit us from using that information, except as necessary to provide and improve the Subscription Service, as permitted by this Privacy Policy, and as required by law. We have no direct relationship with individuals who provide Personal Information to our customers. Our customers control and are responsible for correcting, deleting or updating information they have collected from you using the Subscription Service. &nbsp;We may work with our customers to help them provide notice to their visitors about their data collection, processing and usage. Our agreements with our customers prohibit them from using the Subscription Service to collect, manage, or process Sensitive Information.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<h2><strong>4. How We Use Information We Collect</strong></h2>

We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, we do not transfer your unique Personal Information to the third party. In addition, we may share data with trusted partners to contact you based on your request to receive such communications, help us perform statistical analysis, or provide customer support. Such third parties are prohibited from using your Personal Information except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>4.4. Use of Navigational Information </strong></div>
<div>We use Navigational Information to operate and improve the Websites and the Subscription Service. We may also use Navigational Information alone or in combination with Personal Information to provide you with personalized information about HubSpot.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>4.5. Customer Testimonials and Comments </strong></div>
<div>We post customer testimonials and comments on our Websites, which may contain Personal Information. We obtain each customer's consent via email prior to posting the customer's name and testimonial.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>4.6. Use of Credit Card Information </strong></div>
<div>If you give us credit card information, we use it solely to check your financial qualifications and collect payment from you. We use a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>4.7. Service Providers </strong></div>
<div>We employ other companies and people to provide services to visitors to our Websites, our customers, and users of the Subscription Service and may need to share your information with them to provide information, products or services to you. Examples may include removing repetitive information from prospect lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, supplementing the information you provide us in order to provide you with better service, and providing customer service. In all cases where we share your information with such agents, we explicitly require the agent to acknowledge and adhere to our privacy and customer data handling policies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>4.8. Security of your Personal Information </strong></div>
<div>We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We secure the Personal Information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When sensitive Personal Information (such as a credit card number&nbsp;<span>and/or geo-location data</span>) is collected on our Websites and/or transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>4.9. Social Media Features </strong></div>
<div>Our Websites include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these features. &nbsp;Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy and other policies of the companies providing them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>4.10. External Websites </strong></div>
<div>Our Websites provide links to other websites. We do not control, and are not responsible for, the content or practices of these other websites. Our provision of such links does not constitute our endorsement of these other websites, their content, their owners, or their practices. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these other websites, which are subject to any privacy and other policies they may have.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>4.11. Public Forums</strong></div>
<div>We offer publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose any information through our public message boards, blogs, or forums, this information may be collected and used by others. We will correct or delete any information you have posted on the Websites if you so request, as described in "Opting Out and Unsubscribing" below.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>4.12. Retention of Personal Information </strong></div>
<div>We retain Personal Information that you provide us as long as we consider it potentially useful in contacting you about the Subscription Service or our other services, and then we securely delete the information. We will delete this information from the servers at an earlier date if you so request, as described in "Opting Out and Unsubscribing" below. If you provide information to our customers as part of their use of the Subscription Service, our customers decide how long to retain the personal information they collect from you. If a customer terminates its use of the Subscription Service, then we will provide customer with access to all information stored for the customer by the Subscription Service, including any Personal Information provided by you, for export by the customer&nbsp;<span>according to our agreement with our customer</span>. After termination, we may, unless legally prohibited, delete all customer information, including your Personal Information, from the Subscription Service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>4.13. International Transfer of Information </strong></div>
<div>To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access Personal Information from around the world, including the United States. This Privacy Policy shall apply even if we transfer Personal Information to other countries.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>4.14. Corporate Events </strong></div>
<div>If we (or our assets) are acquired by another company, whether by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or otherwise, that company would receive all information gathered by HubSpot on the Websites and the Subscription Service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>4.15. Compelled Disclosure </strong></div>
<div>We reserve the right to use or disclose your Personal Information if required by law or if we reasonably believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or to comply with a law, court order, or legal process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<h2><strong>5. Navigational Information</strong></h2>
<div><strong>5.1. Cookies</strong></div>
<div>We use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages on our Websites, or register for the Subscription Service, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. When you return to the same Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the <span>customized</span>&nbsp;features.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the HubSpot Subscription Service or Websites you visit. HubSpot keeps track of the Websites and pages you visit within HubSpot, in order to determine what portion of the HubSpot Website or Subscription Service is the most popular or most used. This data is used to deliver customized content and promotions within the HubSpot Website and Subscription Service to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>5.2. Log Files </strong></div>
<div>We may collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites using log files that are not associated with your name or other personally identifying information. There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by us. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by HubSpot for the operation of the Subscription Service, to maintain quality of the Subscription Service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the HubSpot Website. For these purposes, we do link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information such as name, email address, address, and phone number.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>5.3. Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) </strong></div>
<div>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage the Website and Subscription Service by informing us what content is effective. &nbsp;Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. &nbsp;In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages or in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. &nbsp;This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs in emails to our customers' Personal Information. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Opting Out and Unsubscribing".</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>5.4. Navigational Information Collected by Our Customers </strong></div>
<div>Our customers can use the tools we provide, as well as tools provided by third parties, to collect Navigational Information when you visit their webpages on the Subscription Service. HubSpot does not control our customers' use of these tools, nor do we control the information they collect or how they use it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>5.5. Single Sign-On </strong></div>
<div>You can log in to our site using a Single Sign-on (SSO) service like your Google account. This service will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. &nbsp;Such services may give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>5.6. Flash Cookies and Other Third Party Tracking Technologies </strong></div>
<div>The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your Web browser. This technology creates locally stored objects that are often referred to as "Flash cookies." HubSpot does not use Flash cookies. &nbsp;However, our customers of our software platform may create pages on the HubSpot platform that employ Adobe Flash cookies. &nbsp;HubSpot does not have access or control over our customers' Flash cookies, but you may access your Flash management tools from Adobe's web site directly. &nbsp; Similarly, our customers may create pages using the HubSpot Subscription Service that use technology from tracking utility companies, such as cookies and web beacons. &nbsp; The use of these technologies by our customers is not covered by our privacy statement. &nbsp;We do not have access or control over these third party tracking technologies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>5.7. Advertising </strong></div>
<div>We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. &nbsp;Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. &nbsp;If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/">http://preferences.truste.com/</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. &nbsp;You will continue to receive generic ads.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>5.8. Third Party Tracking Technologies </strong></div>
<div>The use of cookies and web beacons by any tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy statement. &nbsp;We do not have access or control over these third party tracking technologies</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<h2><strong>6. Opting Out and Unsubscribing&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>6.2. Anti-Spam Policy </strong></div>
<div>Our Acceptable Use Policy, at <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/acceptable-use">http://www.hubspot.com/acceptable-use</a>,&nbsp;applies to us and to our customers and, among other things, prohibits use of the Subscription Service to send unsolicited commercial email in violation of applicable laws, and requires the inclusion in every email sent using the Subscription Service of an "opt-out" mechanism and other required information. We require all of our customers to agree to adhere to the Acceptable Use Policy at all times, and any violations of the Acceptable Use Policy by a customer can result in immediate suspension or termination of the Subscription Service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>6.3. To Unsubscribe From Our Communications</strong></div>
<div>You may unsubscribe from our marketing communications by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link located on the bottom of our e-mails, or by sending us email us at privacy@hubspot.com, or by sending us postal mail to HubSpot, Inc., 25 First Street, 2nd Floor, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA, Attention: Privacy. Customers cannot opt out of receiving transactional emails related to their account with us or the Subscription Service.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>6.4. To Unsubscribe from Our Customers' Communications </strong></div>
