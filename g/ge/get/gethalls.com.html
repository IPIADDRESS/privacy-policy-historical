    <br><br>
    <b>Types of Information Collected Automatically</b>
    <br><br>
    When you view or interact with our sites and ads, we may automatically receive certain information. This information includes:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="TextShareInfo">Log information</span>.  Log information refers to information that is automatically sent by your web browser or device (or otherwise automatically collected by us) each time you view or interact with our sites and ads.  Log information may include the site requested (for example, the MondelezInternational.com website); date and time of your request; referring URL (i.e., the website you came from); your device's IP address; location data derived from your device's IP address; browser type; browser language; device operating system; device hardware and other characteristics; device event information (for example, crash data); information regarding your use of our sites (for example, pages viewed, features used, number of clicks, time spent on a particular page); data contained in cookies; and related device and usage data.  Log information is automatically recorded by our servers each time you view or interact with our sites and ads.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="TextShareInfo">Device information</span>.  Device information refers to device-specific information that we automatically collect when you view or interact with our sites and ads.  Device information may include your device type and model; device operating system and version; unique device and advertising identifiers; mobile network information; and related device information.  To learn more about the information your device may make available to us, please check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="TextShareInfo">Cookie data</span>.  Cookie data refers to the small text file(s) that are sent to or read by our servers when you view or interact with our sites and ads.  Cookie data may include user preferences and other information.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="TextShareInfo">Local storage data</span>.  Local storage data refers to data stored locally on your browser or device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (for example, HTML 5, Flash) and application data caches (i.e., a data repository on a device used for storing data locally in connection with a particular application).  As with cookie data, local storage data may be sent back to or read by our servers when you view or interact with our sites and ads.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="TextShareInfo">Statistical identifiers</span>.  Statistical identifiers refer to identifiers created using your device information and certain log information. This information, collectively, makes your web browser or device sufficiently distinct for our servers or similar systems to reasonably determine that they are encountering the same browser or device over time.  Statistical identifiers enable us to uniquely identify your web browser or device for the same purposes as cookies.</li>

    <br><br>
    In this privacy statement, the information described above is collectively referred to as "<span class="TextShareInfo">device and usage data</span>."
    <br><br>
    <b>Overview of Cookies and Similar Technologies</b>
    <br><br>
    We use various technologies to collect device and usage data, including cookies and similar technologies.
    <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="TextShareInfo">Cookies</span>.  Cookies are small text files that are sent to and stored by your browser or device when you view or interact with our sites and ads.  These cookies are then sent back unchanged to us each time you view or interact with our sites and ads in order for us to recognize your web browser or device.  Cookies are used by us for a number of legitimate purposes, such as authenticating users; session tracking and storing information about specific users (for example, website preferences, buying habits); analyzing traffic to our sites; tracking the number and frequency of ads that have been shown to specific browsers or devices; and related purposes.</li>
        <br>
        There are different types of cookies.  Cookies served by the entity that operates the website you are using or viewing are called <span class="TextShareInfo">first party cookies</span> (for example, cookies served by Mondelēz Global when you view or interact with our sites are first party cookies).  Cookies served by entities that are not operating the website you are viewing or interacting with are called <span class="TextShareInfo">third party cookies</span> (for example, cookies served by our online service providers when you use or view our sites, such as Google Analytics cookies, are third party cookies).  Cookies may also endure for different periods of time.  <span class="TextShareInfo">Session cookies</span> only last as long as your web browser is open, and are deleted automatically once you close your browser.  Other cookies are <span class="TextShareInfo">persistent cookies</span>, meaning they survive after your browser is closed (for example, to recognize your browser or device when you revisit our sites).
    <br>
    <br>
    <li><span class="TextShareInfo">Pixel tags</span>.  Pixel tags (also called <span class="TextShareInfo">web beacons</span>, <span class="TextShareInfo">clear GIFs</span> and <span class="TextShareInfo">action tags</span>) are small blocks of code installed on our sites and ads for a number of legitimate purposes, such as to allow us to track activity on our sites (for example, when e-mails are opened or content is viewed); to allow our online service providers to serve cookies on our sites and receive relevant device and usage data; and other purposes relating to the monitoring and analysis of the use and performance of our sites and ads.</li>
    <br>
    <li><span class="TextShareInfo">Local storage</span>.  Local storage refers generally to the storage of data locally on your browser or device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (for example, HTML 5, Flash) and application data caches.</li>
    <br>
    <li><span class="TextShareInfo">Software Development Kits</span>.  Software development kits (also called <span class="TextShareInfo">SDKs</span>) function like third party cookies and pixel tags, but operate in the mobile app context where cookies and pixel tags cannot function as effectively.  Instead, we may install pieces of code (the SDK) provided by our online service providers (for example, third party advertising companies, ad networks and analytics providers) in our mobile apps in order for our online service providers to collect and analyze relevant device and usage data.</li>
    <br>
    <li><span class="TextShareInfo">Server logs</span>.  Server logs refer to the servers used by us to receive and store device and usage data.</li>
</ul>
    In this privacy statement, the cookies and other technologies described above are collectively referred to as "<span class="TextShareInfo">cookies and similar technologies</span>."

            <td>Our sites utilize first- and third-party cookies and similar technologies to deliver, track and measure ads both on and off our sites, including ads relevant to your interests (for example, ads based on your past interaction with our sites, ads based on predictions about your interests derived from your activities on different websites over time); and ads based on your location, demographics, or computer or device characteristics.  This includes tracking and measuring the reach and frequency of ads, and regulating the delivery of such ads (for example, capping the number of times you see a particular ad). For example, we may use cookies and similar technologies to deliver relevant ads based on your location; or to group users that share a common interest into audience segments and deliver ads that may be of interest to users within a given segment; or to deliver our ads on third-party websites through a common form of online advertising known as "<span class="TextShareInfo">retargeting</span>" or "<span class="TextShareInfo">remarketing</span>."  Retargeting works by serving ads on one website based on an individual's activities on a different website (for example, if you view a product on our site, such as Oreo® cookies, you may later see ads for Oreo® cookies when you visit a third-party website).  To do this, we allow our online service providers, such as advertising agencies and ad networks, to place their own third-party cookies when users view or interact with our sites, allowing these online service providers to recognize users who have previously visited our sites.  When these users visit a third-party website that includes features provided by our online service providers (for example, where our online service providers have purchased ad space), these online service providers can then recognize the users' interest in our products and services and deliver one of our ads on the third-party website.</td>
