			<h4 class="TextCollect">Information You Provide</h4>
			At our sites, we collect information from you when you choose to share it with us to use our sites or 

services, register with our sites, sign up for newsletters or our e-mail list, sign up to receive text message alerts, 

participate in an online or text message survey or promotion, purchase products or services from us, or otherwise contact us. The 

information we collect may include your name, address, telephone number, mobile telephone number, e-mail address, age, gender, 

photo/image and, if you make a purchase on our sites, credit/debit card number or other financial information. You may also be

you can control what information is available to other members on our sites. We do not require you to register or provide this 

information to us in order to view our sites or have access to most site content.
			<h4 class="TextCollect">Information Collected Automatically</h4>
			We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, or other technologies to collect certain 

information about visitors to and users of our sites to deliver online advertisements that we think would be more relevant to 

your interests, and to monitor interactions with our emails, text messages and online advertisements. For example, we may 

automatically collect certain non-personal information from you, such as the type of web browser and operating system you use, 

the name of your Internet Service Provider, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, software version, course geolocation information 

(for example, based on IP address or location of cellular tower used for the connection), and the domain name from which you 

accessed our sites. In addition, we may collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you visit our 

sites, the areas or pages of our sites that you visit, the amount of time you spend viewing or using our sites, the number of 

times you return to our sites, other click-stream or site usage data, emails or ads that you open, forward or click-through to 

our sites. Collecting this information, and linking it with your personally-identifiable information, helps us best tailor our 

sites and enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting our sites, and to help us identify 

sites features, advertisements, and offers that may be of particular interest to you.
			<h4 class="TextCollect">Information Collected from Other Sources</h4>
			We may obtain information about you from other sources, including commercially available sources, such as 

data aggregators and public databases. This information may include name, demographic information, interests, and publicly-

observed data, such as from social media and shopping behavior.
			<h4 class="TextCollect">Combination of Information</h4>
			We may combine the information we receive from and about you, including personal and non-personal 

information collected through our sites, to help us tailor our communications to you and to improve our sites, services, and 

products.
			<h4 class="TextCollect">Information Collected Automatically by Our Partners</h4>
			We also may use third party advertisements placed by ad networks to support our sites. Some of these 

advertisers and ad networks may use technology such as cookies and web beacons/pixel tags when they advertise on our sites, which 

may send these advertisers and ad networks information including your non-personal information, such as your IP address, your 

ISP, the browser you used to visit our sites, and whether you have Flash installed. Some of these advertisers and ad networks 

also may use anonymous data, such as demographic data, received from third parties to assist in the delivery of advertisements to 

you. These advertisers and ad networks use the information described above to provide you relevant advertisements based on your

		<div class="PolicyExtMain">
		We do not sell or otherwise disclose personally-identifiable information about our sites’ visitors, except as 

described here. We do not share your personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing 

purposes without your consent. For California residents, please see <a href="#PolicyExtCalifornia" class="TextShareInfo">“Your 

California Privacy Rights”</a> below.<p>
		We may share personally identifiable information among Mondelēz Global brands, affiliates and subsidiaries. In 

the course of doing business, we employ other companies and individuals to perform a variety of functions on our behalf. For 

example, we hire agencies to help administer consumer promotions, to analyze data, to fulfill orders you place, and to provide 

customer service. These service providers may have access to personally identifiable information about our website visitors if it 

is needed to perform their functions for Mondelēz Global, but they are not authorized by Mondelēz Global to use or disclose the 

information except as necessary to perform services on Mondelēz Global’s behalf or to comply with legal requirements, and they 

are required to maintain the information in confidence. In addition, we may disclose information where we think it’s necessary to 

investigate or prevent an actual or suspected crime or injury to ourselves or others, if required by law, or in response to a 

request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials.</p><p>
		We may conduct joint promotions with other companies. We may share with our promotional partners (and their 

service providers) certain personally-identifiable information as necessary to conduct the promotion. We will not share this 

information with our promotional partners for any other purpose unless you consent to such sharing.</p><p>
		During the normal course of our business, Mondelēz Global may sell or purchase assets or equity. If another 

entity acquires us or any of our assets, information we have collected about you may be transferred to such entity. In addition, 

if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, such information may be considered an asset of ours 

and may be sold or transferred to third parties. Should a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to 

require that the transferee use personally identifiable information provided through this website in a manner that is consistent 

with this privacy statement.</p><p>
