This Privacy Policy explains our policy regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy will be assessed against new technologies, business practices, and our users' needs. As we update, expand, and diversify our products and services, this Privacy Policy may evolve.

If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here. A link to our Privacy Policy will be provided at the bottom of each web page on our Web sites and any on-line services or programs.</p>

It is your choice whether or not you provide us with your personal information; however, a decision to withhold personal information may restrict or prevent us from providing you with a particular product or service. We will only collect, use, and disclose your personal information with your consent, except where otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirement.</p>

<h3>Collection of personal information</h3>

</ol><p>The Nymi Band allows you to use biometric authentication technology [such as a template of your heart's unique ECG] to confirm your identity and allow you to access devices and services you choose to associate with the Nymi Band using the Nymi Band app. When you use the Nymi Band, an encrypted replica of your ECG signature is recorded and wirelessly transmitted to the device on which you have installed the Nymi Band app, allowing the device to confirm your identity. However, it is important to note that Nymi does not and cannot itself collect, use, view, or have access to your ECG template when you use the Nymi Band and Nymi Band app. Your ECG template is stored in an encrypted state within the Nymi Band and not transmitted to Nymi.</p>

<p>You agree that you are under no obligation to provide us with this information and can access many aspects of our Web sites without providing us any personal information.</p>

<p>While using the Web site, you may have opportunities to post reviews or other personal information in public forums at your own discretion. Please understand that when you post such information, it is public and Nymi is not able to protect it from other persons who may view the public areas of our Web site. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information in a publicly available forum such as the Web site and agree to release, indemnify, and hold harmless Nymi for any damages or claims resulting from any of your postings. Nymi is not obligated to monitor postings and at its discretion may remove any content submitted.</p>

<h3>Disclosure of your personal information</h3>

<p>Except as otherwise disclosed to you or required or permitted by applicable law, Nymi will not sell nor rent your personal information to any other party. Nymi will only use and disclose your personal information for the purposes for which it was collected as described in this Privacy Policy. However, you agree that Nymi may disclose your personal information in the circumstances set out below:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>Nymi may disclose your personal information with your prior consent;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Nymi may be required by law to disclose personal information without your knowledge or consent in the event of emergency situations or when required by government or other legal authority;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Nymi may also disclose personal information to third parties in connection with a corporate re-organization, merger or amalgamation, or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets, provided that, where appropriate, any party to whom the information is disclosed is bound by agreements or obligations, and required to use or disclose your personal information in a manner consistent with the use and disclosure provisions of this Privacy Policy, unless you consent otherwise;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Nymi may also use, or disclose your personal information to third parties, if we have reason to believe that using or disclosing such information is necessary to: (i) conduct investigations of possible breaches of law; (ii) identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating an agreement they have with us; (iii) investigate security breaches or cooperate with government authorities pursuant to a legal matter or (iv) to protect our rights, safety or property; or</p>
	</li>

For example, we may hire other companies to handle the processing of payments, collect debts, to provide data storage, to host websites, to fulfill orders, to assist in direct marketing, to conduct audits, etc. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to provide the service. Each company is bound by agreement or obligations with Nymi to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices in order to use and disclose your personal information in a manner consistent with the use and disclosure provisions of this Privacy Policy, unless you consent otherwise.</p>
	</li>
</ol><h3>How to opt-out / withdraw consent</h3>

<p>Subject to legal and contractual obligations where applicable, you can withdraw your consent for the use of your personal information you have provided to us, you should do so either through links provided in communications to you or by visiting forums.nymi.com and selecting â€˜preferencesâ€™. You must be signed in to access your â€˜preferencesâ€™.</p>

<p>Information may be retained by Nymi for audit or archival purposes or as required by applicable federal and provincial laws.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to receive marketing communications, you may follow the "unsubscribe" instructions included within each email communication or by selecting or deselecting (depending on the service) the appropriate option through links provided in communications to you. Please keep in mind that, even if you choose not to receive marketing communications, you may continue to receive transactional or account communications related to services or products that you have requested (e.g. purchase confirmation emails and receipts).</p>

<h3>How long we keep personal information</h3>

<p>Nymi maintains information about you for as long as we provide a product and/or service to you, and longer for related business activities. After information is no longer necessary for our business purposes, we destroy the information unless there is an outstanding request or order to preserve the information.</p>

<h3>Safeguards we have in place</h3>

<p>Nymi stores and processes your personal information on computers located in Canada and in the cloud internationally. Nymi employs reasonable physical, organizational, managerial and technical measures to help ensure that your personal information is secure. In addition, our dedicated team of information technology professionals works to maintain data accuracy and help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. Personal information may only be accessed by persons within our organization, or our third party service providers, who require such access to carry out the purposes indicated above.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information and cannot assume liability for improper access to it. The Internet is not a secure medium and you acknowledge and agree that the privacy of your email communication and personal information can never be guaranteed as any email communication may be lost, intercepted or altered. By using our Web sites, or providing personal information to us through any means, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of our Web sites and our services.</p>

<p>Some or all of the personal information we collect may be stored or processed on servers located outside your jurisdiction of residence, including in the United States, whose data protection laws may differ from the jurisdiction in which you live. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions. Subject to applicable laws in such other jurisdictions, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that appropriate protections are in place to require the data processor in that country to maintain protections on the personal information.</p>
