IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We may use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyze user movement.</p>
        <p><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong><br>
          Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, Anticlown Media may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on any of the Anticlown Media websites.</p>
        <p><strong>Business Transitions</strong><br>
          In the event Anticlown Media goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.</p>
