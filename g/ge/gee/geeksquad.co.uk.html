<p>When you place an order with us, we need to collect certain information to be able to process your order. What we need varies depending on the items you have ordered, and the pages you are asked to complete will vary accordingly. The information is sent to us via an SSL encrypted server. This information will form part of a permanent record of your dealings with us.</p>
<p>When you email us, we may ask for certain information to be able to check this record and answer your questions quickly and accurately. When you contact us, in any way, we may make a note of this contact if it is relevant to your permanent record. This allows us to provide a higher level of ongoing customer care.</p>
<p>We will keep your personal details, given to us by you or others during your relationship with us and other companies in the Carphone Warehouse Group plc group of companies (including our mobile and insurance companies).</p>
<p><strong>These includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>details you give us on application forms or during conversations with you on the telephone or on site,</li>
<li>details you give us so that we can provide you with goods and services,</li>
<li>details we receive from credit reference and fraud detection agencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we may use and update this centrally held information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>for credit and credit related services and to manage your accounts</li>
<li>to provide you with other services</li>
<li>to identify other products and services which might be suitable for you</li>
<li>to recover debts</li>
<li>to prevent and detect fraud</li>
<li>to update our records about you</li>
<li>to prevent money laundering</li>
<li>to check your identity</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You agree that we may use your personal information to make a credit check on you before we provide you with any services. These searches will be recorded by the credit reference agencies. We may disclose information about how you run your accounts to the credit reference agencies. We and other organisations may also use credit reference agency and fraud prevention agency records that we receive about you, people financially linked to you and others in your household to help make decisions about you and them.</p>
<p>We may also use your information for research and statistical analysis with the aim of improving our services.</p>
<p>When assessing an application, we may use automated decision-making systems.</p>
<p>If you request it, on payment of a fee, which is currently £10, we will provide you with a copy of the personal information to which you are entitled that we hold about you.</p>
<p>The information we hold about you is confidential. We will only disclose it outside The Carphone Warehouse Group when:</p>
<ul>
<li>you give us your consent</li>
<li>it is needed by certain reputable third parties involved in running accounts and/or providing services for you (for example, credit reference agencies who do credit checks for us)</li>
<li>in order to obtain professional advice</li>
<li>regulatory or governmental body requests or requires it, even without your consent</li>
<li>there is a duty to the public to reveal the information</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may administer your account and provide other services from centres in countries outside Europe that do not always have the same standard of data protection laws as the UK. However, we will have a contract in place to ensure that your information is adequately protected, and we will remain bound by our obligations under the Data Protection Act even when your personal information is processed outside Europe.</p>
