						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><span class="underline">Information Automatically Collected from You.</span>  In addition to the information you provide to us, use of the Services may result in certain additional information being automatically collected and stored. This information may include:

							<li>Location data collected through your device (including, for example, precise location data such as GPS and WiFi information).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><span class="underline">Information You Publicly Post through the Services.</span>  If you post information on public areas of this website or otherwise publicly post information through or using the Services, that information may be collected and used by Demand Media, other users of the Services, and the public generally.

				<p class="subheading">II.	Collection of Information by Third Parties. </p>
				<ol type="A">
					<li><span class="underline">Advertising and Analytics.</span>
						<p>The Services may be supported through advertising, and we may work with third party advertisers and advertising networks to provide advertising through the Services.  We may provide these third party advertisers and advertising networks with the ability to collect information about how you interact with the Services and your mobile device.  This information may include the unique device or advertising identifier associated with your device and your precise location information, in order to help analyze and serve targeted advertising on the Services and elsewhere (including third-party sites and applications). </p>
						<p>We may also work with analytics companies to help us understand how the Services are being used, such as tracking the frequency and duration of your use of a Service. We may use Google Analytics, an analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), to collect information about your use of the Services and that information allows us to analyze your use of the Services. Google may collect information about the content you view and your system information and geographic information. The information generated by Google about your use of the Services will be transmitted to and stored by Google. </p>
						<p>We encourage you to review your device and Service settings to ensure they are consistent with your preferences, including with respect to the collection and use of information. You may be able to stop further collection of certain information by the Services by updating your applicable device settings, or you may uninstall the Services or stop using the Services. In addition, you may choose not to share your location details by adjusting your mobile device’s location services settings.  For instructions on changing the relevant settings, please contact your service provider or device manufacturer.</p>
					</li>
					<li><span class="underline">Third Party Links and Content.</span>  In addition, the Services may include third-party advertising, links to third party websites, and other content from third-party businesses.  These third-parties may use cookies and web beacons to track the actions of users online over time and across different websites or platforms to deliver targeted electronic advertisements to an individual user.  For information about how tracking works for online advertising purposes you can visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices.   We do not have access to or control over web beacons or cookies that third-party websites may use.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third-party websites.  You are encouraged to review the privacy policies of the different websites you visit. In addition, some third-party advertising companies may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology.  For more information about the opt-out process, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative website, available at: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</li>
					<li><span class="underline">Do Not Track Requests.</span>  If you access the Services through a browser, your browser may allow you to adjust your browser settings so that “do not track” requests are sent to the websites that you visit.  However, we will not disable tracking technology that may be active on the Services in response to any “do not track” requests that we receive from your browser. </li>
					<li><span class="underline">Payment Processors.</span>  If you make a purchase through any of the Services, you may be able to pay using a third party payment service, such as Stripe, PayPal, Apple Pay or other third party payment services.

Information collected from you by these third party payment services is governed by the applicable third party payment service’s privacy policy.

				<p class="subheading">III.	Social Media Services. </p>
				<p>The Services may use social networking or “share functionality” or may contain links to third party social media sites that are not owned or controlled by Demand Media.

Demand Media has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, any share functionality or the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party site. You are subject to the policies of those third parties when and where applicable. We also may allow you to use social media sites to leverage your existing social media site accounts to access features of the Services. Please review your privacy settings for your applicable social media site account, as those settings determine what information may be made available to us when you access the Services through a social media site. </p>
				<p>We encourage you to review the privacy policies and settings on the social media sites with which you interact to make sure you understand the information that may be collected, used, and shared by those sites.</p>

						<li><span class="underline">Response to Subpoenas or Court Orders or to Protect Rights and to Comply with Our Policies.</span> To the extent permitted by law, we will disclose your information to government authorities or third parties if: (i) we are required to do so by law, or if requested in response to a subpoena or court order; (ii) we believe in our sole discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect against fraud or to protect the property or other rights of us or other users, third parties or the public at large; or (iii) we believe that you have abused the Services by using them to attack other systems or to gain unauthorized access to any other system, to engage in spamming or otherwise to violate applicable laws or in violation of our Terms of Use. You should be aware that, following disclosure to any third party, your information may be accessible by others to the extent permitted or required by applicable law.</li>
						<li><span class="underline">Service Providers.</span>  We may share your information with our service providers who work on our behalf. For example, these service providers may handle payment or credit card processing, data management, feature administration, email distribution, market research, information analysis, and promotions management.  These service providers will only have access to the information needed to perform these limited functions on our behalf.</li>
						<li><span class="underline">Business Transfers; Bankruptcy.</span> In the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of our assets, any user information owned or controlled by us, or collected by third parties, including third party payment services, in connection with your use of the Services, may be one of the assets transferred to third parties. We reserve the right, as part of this type of transaction, to transfer or assign your information and other information we have collected from users of the Services to third parties.  Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred user information will be subject to this Privacy Policy. However, any information you submit or that is collected after this type of transfer may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor entity.</li>
