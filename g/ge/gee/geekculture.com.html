                  <p><strong>Who We Are<br>
                  </strong>Geek Culture provides forums, websites, and applications (collectively, âServicesâ). We are based in Canada.</p>
                  <p>Upon request, we will delete your account and de-associate your screen name from posts.&nbsp; If you wish to delete posts, you can do that at any time (go to the post you wish to delete and select âeditâ or âdeleteâ).                  </p>
                  <p><strong>How This Policy Applies</strong></p>
                  <p>This Policy describes the information we collect from you, how we use that information, and our legal basis for doing so. It also covers whether and how that information may be shared and your rights and choices regarding the information you provide to us. By using the Services offered by Geek Culture, youâre acknowledging you have agreed to our Terms of Service and that youâve read and understood this Privacy Policy.</p>
                  <p><strong>The Information We Collect and Receive</strong></p>
                  <p>In order for you to create an account on Geek Culture and use our Services, or to purchase something from us, we need to collect and process certain information. Depending on your use of the Services, that may include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><em>Information you provide by completing forms on Geek Culture</em>: This may contain items like your email address, age, login, and password details. We may ask for this information if you register as a user of the Services, subscribe to our newsletters, or if you contact us.</li>
                    <li><em>Details of any requests or transactions you make through the Services</em>: In other words, if you buy something from us, we may collect your address in order to send you the products. Geek Culture partners with Paypal.com for payment processing, and the payment information you submit is collected and used by them in accordance with their privacy policy (<a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full">click here</a>). Geek Culture does not store your payment information.</li>
                    <li><em>Information about your activity on and interaction with Geek Culture, including use of our mobile apps</em>: Such as your IP address, the type of device or browser you use, may be recorded and used for traffic anayatic purposes.</li>
                    <li><em>Information about the ways people visit and interact with our Services, in the form of traffic analytics</em>: You can opt out of being included in Google Analytics <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>.</li>
                    <li><em>Communications you send to us</em>: For example, when you ask for support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem.</li>
                    <li><em>Your content that you submit on or to Geek Culture in the form of comments, contributions to discussions, or messages to other users</em>: Your content, date and time stamps, and all associated comments may be publicly viewable on Geek Culture, along with your member name. This also may be indexed by search engines and be republished elsewhere on the Internet in accordance with our Terms of Service.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>You may decline to provide us with your information. However, this will limit your ability to register an account or use our Services.</p>
                  <p>You may review, change, or remove your information through your account settings. To delete your account, contact us&nbsp;and we will delete your account.</p>
                  <p>When you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to other users. Please note, however, that the posts, comments, and messages you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others, unless you delete such content. We may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account, but most likely we will not keep a thing, except perhaps the email you sent to ask to delete your account.</p>
                  <p><strong>Retention</strong></p>
                  <p>We will retain your information as long as your account is active, as necessary to provide you with the Services or as otherwise set forth in this Policy. We will also retain and use this information as necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy and to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and protect Geek Cultureâs legal rights.</p>
                  <p><strong>Location Information</strong></p>
                  <p>We may receive and process information about your location. We may receive location information from you when you choose to share such information on our Services, including by associating your content with a location, or we may derive your approximate location from other information about you, including your IP address.</p>
                  <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
                  <p>We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
                  <p><strong>How We Use This Information</strong></p>
                  <p>We do not sell your personal data to third parties to use for their own marketing purposes. We may use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>To enable us to provide you with our Services and to improve and promote our Services.</li>
                    <li>To create and administer your account, contact you, and customize your experience on Geek Culture.</li>
                    <li>To display internet-based advertising to you on Geek Culture, to improve our advertising and measurement systems so we can show you relevant ads, and to measure the effectiveness and reach of ads and Services. </li>
                    <li>To track and analyze use of our Services so that we can improve how Geek Culture is performing and provide users with the best experience possible.</li>
                    <li>To comply with legal obligations, as part of our general business operations, and for other business administration purposes.</li>
                    <li>To keep your account secure and protect our services. Where we believe necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person or violations of our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>European Union Users<br>
                  </strong>Data protection law in Europe requires a âlawful basisâ for collecting and retaining personal information from citizens or residents of the European Economic Area. Our lawful bases include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Legitimate interests: This is a technical term in data protection law which essentially means we have a good and fair reason to use your data and we do so in ways which do not hurt your interest and rights. We sometimes require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and that does not materially impact your rights, freedom, or interests.For example, we use identity, device, and location information to prevent fraud and abuse and keep our services secure. We may also send you promotional communications about our Services, although we rarely do, subject to your right to control whether we do so.We analyze how users interact with our Services so we can understand better what elements of the design are working well and which are working not so well. This allows us to improve and develop the quality of the online experience we offer all our users.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>How This Information Is Shared</strong></p>
                  <p>We share information as set forth below, and where individuals have otherwise consented:</p>
                  <p><strong>Information that is shared publicly</strong></p>
                  <p>When you create a Forum account, we create a basic profile page for you on Geek Culture containing your username and the date the account was created. By default, your profile is private and you can choose to make profile information public in your account settings. Your username appears with the comments you post and messages you send on Geek Culture and, if your profile is set to public, people can click your username to view profile. If you choose to make these profile items public, others may be able to see the following things if you include them...</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Your online status</li>
