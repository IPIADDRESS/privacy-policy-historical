    Privacy Policy for GeekWire.com and GeekWork.com  </h1>
</div>
  <p>Last updated Jan. 26, 2014.</p>
<p>GeekWire, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“<b>GeekWire</b>”, “<b>we</b>” “<b>us</b>” or “<b>our</b>”) recognizes that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy (this “<b>Policy</b>”)<b>&nbsp;</b>sets forth the information collection and security procedures applicable to GeekWire.com and GeekWork.com (collectively, the “<b>Website</b>”), as well as all related applications, widgets, software, tools, and other services provided by us and on which a link to this Policy is displayed (collectively, together with the Website, our “<b>Services</b>”), and describes GeekWire’s collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information (defined below) in connection with providing the Services. This Policy is incorporated by reference into the GeekWire.com and GeekWork.com <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/termsofuse/">Terms of Use</a>, (hereafter referred to as the “<b>Terms of Use</b>”) and is subject to the provisions of the Terms of Use.</p>
<p><b>Please review this document to understand:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>What GeekWire considers Personal Information.</li>
<li>What Personal Information we collect.</li>
<li>How we use and disclose your Personal Information.</li>
<li>How you can access and change your account information.</li>
<li>What security procedures are in place to protect the information.</li>
<li>How to contact us if there are any problems or concerns.</li>
<li>How we can update this Policy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon registering for or using the Services, you explicitly acknowledge and assent to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, do not use the Services. It is GeekWire’s policy to comply with data protection legislation, which grants you certain rights related to your Personal Information.</p>
<p>The Services may contain links to other web sites, products, or services that we do not own or operate (collectively, “<b>Third Party Sites</b>”). The Services also may contain links to Third Party Sites such as social networking services.&nbsp; This Policy applies to information collected on or through the Services and not Third Party Sites referenced from our Services. We cannot control and are not responsible for the information use practices of Third Party Sites or others who may access your information on or through the Services. When you click on links to Third Party Sites, we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Their standards may differ from ours. Additionally, please be aware that the Services may contain links to web sites and services that we operate but that are governed by different privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies applicable to any web site or service you visit other than the Services.</p>
<p><b>What is Personal Information?</b></p>
<p>“<b>Personal Information</b>” as used in this Policy, is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, resume or credit card information.&nbsp; Personal Information also includes information about an individual’s activities, such as information about his or her activity on our Services, and demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area, and preferences, when any of this information is linked to Personal Information that identifies that individual.</p>
<p>Personal Information does not include “aggregate” or other non-personally identifiable information.&nbsp; Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed.&nbsp; We may use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personally identifiable information, for various purposes.</p>
<p><b>What information do we collect?</b></p>
<p>We try to collect only what we believe is reasonably necessary to help you get the most out of the Services and to connect with the community. We collect Personal Information that our users provide to us in a variety of ways on our Services. These include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Registered Users, Accounts and Profiles:</i>&nbsp;If you create an account to take advantage of all that the Services have to offer, we record Personal Information that you include in your user profile or account settings page. This includes, but is not limited to, your username, password, first and last name, email, street address, phone number, resume information, work opportunities, and related demographic information about you. Profiles may include user-submitted information such as resume data, self-assessed skills ratings, contact information, and portfolio submissions. We may indicate that some Personal Information is required for you to register for the account or to create the profile, while some is optional. If you complete a financial transaction on or through the Services, your payment information will be recorded securely by one or more of our third party e-commerce vendors, such as EventBrite or Shopify.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>E</i>-<i>mail Newsletters:</i>&nbsp;We offer e-mail newsletters on our Services. If you sign up to receive a newsletter from us, we collect your e-mail address.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Listings:&nbsp;</i>We may offer you the opportunity to join various promotional lists or publications including, for instance, our “Geek of the Week” series or our database of start-ups (collectively, the “<b>Listings</b>”).

However, please be aware that you may not be able to access the Services or certain portions of the Services unless cookies are enabled. Also, please be aware that Third Party Sites linked to from the Services may set cookies on your hard drive or use other Web Beacons to passively collect information about your use of their services, Third Party Sites or content.&nbsp; We do not have access to, or control over, these third party means of passive data collection.</li>

<ul>
<li><i>International:&nbsp;</i>Our servers and data centers are located in the United States.

You should know that each region can have its own privacy and data security laws, some of which may be less stringent as compared to those of your own region.
