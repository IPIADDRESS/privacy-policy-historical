<p>California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b)(as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how Geek &amp; Sundry responds to “Do Not Track” browser settings. Geek &amp; Sundry does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.</p>

We may collect Personally Identifiable Information in connection with various functionality and services offered via the Website, including the following:</p>

<li>Metadata. Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted. Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other’s APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if you make your photo public by posting it on our Website.</li>
