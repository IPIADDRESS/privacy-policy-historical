		The cookie expires and is deleted from your computer automatically when you quit your web browser.
		</li><li><u>Discussion List Login</u>:
		When you log into any of our discussion lists, or add-on story programs, a cookie is sent which contains the user name you selected and a randomly generated number.
		This is used to ensure that the proper person is credited for each post.
		The email address you used to register is <b>not</b> shown to anyone.
		You may participate anonymously in any of these forums, in which case no cookies are sent.
		</li><li><u>Shopping Cart</u>:
		Our shopping cart system sends a cookie containing only a random string of characters which is used to identify which shopping cart it yours.
		It contains no personal information whatsoever, and expires and is deleted from your computer automatically when you quit your web browser.
