        <li>
          <p>If you choose to make an application or send us an e-mail for which 
            you provide us with personally identifiable data, we may share necessary

            will NOT share your personal data with non-Government entities, except

          <p>For your convenience, we may also display to you data you had previously 
            supplied us or other Government agencies. This will speed up the transaction 
            and save you the trouble of repeating previous submissions. Should the 
            data be out-of-date, please supply us the latest data. We will retain 
            your personal data only as necessary for the effective delivery of public 
          services to you. </p>
