<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt">2. Web Site Use Information<br>
<br>
Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a

"What Are Cookies?") and web server log files to collect
information about how our Web site is used. Information
gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the
date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our

<br></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt"><strong><u>What Are
Cookies?<br></u></strong><br>
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an
anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that
site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this
file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for
cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser
if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your
privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the
cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you
by other sites.<br>
<br>
 Browsers are usually set to accept cookies.<br>
<br>
 However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may
alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If
you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible
that some areas of our site will not function as effectively
when viewed by the users.<br>
<br></span> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt">A cookie cannot
retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on
computer viruses.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt"><strong><u>How Do We Use
Information We Collect from Cookies?</u></strong><br>
<br>
As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to
differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use
cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is
necessary for security.<br>
<br>
Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow
us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web
site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps
us gather feedback to constantly improve our Web site and
better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any
personal information about you and we do not intentionally
store any personal information that your browser provided to us
in your cookies.<br>
<br>
Some&nbsp;advertisers however, may use the cookie technology
when they advertise<br>
on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as
Google through their Google AdSense program) some information
including your IP address, your ISP, and the browser used when
you visit our site.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt">Google, as a third party
vendor, used cookies to serve ads on our sites. This process is

Google used&nbsp;DART cookies to enable it to serve ads to its
users, based on their interests (”interest based

<strong><u>What is DoubleClick DART cookies?</u></strong><br>

DART cookies are used for ad serving through Google’s

&nbsp;<br>
This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your
interests (”interest based targeting”) and the ads served will
be targeted based on your previous browsing history.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt">DART uses “non personally
identifiable information”.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your
name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social
security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card
numbers.<br>
<br></span> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt">You can opt-out of
this ad serving on all sites using this advertising, by
visiting <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx" target="_new">DART Ad-Serving and Search Cookie
   Opt-Out</a>.<br>

to be warned before a cookie is deposited on your
computer.</span></p>

IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are
connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is

believe that disclosing this information is necessary to

our users and the Public.</span></p>
