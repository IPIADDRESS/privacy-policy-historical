<li>Right to data portability: In certain circumstances, youmay request that we provide your Personal Data to you in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and have it transferred to another provider of the same or similar services. We will comply with such transfer as far as it is technically feasible. Please note that a transfer to another provider does not imply erasure of your Personal Data which may still be required for legitimate and lawful purposes.</li>
<li>Your right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority: We suggest that you contact us about any questions or if you have a complaint in relation to how we process your Personal Data. However, individuals who are in the EEA have the right to contact our lead supervisory authority in Europe  which is currently the Information Commissioner's Office in the United Kingdom.
