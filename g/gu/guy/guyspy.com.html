<h2>GuySpy Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><strong>LAST MODIFIED: August 25, 2010</strong></p>
<p>XIP Services Inc. ("GuySpy" or "we") operates GuySpy.com. We take your privacy seriously, and have created this Privacy Policy to inform you about our privacy practices. We encourage you to read the following information carefully and contact us with any questions you may have.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes GuySpy’s use and sharing of  information provided by Users. The Term "User" refers to a visitor or  a member.</p>
<p>The GuySpy Website is a general audience site and does  not knowingly collect personally identifiable information ("PII") such as  names, address, phone number or email addresses, from individual who are less  than 18 years of age.</p>
<p>From time to time, GuySpy may modify this Privacy Policy  to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and  use practices, and/or the features of the GuySpy Services or technology, and  such modifications shall be effective upon posting by GuySpy on the GuySpy Website.  Your continued use of the GuySpy Services after GuySpy posts a revised Privacy  Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. It is therefore  important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are  updated as to any changes. If GuySpy materially changes its practices regarding  collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the  Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of,  and have not objected to, the change. </p>
<p><strong>What This Privacy Policy Covers</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by GuySpy,  including any GuySpy branded URL (the "GuySpy &nbsp;Website"), the GuySpy instant messaging  service, the GuySpy &nbsp;Smartphone applications,  and other features, GuySpy &nbsp;mobile  services, and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to  time by GuySpy &nbsp;in connection with the GuySpy  Website (collectively, the "GuySpy &nbsp;Services"). This Privacy Policy applies only to the practices of companies we own or control, and people we  employ or manage. </p>
<p><strong>What Types of Information Are Collected and Used?</strong></p>
<p>The GuySpy Services collects two  kinds of information: personally identifiable information (“PII”), and  non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”). For the  purposes of this Privacy Policy, PII refers to data that can be used to identify  you specifically, such as your name, home address or email address and can  include information you provide to us on registration (also known as  "Registration PII"). Non-PII refers to data  which does not allow  you to be identified specifically, such as your IP address, usage preferences, or  browser type. </p>
<p>In addition to the PII collected by GuySpy, GuySpy members  may also choose to provide or store additional PII information in their public  or semi-public profiles, including, but not limited to, date of birth,  interests, hobbies, lifestyles, groups or communities with whom you associate  (schools, companies, politics), videos and/or pictures, private messages,  bulletins or personal statements (collectively "Profile Information").  Profile Information is provided voluntarily at a User’s sole discretion and is  generally outside of this policy. GuySpy members can change their Registration  PII and Profile Information at any time and can control how visitors, other members,  and GuySpy communicate with them by controlling their account settings,  available within the "Edit Profile" portion of their GuySpy profile.</p>
<p>Non-PII could include your IP address, browser type, and cookies,  as well as statistical and aggregated data on how GuySpy is being used. This  data is used to manage and improve the GuySpy Services, track usage, and for  security purposes. Cookies are small bits of information that GuySpy places on  your computer. GuySpy uses cookies to identify your Internet browser, store  Users' preferences, and determine whether you have installed the enabling  software needed to access certain material on the GuySpy Services. Data in  cookies may be read to authenticate user sessions or provide services. </p>
<p><strong>Why We Collect PII</strong></p>
<p>We may collect PII, such as your  name, home and/or billing address, email address, date of birth, and payment  information, when you register as a Member, use the GuySpy Services,  participate in our contests, promotions, or surveys, or through e-commerce. If  PII is requested during a specific activity, you may be denied the opportunity  to participate without disclosing the requested PII. The PII is collected for  the purposes and uses contained in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p><strong>How We Use PII</strong></p>
<p>PII may be used for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>To establish and maintain a responsible commercial       relationship with you, and to provide ongoing service.</strong> For example, when you register as a member to use       the GuySpy Services, we collect information allowing us to confirm your       identity, and accurately bill and collect for the GuySpy Services you       receive. We may also collect credit card or bank account information,       based on your preferred method of payment for the GuySpy Services. Profile       Information you provide in structured profile fields or questions       ("Structured Profile Information"), information you add to       open-ended profile fields and questions ("Non-Structured Profile       Information") and other voluntarily provided PII may also be used to       customize the online ads you encounter to those we believe are aligned       with your interests. For example, based on your music interests we might       display an advertisement to make sure you are advised when your favorite       band is coming to town. </li>
  <li><strong>To market our services.</strong> With your consent, we may use your telephone number,       email address, and/or mailing address to send you information regarding       special offers, contests, affiliated products and/or services, and other       initiatives we think may be of interest to you (“Marketing       Communications”). You can opt out from receiving Marketing Communications       at any time by using the methods outlined below. Without your consent, we       may also send you important communications related to your membership       account such as service announcements and administrative messages       (“Membership Communications”). Membership Communications are a feature of       your account and allowing delivery may be a condition of using the GuySpy       Services.</li>
  <li><strong>To meet legal and regulatory requirements.</strong> For example, we may use information to respond to a       subpoena, court order, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our       legal rights or defend against legal claims. </li>
  <li><strong>To allow Users to get the most out of the GuySpy Services.</strong> In order to       locate other GuySpy Members that you may already know in the physical world. GuySpy also allows Users to browse for certain Profile Information in order to help connect with Members (i.e. schools and/or companies where Users may have attended or worked). GuySpy may also enable Members to publicly display some Registration PII as an element of their Profile Information if they choose to do so via a profile setting under "Edit Profile." Search engines may index the portion of a Member's profile(including the Profile Information it contains) that is publicly displayed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How We Use Non-PII</strong><br>
  From time  to time, we may ask you to provide us with non-PII which does not allow us to  identify you specifically, such as IP address, zip code, GuySpy Services usage  preferences, and demographic data such as income bracket, age, or gender. Your  non-PII may be aggregated and used internally, or may be shared with third  parties for any lawful purpose, without your permission. Third parties will not  be able to use this information to identify you in any way.<br>
  Some of the ways in which we may use your non-PII include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>To manage and develop the  GuySpy Services.</strong> We track and analyze  customer usage of the GuySpy Services and its supporting facilities in the  aggregate to help us maximize efficiency, plan for future growth, and identify  features for enhancing your overall user experience.</li>
  <li><strong>To manage and develop our website.</strong> We track and analyze customer usage of the GuySpy Services in the aggregate to maintain  our website and/or identify problems on our servers. </li>
  <li><strong>Cookies.</strong> GuySpy may use cookies and similar tools to  customize the content and advertising you receive based on the Profile  Information you have provided. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When Do We Disclose Your  Information?</strong></p>
<p>We will not sell or rent your  personal information to anyone. We may disclose personal information about you  to third parties only when:</p>
<ul>
  <li>we have your consent to disclose the information; </li>
  <li>we need to disclose the information to affiliates or companies who work on our behalf to provide you with the GuySpy Services (these companies do not have any right to use your personal information beyond what is necessary to assist us); </li>
  <li>we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; or </li>
  <li>we find that your actions on the Website or the GuySpy Services violate the <a href="/gay_dating/terms_of_use" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>Any such disclosure of your personal  information is made on a confidential basis with the information to be used  only for the purpose for which it was disclosed.<br>
  GuySpy Services may be linked to Internet sites operated  by other companies. GuySpy Services may also carry advertisements from other  companies. GuySpy is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites or  other services operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with  the GuySpy Services or for the privacy practices of third party Internet  advertising companies. Once you leave GuySpy Services via such a link, access a  third party application (such as widgets), or click on an advertisement, you  should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser  site to determine, among other things, how they will handle any PII they  collect from you.</p>
