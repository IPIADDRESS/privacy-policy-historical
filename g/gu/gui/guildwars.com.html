</p>
<p>
  <em>Personal Information</em>. "Personal Information" is information that
  would allow someone to identify or contact you, including, for example,
  your name, address, telephone number, or email address. Personal
  Information does not include aggregated information that, by itself, does
  not permit the identification of individual persons (such as statistics
  about how many persons visited our Site last month, or how many visitors
  are male and how many are female).
</p>
<p>
  <em>Acceptance</em>. This Privacy Policy is a part of our <a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/website-terms-of-use/">Website Terms
  of Use</a> and by using the Sites, you agree to be bound by their terms
  and conditions. This Privacy Policy only addresses activities from our
  servers. Other sites (including those to which we may link) and other
  service providers may have their own policies, which we do not control,
  and thus are not addressed or controlled by this Privacy Policy. <a name="1"></a>
</p>
<h3>
  <a name="1">(1) Collection of Personal Information</a>
</h3>
<p>
  You provide certain Personal Information to us when you: (a) register to
  use the services, (b) register for contests or giveaways, (c) complete
  questionnaires, (d) order products and services from us, (e) send email
  messages, submit forms, or send other information to us, or (f) when you
  use our service and the communication tools.
</p>
<h4>
  Logging of Chats or Messaging Features
</h4>
<p>
  Please note that NCsoft will store all communication exchanged between
  you and any other person while using any game served by NCsoft. This not
  only includes “public” chats but also includes all messages exchanged in
  private chats; “party,” “guild,” or “alliance” chats; as well as all
  messages sent using the mail system in our game (herein collectively
  referred to as “Communication Data”).
</p>
<p>
  Please note that ArenaNet and NCsoft Interactive are not based within the
  European Union and have their place of business in the United States of
  America and that by agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are consenting
  to the transfer of your Personal Information to the United States of
  America – please also refer to section 8 of this Privacy Policy. ArenaNet
  and NCsoft Interactive have also entered into a data processing agreement
  with NCsoft Europe which ensures adequate safeguards for your Personal
  Information when it is transferred outside of the European Economic Area.
</p>
<p>
  The Communication Data will be stored by NCsoft on its own servers which
  are maintained only by internal IT staff of NCsoft. Staff members have
  been advised not to access the Communication Data unless expressly
  requested by NCsoft’s executive management.
</p>
<p>
  Customer Support, including 3rd party support contractors, and a subset
  of software development staff may access the Communication Data but only
  from within the local area network of NCsoft or via a secure, encrypted
  tunnel from an approved site. Every access to the Communication Data is
  logged and such log files are controlled on a regular basis for
  compliance with the rules of the data processing agreement. Any outside
  access is restricted by technical measures. Physical access to the
  servers is restricted by physical access controls and identification
  requirements. Customer Support staff of NCsoft have been instructed to
  access the Communication Data only upon the receipt of a Customer Support
  request relating to that specific set of Communication Data. Software
  development staff of NCsoft have been instructed to access the
  Communication Data only when necessary to perform development and
  debugging tasks related to the collection, querying, and parsing of
  Communication Data for Customer Support related tools. Customer Support
  and software development staff are instructed not to access Communication
  Data under any other circumstances. Communication Data is not transferred
  to any third party under any circumstances unless such disclosure is
  legally required by law enforcement authorities or by a court order of a
  US court or a court of a member state of the European Union.
</p>
<p>
  The Communication Data is stored as long as it is required to provide
  customer support. Unless any Communication Data is used to aid a
  customer’s support request, or is used to investigate a breach of the
  User Agreement (or any other agreement) between you and NCsoft or is the
  subject of a request from law enforcement authorities, all Communication
  Data is deleted after two months. Mail sent to other players outside of
  the control of NCsoft may be stored longer depending on the time the
  recipient deletes the mail from his inbox.
</p>
<p>
  Should you have any questions in relation to the logging of chats or
  messaging features you may contact either NCsoft Europe or ArenaNet at
  <a href="mailto:Privacy@Arena.Net">Privacy@Arena.Net</a>
</p>
<h4>
  Use of Email Address
</h4>
<p>
  Your email address will be used to contact you regarding specific issues
  related to your active account(s). You may also receive special notices
  and offers for products and services offered by NCsoft. You will be given
  the opportunity to "opt out" of any mailings that do not include critical
  information regarding your active game account(s).
</p>
<p>
  Please see "Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions, and Related Third-Party
  Services" below for specific information on how your Personal Information
  may be used by third parties in those special cases.
</p>
<h4>
  Payment Method
</h4>
<p>
  You will also be asked to submit Personal Information depending on the
  payment method you choose when accessing, purchasing or subscribing to
  one of our products or services. For example, if you choose to pay for
  NCsoft products or services by credit card, you will be required to
  provide us the name of your credit card issuer, credit card number,
  billing address, CVV number, and expiration date.
</p>
<p>
  If you choose to pay for NCsoft products or services and/or the services
  NCsoft performs on behalf of its affiliates by using, without limitation,
  cheque, PayPal, SMS, paysafecard, Gem cards, Game Time Cards, or ELV, you
  will be required to provide us with applicable Personal Information in
  order to permit us to process such payment.
</p>
<h4>
  Non-personal Information
</h4>
<p>
  In addition to the login information, we will automatically collect
  certain non-personal information about your use of our Sites and
  services. We might collect, among other things, information concerning
  the type of Internet browser, computer, or computer operating system you
  are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your "click
  path" through the Sites, and the web site or advertisement that was
  linked to or from the Sites when you visited. To do this, we may use
  cookies and other technology (see below).
</p>
<p>
  Your visits to our Sites, and information provided through these
  technologies, will be anonymous unless you provide us with Personal
  Information or have provided such information in the past. For example,
  if you've created a membership account, your account information
  (including name, email address, and billing and shipping information) may
  be linked to the items you purchased at our online store (i.e., purchase
  order history).
</p>
<p>
  This information is only used for our internal purposes (such as to
  improve the Site or to customize content).
</p>
<h4>
  Cookies and Related Technologies
</h4>
<p>
  We use a feature of your browser called a "cookie" to assign a unique
  number that automatically identifies your computer when you visit our
  Site. A cookie is a piece of text-only data stored on your hard drive. By
  setting a cookie on our Site, you would not have to log in a password
  more than once, thereby saving time while on our Site.
</p>
<p>
  If you reject the cookie, you may still use our Site. The only drawback
  to this is that you may be limited in some areas of our Site, or may have
  to enter passwords or identifying information more than once.
</p>
<h4>
  Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions, and Related Third Party Services
</h4>
<p>
  To participate in some of our sweepstakes, contests, surveys, or other
  promotions, you may be asked to provide additional Personal Information
  such as your mailing address. In each such case, no new Personal
  Information will be collected from you without your consent. This
  information may be collected by NCsoft or by third parties such as
  co-sponsors or vendors for the promotion.
</p>
<p>
  Our use of any such information will be governed by this Privacy Policy.
  The names of third parties such as co-sponsors (other than vendors hired
  by NCsoft to conduct, administer, and execute a promotion on behalf of
  NCsoft) will be disclosed to you when you are asked to sign up for the
  promotion. You should review such third parties' privacy policies to see
  how they may use any information that they collect.
</p>
<p>
  Certain NCsoft services, sweepstakes, and/or contests, may be provided to
  you in conjunction with a third party. During the registration process
  for any such sweepstakes, contests, surveys, and other promotions or
  service(s) related to such games, you may be notified that such third
  party wishes to access some of your Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
  In such a situation, you will be given an opportunity to decline to share
  that information with that third party before any such information is
  shared. If you decline to share such information with the relevant third
  party, you may not be able to participate in such sweepstakes, contests,
  surveys, and other promotions or service(s) for that game.
</p>
<p>
  As described in the registration process, a third party's use of the
  shared Personal Information will be governed by any privacy policy that
  company may have in place and our use of such information shall, of
  course, be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h4>
  Online Communications, Games
</h4>
<p>
  When you play any of the games offered and/or served by NCsoft, or use
  any of the communication features on the Sites, your IP address (the
  Internet protocol address from which you access any of the above) may be
  stored in our records.
</p>
<p>
  When any game is updated or "patched," our patch routine may check your
  computer to see that you have the most recent version of game-specific
  files; when you communicate within any game or any other communication
  feature within any of our Sites (e.g. live chat, instant message
  services, and the like), even "privately" to another person, you do so
  with the understanding that those communications go through our servers,
  can be monitored by us, you have no expectation of privacy in any of
  those communications and, accordingly, you expressly consent to
  monitoring of communications (including technical support and customer
  service communications) that you send and receive.
</p>
<p>
  When you log into one of our online games, your system
  specifications—such as OS, RAM, video card, monitor, system
  configuration, etc.—may be reviewed/recorded by us for the purposes of
  analyzing and optimizing your game experience and in order to provide you
  with customer service. <a name="2"></a>
</p>
<h3>
  <a name="2">(2) Who Collects the Personal Information</a>
</h3>
<p>
  NCsoft Europe is the company that collects Personal Information on our
  Site. Personal Information is then processed on behalf of NCsoft Europe
  by (and is therefore transferred to) ArenaNet and NCsoft Interactive. Our
  mailing address is 5th Floor, Mocatta House, Trafalgar Place, Brighton
  BN1 4DU, UK. Our customer service email address is <a href="mailto:Privacy@Arena.Net">Privacy@Arena.Net</a>. <a name="3"></a>
</p>
<h3>
  <a name="3">(3) How the Personal Information Is Used</a>
</h3>
<p>
  Personal Information which we collect for a particular purpose will only
  be saved and used for that purpose, unless you have agreed to allow us to
  use it for some other purpose, as described in this Privacy Policy. In
  relation to our use of Communication Data please see above for a more
  detailed overview.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if you make an online purchase from our online store, and
  unless you have given us permission to do otherwise, we will only collect
  and save the Personal Information you provided to us, including your
  billing and delivery information, in order to:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Complete the sale&gt;
  </li>
  <li>Comply with tax and other applicable statutes&gt;
  </li>
  <li>Maintain accurate business and financial records (in accordance with
  accepted standards)&gt;
  </li>
  <li>Assist with customer service and returns&gt;
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  When you have provided Personal Information to us for a particular
  purpose, we may disclose your information to other companies that we have
  engaged to assist us in fulfilling your request. This may include, but is
  not limited to, fulfillment houses, billing services, transaction
  managers, credit verification services, and other third-party service
  providers.
</p>
<p>
  We may also disclose any of your Personal Information to law enforcement
  or other appropriate third parties in connection with criminal
  investigations, investigation of fraud, infringement of intellectual
  property rights, or other suspected illegal activities, or as otherwise
  may be required by applicable law, or, as we deem necessary in our sole
  discretion, in order to protect the legitimate legal and business
  interests of NCsoft.
</p>
<p>
  We may use the information we collect from you for the purpose of
  providing you with technical support, customer service, and account
  maintenance. We use the information we collect to learn what you like,
  tailor your experience accordingly, and to improve web sites and our
  other products. We send e-mail to our members who want to receive e-mail
  from us.
</p>
<p>
  However, if you don't want to receive e-mail from us, you can "opt out"
  of receiving it at the time you register as a member on our Sites or each
  time we request information from you. If you change your mind and wish to
  stop receiving e-mails from us, you may also choose to opt out by
  following the steps described in each such e-mail.
</p>
<p>
  Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not give any of your
  Personal Information to any third party without your express approval,
  and the only Personal Information we will ask you if you want us to share
  with third parties is your name, your mailing address, and your e-mail
  address.
</p>
<p>
  If you don't want us to share your name, mailing address, and e-mail
  address, you can tell us that by clicking on "No" in the box at the time
  you register as a member on the Site or each time we request information
  from you or at other points. We sometimes share general, demographic, or
  aggregated (not personal) information with third parties about our user
  base, but that information does not include any Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
  You will be deemed to have consented to the disclosure to, and use by, a
  subsequent owner or operator of the Sites, of any Personal Information
  contained in the NCsoft database for such Site(s), if NCsoft or one of
  its companies assigns all of its rights and obligations regarding the use
  of your Personal Information at the time of a bankruptcy, merger,
  acquisition, sale of all or substantially all of NCsoft 's game(s) or
  other assets to a subsequent owner or operator, or similar event.
</p>
<p>
  Please do not use your real name or the real name of another person when
  selecting a user name. Please note that your user name will be available
  to the Internet's general public while you participate in some services,
  like forums, chat rooms, or message boards, so you should exercise
  discretion when using these services. Personal Information disclosed by
  you within our chat areas, instant message service, message boards, or
  during game play can be collected by other users of such services and may
  result in unsolicited messages.
</p>
<p>
  We are not responsible for protecting such information that you may
  disclose to third parties through our services (e.g. sending your address
  to another user through the chat service). To the extent that you create
  a public profile that may be available to others on our Sites and
  services, you solely are responsible for its content and accuracy at all
  times. To edit, change, or delete such information, follow the
  instructions on the Site. <a name="4"></a>
</p>
<h3>
  <a name="4">(4) Privacy Protections for Children</a>
</h3>
<p>
  In order to protect the privacy interests of younger Internet users, we
  do not allow children under the age of 18 to use our services without the
  consent of their parents. NCsoft complies with the Children's Online
  Privacy Protection Act and all other applicable laws and regulations
  concerning children and the Internet.
</p>
<h4>
  Children under the age of 13
</h4>
<p>
  Because our Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13,
  NCsoft does not provide memberships to persons under age 13. If you are
  under the age of 13, you may not create an account on the Site, you may
  not sign up for any subscription service or buy anything through our
  online store, and you are not eligible to enter any of our sweepstakes or
  promotions.
</p>
<p>
  Except as may be required by law, NCsoft will not knowingly collect,
  maintain, or disclose any Personal Information from children under the
  age of 13.
</p>
<h4>
  Children between the ages of 13 and 18
</h4>
<p>
  If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, please let your parent or
  guardian know about this Privacy Policy and get his or her permission
  before you give us any of your personal identifiable information, before
  you use any of our message board, instant message, or chat features,
  before you sign up for any subscription game services, and before you buy
  anything from our online store.

<p>
  Don't post your real name on a web site, forum, or message board, and
  never tell anyone online anything private about yourself or your family,
  including your phone number and/or address. Use screen names and not real
  names at all times.

  If you win a sweepstakes that has a prize, your parent or guardian will
  have to mail or fax us a signed note at the address or fax number listed
  in the rules for the specific contest that says it was OK for you to
  enter, and tells us they will accept the prize for you. Some areas of the
  Site may have special rules for children under the age of 18. When you
  are in those areas, you must follow those rules.

<h4>
  Information for Parents/Guardians
</h4>
<p>
  If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child has
  submitted his or her Personal Information without your permission or
  consent, NCsoft will take reasonable steps to remove that information
  from the NCsoft database at your request.
</p>
<p>
  To request removal of your child's information, please send us an e-mail
  (to the address below) and be sure to include in your message the same
  user name, password, and email address that your child submitted. If your
  child has used your credit card on our Sites without your permission,
  contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:Privacy@Arena.Net">Privacy@Arena.Net</a> <a name="5"></a>

<h3>
  <a name="5">(5) The Choices Available to Users Regarding Collection, Use,
  and Distribution of Personal Information</a>
</h3>
<p>
  Please note that if you provide any information on your own or directly
  to parties who provide service to our Site or any other sites you
  encounter on the Internet (even if these sites are branded with our
  branding), different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the
  Personal Information you disclose to them. We encourage you to
  investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to third
  parties. <a name="6"></a>
</p>
<h3>
  <a name="6">(6) How users can correct any inaccuracies in their Personal
  Information</a>
</h3>
<p>
  To review and update your Personal Information stored with NCsoft, please
  access your applicable account. If you change your mind and do not want
  to receive e-mails from us and/or have us share your name and e-mail
  address (or other Personal Information) with third parties, you may send
  an e-mail to us at <a href="mailto:Privacy@Arena.Net">Privacy@Arena.Net</a>
</p>
<p>
  If you choose to have your Personal Information removed from our active
  databases, we will do so within a reasonable time after receipt of your
  request and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your Personal
  Information is not used (except as may be required by law) by NCsoft
  after your notification to us. <a name="7"></a>
</p>
<h3>
  <a name="7">(7) The Security Procedures We Use to Protect the Loss,
  Misuse, or Alteration of Your Personal Information Under Our Control</a>
</h3>
<p>
  NCsoft takes precautions to protect our users' information. When users
  submit sensitive information via our Site, that information is protected
  both online and off-line.
</p>
<p>
  We have established and maintain reasonable security procedures to
  protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of your Personal
  Information. We use encryption, Secure Socket Layers, and other technical
  measures (such as off-site backup, security testing, and password
  protection), and we implement off-line efforts to further protect this
  information, including limiting employee access to Personal Information
  and updating our employees regarding our security practices and privacy
  policies. Please recognize, however, that "perfect security" does not
  exist on the Internet.
</p>
<p>
  If you have any questions about the security at our website or
  facilities, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@arena.net">privacy@arena.net</a>. <a name="8"></a>

  By consenting to this Privacy Policy, you confirm that your command and
  knowledge of English (or in some cases, French, German, or Spanish) is
  sufficient to understand the terms and conditions set forth herein.
</p>
<p>
  We will not collect any Personal Information from you unless you provide
  it voluntarily by providing us with your freely given specific and
  informed consent. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you agree that we
  may transfer your Personal Information to NCsoft group companies outside
  the European Economic Area (to the United States of America and/or Korea)
  in connection with the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. <a name="9"></a>

<h3>
  <a name="9">(9) Notices of changes to the Privacy Policy</a>
</h3>
<p>
  NCsoft reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by
  notifying registered users via e-mail of the existence of a new Privacy
  Policy and/or posting the new Privacy Policy on the NCsoft Sites. All
  changes to the Privacy Policy will be effective when posted, and your

  will constitute your acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, those
  changes.
