<p align="CENTER"><b class="header">PRIVACY POLICY</b></p><br><br><br>
<p>Last Updated: Oct 3, 2005</p>
<p>guitarcontrol.com strives to offer its visitors the many
advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and
personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable
Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone
number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never
sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third
party. Period."</p>
<p><b>How we gather information from users</b></p>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are
visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the
services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide
information when you register for access to certain portions of our
site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you
make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in
sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other
interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, guitarcontrol.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For
example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use
cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your
visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and
password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each
time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a
particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt
additional technology, we may also gather information through other
means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with
information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept
cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions
of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password,
and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features
according to your preferences.</p>
<p><b>Optout policy</b></p>
Users who optin to our mailing list (subscribers) may optout simply by clicking on the link
at the bottom of any message they receive, which indicates:  Unsubscribe by
clicking on this link.  Subscribers may also optout by contacting us at www.GuitarControlHelp.com
and creating a ticket with their email address used for subscription, and their contact information
will be removed from our databases within 7 days.
<p><b>What we do with the information we collect</b></p>
<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your
visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We
respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally
identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine
information about your usage patterns with similar information
obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services
(e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are
most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared
with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information
does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or
allow anyone to identify you individually.</p>
<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
guitarcontrol.com to communicate with you about your registration and
customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy;
services and products offered by guitarcontrol.com and other topics
we think you might find of interest. 
</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by guitarcontrol.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner
with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user
information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose
your information in response to a court order, at other times when we
believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection
with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law
enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary.
Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in
such cases.</p>
<p><b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b></p>
<p>guitarcontrol.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own
privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example,
during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a
frame on a guitarcontrol.com page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through guitarcontrol.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. guitarcontrol.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>
<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other
third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to
identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you.
For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and
may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether
you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features
available on our site may offer services operated by third parties
and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.
guitarcontrol.com does not control the use of this technology by
third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible
for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose
Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat
areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected
and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in
unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such
activities are beyond the control of guitarcontrol.com and this
policy.</p>
