Guitar Center knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared. Our goals are to inspire the confidence of the users of our Web sites. This privacy policy discloses how we collect, use and share information gathered about you on our network of Web sites.<br><br>

This privacy policy is the same for all of the sites in Guitar Center's network of Web sites, unless indicated otherwise by the presence of a separate privacy policy on a given site. We hope that this disclosure will help increase your confidence in our sites and enhance your experience on the Internet.

<a name="infotypes"></a>
<h4>What types of information are Guitar Center sites collecting, and how are the sites collecting it?</h4>

Many of the services and products on our sites are available for viewing without our collecting any personally identifiable information from you. You can surf Guitar Center's Web sites and see much of our terrific content anonymously. For instance, you can get store information, read artist interviews and learn about clinics at guitarcenter.com, or view the content on Guitar Center's RockWalk, without giving out any personally identifiable information.<br><br>

<b class="px11">Information You Provide</b><br>
There are some activities on our sites where the collection of personally identifiable information is necessary. Those activities include things like entering a contest or sweepstakes, signing up for the Buyer's Guide online, requesting product information at vintageguitars.net, or otherwise contacting us. When personally identifiable information is collected, you will know because you will have to fill out a form. Personally identifiable information may include contact data, such as your name, address, phone and e-mail address; financial data, such as your account or credit card number; and demographic data, such as your zip code, age and income.<br><br>

<b class="px11">Information Collected from You with Technology</b><br>
Guitar Center sites collect some information about you using technology, so it may not be obvious to you that it is being collected. That information may include your IP address, your domain server, your type of computer, your type of web browser, and statistical information regarding the pages that you visit. Guitar Center sites use information collected through technology to make our sites more interesting and useful to you. For example, statistical information can help us track which areas of a site are more popular, so that we can better customize content to the interests of our visitors. We will combine information collected using technology with personally identifiable information only to identify a visitor in order to protect our service, site, Guests or others, when required by law, or when needed to help resolve a technical issue a Guest may be having while viewing the site.<br><br>

<b class="px11">What Are Cookies, and How Does Guitar Center Use Them?</b><br>
Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web site. These pieces of information allow the Web site to remember important information that will make your use of that site more useful. Guitar Center and other Internet companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For instance, vintageguitars.net uses cookies to remember your log-on data for the Want List (when you check the "remember me" box), and some of our sites use cookies to customize content. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many Guitar Center features that make your Web experience more efficient--like the features mentioned above--and some of our services will not function properly.<br><br>

<span class="px10"><img src="BTN_back.gif" alt="Privacy Top" width="14" height="10" border="0"><a href="#privacy">Privacy Top</a></span>

<a name="howused"></a>
<h4>How does Guitar Center use the personally identifiable information that has been collected?</h4>

Guitar Center uses personally identifiable information in a limited number of ways. We use the information to complete transactions. For instance, if you contact us to purchase an item on vintageguitars.net, we use your information to process your order, or if you contact us for help we will use the information to contact you. We use information collected to notify you if you've won a contest. Information we collect is used to send you e-mail updates and newsletters about our sites. We also use the information you provide to send you Guitar Center e-mail promotions and special offers from our third-party sponsors, affiliates and partners. And we use demographic data to customize and tailor your experience on our sites, displaying content that we think you might be interested in.<br><br>

<span class="px10"><img src="BTN_back.gif" alt="Privacy Top" width="14" height="10" border="0"><a href="#privacy">Privacy Top</a></span>

<a name="share"></a>
<h4>Does Guitar Center share information with companies or other organizations not a part of the Guitar Center network of sites?</h4>

You are one of the most valuable assets of our business. We aren't in the business of selling information about our Guests. However, if there is a value for our Guests, we will share your information or send you messages on behalf of another company as described below. We will also share information for security reasons.<br><br>

<b class="px11">Companies That Are "Standing in the Shoes" of Guitar Center</b><br>
Sometimes we hire companies to help us deliver products or services, like a shipping company that delivers a package. In those instances, we need to share your information with them. These companies are basically "standing in the shoes" of Guitar Center, and they are allowed to use the information only to deliver the product or service upon approval of Guitar Center only.<br><br>

<b class="px11">Companies Offering Promotions, Products, or Services</b><br>
On occasion, we offer promotions--like sweepstakes or free subscriptions--in conjunction with a sponsor. We will share your information with the sponsors if they need it to send you a product, such as a magazine subscription or contest prize. We may share your information with those sponsors so that they can send you other special promotions they offer, but only if you give us your permission to do so, and we will share it only with that specific sponsor. In addition, Guitar Center occasionally sends e-mail promotions out to our Guests on behalf of third-party sponsors. In this instance, we don't share your name with the third party--we do the mailing for them. Again, we only send these promotions to you if you've given your permission by signing up for our e-mail list.<br><br>

<b class="px11">Content Partners</b><br>
On some of our sites, we provide or link to content that is created by a third-party partner Web site. For example, some of our sites link to partner or affiliate sites that offer products or services. In some instances the third-party sites will collect information in order to facilitate the transaction or to make the use of their content more productive and efficient. In these circumstances the information collected may be shared between Guitar Center and our third-party sponsors. Third-party sponsors may also have their own privacy policies posted on their Web sites.<br><br>

<!-- comment out
<b class="px11">Third-Party Advertisers and Network Advertisers</b><br>
To help increase privacy protections for our Guests, Guitar Center allows advertising on our sites from only those companies that have their own privacy policy. Once you've clicked on an advertisement and have left Guitar Center sites, our privacy policy no longer applies. You must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their site. In addition, many business advertisements are managed and placed on our site by third-party companies. These companies are called &quot;network advertisers.&quot; Network advertisers collect non-personally identifiable information when you click on or scan one of their banner advertisements. The information is collected using technology, so you may not realize it's being collected. The network advertisers collect this information so that they can show you ads that are more relevant and interesting to you.<br><br>
-->

<b class="px11">Links to Other Outside Web Sites</b><br>
Our Web sites may contain links to outside Web sites with which we do not have affiliation, partnership or other cooperative agreement. Guitar Center does not share your personal information with those Web sites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.<br><br>

<b class="px11">Purchase or Sale of Businesses</b><br>
Online business is still in a very early stage and is changing and evolving rapidly. As Guitar Center continually looks for ways to improve our business, we may buy or sell a company. If we buy or sell a business, the names collected will likely be transferred as a part of the sale. Information about registrants will be used in the aggregate. However, if we buy a business, we will honor the requests that customers made of that business regarding e-mail communications. In the event that we sell a business, we will do everything in our power to ensure that the e-mail communications requests you made of us are honored.<br><br>

<b class="px11">Organizations That Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Guests and Our Sites</b><br>
We will give out personal information as required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our Terms of Service, or site rules; or to protect the safety and security of Guests and our sites.<br><br>

<span class="px10"><img src="BTN_back.gif" alt="Privacy Top" width="14" height="10" border="0"><a href="#privacy">Privacy Top</a></span>

<a name="choices"></a>
<h4>What choices do I have about Guitar Center collecting, using, and sharing my information?</h4>

It is possible for you to use much of our site without giving us any personally identifiable information. When you do register with us or give us personally identifiable information, you will have an opportunity at the time we collect your information to limit e-mail communications from Guitar Center and from our third-party partners. You can request at any time that Guitar Center not send future e-mail to you by unsubscribing by using the instructions included in each e-mail, or by filling out the remove form located here. Also, as mentioned above, there are ways to limit the information collected through technology--though some of our features won't work if you decide to do this. For the safety of minors, we request that children under the age of 18 not fill out any personal information on our Web sites without first receiving the approval of a parent or guardian.<br><br>

<a name="changes"></a>
<h4>Will you make changes to this privacy policy?</h4>

Our business changes constantly. This privacy policy may also change as we see the need for updates. Use of the information that we gather now is subject to the privacy policy in effect at time of use. We reserve the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, change, update or modify this privacy policy simply by posting such change, update or modification on the Web site. Any such change, update or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the Web site. You should check our Web site frequently to see the most recent version of this privacy policy.<br><br>
