                        automatically by the standard operation of our Internet servers. Information such as the type of
                        browser being used, its operating system, and your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address
                        (a number that your Internet service provider assigns to your computer whenever you surf the

                        proper legal process allows using such information. For instance, we may use your IP address or
                        other automatically recorded information, in cooperation with your Internet provider, to attempt
                        to identify you if it is necessary to contact you or to bring legal action against you because

                        You also have the right to request the deletion of your personal data. If you demonstrate that

                    <p><b>Safeguarding Your Personal Information</b></p>

                    <p>
                        Guitartabs.cc cares about the security of your Personal Information. We follow generally
                        accepted industry security standards to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain
                        data security and correctly use such Personal Information. Despite many advances in information
                        security technology and procedures, however, no commercially deployed method of information
                        transfer over the Internet or electronic data storage is known to be 100% secure. As a result,
                        while we do strive to use modern and commercially reasonable means to protect your Personal
                        Information, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its
                        transmission or its storage in our systems.

                    <p><b>International Operations and Transfers Out of Switzerland and the EEA</b></p>

                    <p>
                        Guitartabs.cc is a worldwide service. By using our Site, you authorize us to transfer and store
                        your information outside your home country, including in the United States, for the purposes
                        described in this Privacy Policy. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to
                        access your information in these countries may not be the same as in your home country.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We take additional measures when information is transferred from the European Economic Area
                        (EEA). This includes having standard clauses approved by the European Commission in our
                        contracts with parties that receive information outside the EEA. We also rely on European
                        Commission adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, for data transfers to
                        countries outside the EEA.

                    <p><b>For Parents Concerning the Privacy of Information on Their Children</b></p>

                    <p>
                        We are a general audience Site that does not knowingly collect data from children under 13 years
                        of age. Currently, we do not collect any age-specific data on our Site. If, in the future, we
                        decide to collect any age-specific data on our Site, we will, at a minimum, take reasonable
                        steps to ensure that any users who may be under 13 years of age are directed to another
                        Guitartabs.cc- related site which specifically complies with the requirements of the Children's
                        Online Privacy Protection Act.

                    <p><b>Cookies</b></p>

                    <p>
                        A "cookie" is a small text file that an Internet site can place on your computer's hard drive
                        for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make using this Site easier by, among other things, saving
                        your preferences for you and to help identify you whenever you return to our Site. Most Internet
                        browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. However, you can reset your browser to refuse
                        all cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent (note: you may need to consult your
                        browser's "Help" area for instructions on how to do that).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Some of our Site's pages may contain electronic images (called "Clear GIFs", "Single-Pixel
                        GIFs", or "Web Beacons") that allow us to count page views or to access cookies. In general, any
                        electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a Clear GIF.
                        Typically, though, Clear GIFs are very small (1-by-1 pixel size) files. They are often invisible
                        on a web page, but their presence can be detected within many Internet browsers by setting your
                        browser to view web page "sources". Clear GIFs are so small in order not to use valuable space
                        on the computer screen that is better used to display helpful content. We may also include Clear
                        GIFs in our email correspondence in order to determine information about the opening and reading
                        of such emails. In addition, some advertising networks that serve ads on our web Site may
                        occasionally use Clear GIFs within banner advertisements. Clear GIFs set by Guitartabs.cc
                        generally are not used to collect, gather, monitor, or share personal information about our
                        users, though they can be used in conjunction with cookies to record particular actions. We use
                        Clear GIFs primarily to compile aggregated, anonymous statistics about the Site or email usage.
