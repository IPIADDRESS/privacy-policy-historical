                  (such as your real name, address, phone number, or e-mail address). 
                  Generally, you may browse our Website without providing any 
                  PII. However, we may ask you to provide PII at various times 
                  and places on this Website, such as when you subscribe to our 
                  newsletter, register for a prayer request, send a DaySpring 
                  E-card, or participate in message groups or chat areas. We may

                  information received from promotional partners or other third

                  PII that you provide will be used to send the material to the

                  children's privacy is important to us. For that reason, we do

                  individuals we actually know are under the age of 13 with the 
                  exception of our two websites created for children, GuidepostsSweet16mag.com

                  Websites who are under the age of 13 not disclose or provide 
                  any PII without prior verifiable parental consent. If we discover 
                  that a child under 13 has provided us with PII without his or

                  When you visit this Website, our web servers automatically collect 
                  anonymous information that describes how our visitors use and 
                  navigate our Website, which includes the number and frequency 
                  of visitors to each web page and the length of their stays, 
                  as well as the anonymous information automatically sent to us 
                  by your web browser, such as browser type, referrer data that 
                  identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to your 
                  visit to our Website, and IP addresses. We also may determine 
                  what technology is available through your browser in order to 
                  serve you the most appropriate version of a web page. For example, 
                  we may determine that you have installed a version of Flash, 
                  and we will then send you the appropriate Flash version of the 
                  web page rather than an HTML page. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IP Addresses: 
                  An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer 
                  or network when you are on the Internet. It is usually associated 
                  with the place from which you enter the Internet, like your 
                  Internet Service Provider, your company or your university. 
                  When visitors request pages from our Website, our servers log 
                  the visitor's IP address. We may collect IP addresses for a 
                  variety of internal purposes, such as system administration, 
                  to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit 
                  the number of visits to different pages on our Website.</font></p>

                  Beacons: While you are on our Website, or while you are otherwise 
                  viewing our content, you may encounter Web beacons, which may 
                  come from Guideposts or from third parties, such as advertisers 
                  or content providers. A Web beacon, which is sometimes also 
                  called a Web bug or "clear gif," is a small graphic 
                  image in a Web page, a Web-based document or an e-mail message, 
                  which generally allows the party that set the Web beacon to 
                  monitor certain information about the viewer of the Web page, 
                  Web-based document or e-mail message, and may allow access to 
                  certain cookies. Web beacons are usually invisible to the user, 
                  because they are very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel). However, 
                  in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page, 
                  including an advertisement, can act as a Web beacon. Web beacons 
                  typically collect the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from, 
                  the type of browser requesting the Web beacon, the IP address 
                  of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to and the time 
                  the Web beacon was viewed. Guideposts does not have control 
                  over Web beacons used by third parties and does not have access 
                  to whatever information they may collect. Guideposts may use 
                  Web beacons to count visitors to our Web pages and we may include 
                  Web beacons in HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters in order to 
                  count how many of our electronic newsletters (or particular 
                  articles, links, etc.) were actually opened. We aggregate all 
                  information we collect through Web beacons and we do not use 
                  Web beacons to track any individuals' use of the Website. Web 
                  beacons can also be linked to PII. <br>

                  copyright owner, its agent, or the law; (v) an electronic or 
                  physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf

                  in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner 
                  or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf. By this 
                  filing, Guideposts does not necessarily stipulate that it is 
                  a service provider as defined in 17 USC section 512c or elsewhere 
                  in the law, but merely seeks to preserve any and all exemptions 
                  from liability that may be available under the copyright law. 
                  If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement 
                  has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to 
                  send Guideposts a counter-notice pursuant to the statutory requirements 
                  imposed by the DMCA, including, without limitation, a statement 
                  that the information in the notification is accurate, and under 
                  penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized 
                  to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is 
                  allegedly infringed. If we receive a proper notification (or 
                  if we believe in our sole and absolute discretion) that any 
                  materials submitted or posted by you allegedly violate another 
                  person's or entity's rights, we reserve the right to withdraw 
                  and remove the affected material from our Website, at any time

                  You are advised to consult a legal advisor before filing a notice 
                  or counter-notice. Please be forewarned that there can be penalties
