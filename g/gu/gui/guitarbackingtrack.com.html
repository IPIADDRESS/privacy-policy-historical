        identification purposes in the event of an emergency threatening life or property, or where proper legal process
        allows using such information. For instance, we may use your IP address or other automatically recorded
        information, in cooperation with your Internet provider, to attempt to identify you if it is necessary to
        contact you or to bring legal action against you because you are violating the Terms of Service for use for this
        Service, may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with our company's rights
        or property, or may be adversely affecting other users of this Service or anyone else who could be harmed by

    <h2>
        Personal Information You Provide To Us
    </h2>
    <p>
        We may request personally identifying information from you in a variety of contexts. For example, you may
        provide such data to us if you: (1) complete an online registration form (e.g., registering for an account,
        various sign-up forms for receiving email newsletters, registering for special offers, entering a
        contest/sweepstakes or responding to a survey); (2) fill out an order form to request information; (3) register
        to participate in message boards and chat rooms (if any) and other community features; or (4) purchase any
        products or services from us or another GuitarBackingTrack.com business. Additionally, when you ask for help
        from our Customer Support team, we will collect and store the contact information you give them (generally, your
        name and e-mail address), information about your activity on our Services, and your user name. We will also
        store the communications you have with the Customer Service team and any information in those communications in
        order to provide support.
    </p>
    <p>
        In such cases, the personally identifying information we request may include your name, email address, mailing
        address and zip code, phone number, and, where appropriate, a valid credit card number with expiration date
        (collectively, "Personal Information"). In addition, we may collect other non-personally identifying information
        such as your date of birth, gender, country of residence, language preference, hobbies and other information
        regarding your interaction with our Service such as your viewing and listening habits, preferences and other
        customized activities in which you participate. Of course, you never have to answer any of the questions we ask
        you (nor choose to view or listen to any multimedia content or otherwise interact with our Service), but refusal
        to do so may limit the products or services we can offer or provide to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you provide Personal Information to us, we may use that data to create a "<b>My Profile</b>" page for you, which
        will be held in a database using reasonable security measures to protect the data from unauthorized access.
        Others outside GuitarBackingTrack.com will not be allowed to see the data on your <b>My Profile Page</b> except with
        your consent (see below). If you register to set up an account, you will be able to access your <b>My Profile</b> page

        Correct or Review Your Personal Information?" for more details).

        Safeguarding Your Personal Information
    </h2>
    <p>
        GuitarBackingTrack.com cares about the security of your Personal Information. We follow generally accepted
        industry security standards to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and
        correctly use such Personal Information. When you provide credit card information, we use secure socket layer
        (SSL) encryption for that data.

    <p>
        Despite many advances in information security technology and procedures, however, no commercially deployed
        method of information transfer over the Internet or electronic data storage is known to be 100% secure. As a
        result, while we do strive to use modern and commercially reasonable means to protect your Personal Information,
        we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its transmission or its storage in our

        For Parents Concerning the Privacy of Information on Their Children

        We are a general audience Service that does not knowingly collect data or accept registrations from children
        under 13 years of age. Currently, we do not collect any age-specific data on our Service. If, in the future, we
        decide to collect any age-specific data on our Service, we will, at a minimum, take reasonable steps to ensure
        that any users who may be under 13 years of age (and who attempt to complete the registration process on our
        Service) are directed to another Service within the GuitarBackingTrack.com family which specifically complies
        with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA.

        International Operations and Transfers Out of Switzerland and the EEA
    </h2>
    <h2>
        IMPORTANT: When you use our Services, your data may be sent to the United States and possibly other countries.
    </h2>
    <p>
        As part of our international operations, we may transfer data to the GuitarBackingTrack.com Corporate Family
        from time to time for our legitimate business purposes. We may store information about users and visitors to our
        Service on servers located in the United States, and we may also store this information on servers and equipment
        in other countries. Personal Information collected within Switzerland and the European Economic Area (“EEA”) may
        be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of Switzerland and the EEA. The Personal Information we
        hold may also be processed by employees operating outside of Switzerland and the EEA who work for us or the
        GuitarBackingTrack.com Corporate Family or for one of our vendors. This staff may be engaged in, among other
        things, (i) the processing of transactions and your payment details and (ii) the provision of support services.
        When we transfer your Personal Information internationally we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your
        personal information is treated securely, lawfully and in the manner we describe here. Please note that laws
        vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and so the privacy laws applicable to the places where your Personal
        Information is transferred to or stored, used or processed in, may be different from the privacy laws applicable
        to the place where you are resident.

        Cookies
    </h2>
    <p>
        A "cookie" is a small text file that an Internet Service can place on your computer's hard drive for
        record-keeping purposes. Cookies make using this Service easier by, among other things, saving your passwords
        and preferences for you, keeping track of your shopping cart when you visit an online store or other similar
        purposes, and to help identify you whenever you return to our Service, so you do not need to reenter your
        identification information. Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. However, you can
        reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent (note: you may need to
        consult your browser's "Help" area for instructions on how to do that). If you choose to disable your cookies
        setting or refuse to accept a cookie, some parts of this Service will not function properly or may perform
        considerably slower. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences or you
        may have difficulty downloading backing tracks or utilizing the Community Forums. Some of our web pages may
        contain electronic images (called "Clear GIFs", "Single-Pixel GIFs", or "Web Beacons") that allow us to count
        page views or to access cookies. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad
        banner, can act as a Clear GIF. Typically, though, Clear GIFs are very small (1-by-1 pixel size) files. They are
        often invisible on a web page, but their presence can be detected within many Internet browsers by setting your
        browser to view web page "sources". Clear GIFs are so small in order not to use valuable space on the computer
        screen that is better used to display helpful content. We may also include Clear GIFs in our email products in
        order to determine information about the opening and reading of such emails. In addition, some advertising
        networks that serve ads on our web Service may occasionally use Clear GIFs within banner advertisements. Clear
        GIFs set by GuitarBackingTrack.com generally are not used to collect, gather, monitor, or share personal
        information about our users, though they can be used in conjunction with cookies to record particular actions.
        We use Clear GIFs primarily to compile aggregated, anonymous statistics about web Service or email product
        usage.
