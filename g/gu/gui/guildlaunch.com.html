                        <p><u>Children's Privacy Policy</u></p>  
                        <p>Because some of the games we support have players under the age of 13, Guild Launch has taken additional steps to help keep younger members safe online. While we have taken appropriate steps to encourage children to use Guild Launch carefully and responsibly, we also encourage parents and legal guardians to spend time online with their children so that they understand the services and sites their children are participating in online. Please remind children to never give out their personal information online without permission.</p>
                        <p>In compliance with Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ('COPPA'), we have adopted the following policies regarding children under the age of 13 ('Children'):</p>
                        <p>Type and Use of Information Collected from Children </p>
                        <p>To create a Free Account, Guild Launch requires an e-mail address as well as a parent or legal guardian's email address for verification. </p>
                        <p>To upgrade a member's account, Guild Launch requires parent's correct billing information. As stated in our Terms of Service, no user under the age of 18 is permitted to complete transactions on our platform that require a purchase via credit card or other payment method.</p>
                        <p>For Free Accounts, we use your Parent or Legal Guardian e-mail address for the following purposes: </p>
                        <p>To send a confirmation notice to the parent of their child's account registration and to request your verification that they have your consent to use an account on Guild Launch.</p>
                        <p>To prompt you to create a Guild Launch account that is the registered Parent or Legal Guardian account for your child's account, granting access to review activity, revoke and permit access to Guild Launch for your dependent account(s).</p>
                        <p>We reserve the right to disclose your child's personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web Sites. </p>
                        <p>Guild Launch may periodically use newsletters to notify our users of all the upcoming changes, upgrades, service downtime etc. We may also alert members to special offers though Launch Media Network partners. </p>
                        <p>Notification and Verifiable Parental Consent </p>
                        <p>At this time, whenever Guild Launch is aware that a user is under the age of 13, Guild Launch requires the child submit the parent's email address. We will then provide proper parental notice of the child's use of the site, including access to review their account. When purchasing account upgrades, the receipt of payment is considered actual, verifiable consent from the parents to the child's use of our website and to any information that was divulged as reasonably necessary to process payments, verify and maintain the account.</p>
