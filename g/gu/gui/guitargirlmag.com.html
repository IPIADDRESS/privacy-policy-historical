<p><strong>How We Use Information:</strong><br> <br> We never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers.

Also, they may be able to tell if you are currently logged on to the website.</p>
<p>The information you provide about yourself when placing an order is not provided to others. This information is used only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be necessary to transmit some necessary information to third-parties for the purposes of completing financial transactions.<br> <br> We use the information you provide about someone else only to send requested information, ship an ordered product, and/or to confirm delivery.

Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong>:</p>
