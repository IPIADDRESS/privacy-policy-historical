<p>NGC tracks the keywords that are entered into our search engine and the browse terms used to measure interest in specific topics, but we do not monitor which terms a particular user enters.</p>
<p><b>
Cookie Disclaimer</b> -  A "cookie" is information stored on your computer by a Web server and used to customize your web service in some way.

Currently, the NGC Web site uses "cookies" to remember whether a user has viewed the NGC Disclaimer statement and to store information in the users' Guideline Collection. NGC does not use "cookie" information for any other purpose, nor does it make the information available to anyone else.  </p>
<p>You can choose not to accept cookies and still use the NGC Web site.  However, you will be unable to use the cookie-dependent features.  Refer to the help information in your browser software for instructions on how to disable cookies.</p>

<p><b>
Personally Provided Information</b></p>
<p>
You do not have to give us personal information to visit our Web site. If you choose to provide us with additional information about yourself through an E-mail message, form, survey, etc., we will only maintain the information as long as needed to respond to your question or to fulfill the stated purpose of the communication.. The information provided is handled on a confidential basis. However, E-mail is not necessarily secure against interception.

Electronically submitted information is maintained and destroyed according to the principles of the Federal Records Act and regulations and guidance from the National Archives and Records Administration, and in some cases may be subject to the Privacy Act.
