				<li><em>Companies Not Controlled.</em> This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Gusto.com does not own or control, or to people that Gusto.com does not employ or manage.</li>

			</ol></li>
			<li><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</strong>
			<ol type="A">
				<li><em>General</em>
				<ol>
					<li>Collection.  Gusto.com collects personal information when you register with Gusto.com, when you use Gusto.com products or services, when you visit Gusto.com pages or the pages of certain Gusto.com partners, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. Gusto.com may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.</li>
					<li>Information Sought and Collected.  When you register with Gusto.com, we ask for personal information such as your name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests and other information that that is not otherwise publicly available.  For some financial products and services, we may also ask for your address, Social Security number, and information about your assets. Once you register with Gusto.com and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. Gusto.com also collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of financial products and services that we offer.</li>

					<li>IP Address.  Gusto.com's Web server automatically recognizes a visitor's domain name or IP address.  An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet.  As part of the protocol of the Internet, Web servers can identify your computer by its IP address.  In addition, Web servers may be able to identify the type of browser you are using or even the type of computer. We collect IP addresses and related information for the purposes of system administration, to assess the traffic to our Web site and to maintain and improve our Web site. Although it is not our practice to link IP addresses to your personally identifiable information, we reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a member when we feel it is necessary to protect the compelling interest of our Web site, members of our Web site or others or to comply with laws, court orders, or law enforcement requests.</li>
					<li>Use.  Gusto.com uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, assist us in providing better products and services, contact you, conduct research, service your account with us and respond to your questions, and to provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><em>Information Sharing and Disclosure</em>
				<ol>
					<li>Sharing of Personal Information. Gusto.com does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with nonaffiliated persons or  companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
					<ol type="a">

						<li>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Gusto.com under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Gusto.com communicate with you about offers from Gusto.com and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have the right to share your personal information or use it for any other reason.</li>
						<li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;</li>
						<li>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Gusto.com's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law; and</li>
						<li>We transfer information about you if Gusto.com is acquired by or merged with another company.  In such event, Gusto.com will notify you before your information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Ad Targeting.  Gusto.com displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.
					<ol type="a">

						<li>Gusto.com does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad.  However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.</li>

			<ol type="A">
				<li><em>Rights Reserved.</em>  Gusto.com may set and access Gusto.com cookies on your computer. Cookies are short strings of text sent from a Web server to a Web browser when the browser accesses a Web site. In simplest terms, when the browser requests a page from the Web server that originally sent it the cookie, the browser sends a copy of the cookie back to that Web server. A cookie typically contains, among other things, the name of the cookie, a unique identification number, and an expiration date and domain name information. Cookies are used for personalization, tracking and other purposes. Cookies may be "session-only" or "persistent." Persistent cookies last for more than one visit and are typically used to allow a visitor to our Web site to personalize their experience. We may use cookies to analyze the traffic on our Web site (such as total visitors and pages viewed), to personalize features or save you the trouble of retyping your name or other information, and to make improvements to the Web site based on the data we collect. We do not save passwords or other sensitive information in cookies. The use of cookies has become a standard in the Internet industry, especially at Web sites that provide any kind of personalized service. The use of cookies by content providers and advertisers has become standard practice in the Internet industry.</li>
				<li><em>This Policy Not Applicable to Other Companies.</em> Gusto.com lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Gusto.com's cookies.</li>
