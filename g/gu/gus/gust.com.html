<h3>
Can third parties see my personal data?
</h3>

<h4>
If you are an investor

The Gust Platform allows the administrator of an investor group the ability to set certain settings in the profile of the members of the investor group. Thus, for each investor group, the group administrator decides which information is available for access or review by third parties, and which information is not to be disclosed, or is disclosed to selected third parties, according to the policies of the investor group.

<p>
Please note that (1)
<b>
the default settings that are set by a group administrator may change from time to time;

<h3>
With whom may we share personal data?
</h3>
<p>
Under certain business or legal conditions, Gust may have to disclose your personal data to others as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>
Service Providers
</h4>
<p>
Gust may engage other companies and individuals to perform necessary business functions on behalf of Gust (e.g. outside contractors or service providers).

All registered users of the Gust website can have access to the personal data that Gust holds about them and is listed in their profiles. They can correct, amend, or delete this data at their convenience and on their own time.

<p>
For auditing and security purposes, Gust keeps a log of all users' activities, which is retained in its archives as necessary for Gust to fulfill its obligations. Users may be able to have access to the personal data that pertain to them. However, the administrative and technical burden associated with the retrieval of these archived data is substantial. Gust would need to be compensated for this effort in a manner that is consistent with its actual cost. In addition, each user's right of access may be limited to the extent that providing access might infringe on a third party's privacy rights. Requests for access to this archived information are handled on a case-by-case basis, after Gust has verified the identity of the requestor. Inquiries should be made as provided in the section

What is Aggregated Data, and how is it used?

</p>
<a id="section12" name="section12"></a>
<h3>
What is Aggregated Data, and how is it used?
</h3>
<p>
Data aggregation is a process in which information is gathered and expressed in a summary form for purposes such as statistical analysis, in order to obtain information about a particular group based on specific variables. Data used for aggregation purposes are collected in a form that removes all identifiers, and may be combined with other data for which all identifiers have also been removed. Gust uses aggregated data to generate accurate metrics about the early stage private equity industry.
</p>
<p>
Aggregated data are packaged and licensed to third parties such as governments, economic development agencies, and financial institutions. Examples of aggregated data may include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Data about the early equity space, such as number of deals in a month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter basis at various generic stages of the funding process (e.g. New Deals, In Progress Deals, Inactive Deals, and Invested Deals).
</li>
<li>
Data about industries and geographies related to companies seeking investors and those successfully obtaining investments.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>

</h3>

Examples include the number of visitors to the gust.com web site and the number of registered users of the Gust platform.

</p>
<p>
Action tags allow us to better understand how users and visitors use our site or  browse through our pages, so that we can improve access to and navigation through the site, add or modify pages, according to our user's patterns.
