      <h3>Information We Collect When You Browse Our Website</h3>
      <p>We do not access information about your identity while you browse  our website.

We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customersâ personally identifiable information. </p>

        <li>When you explicitly instruct us (Opt-In) to forward your  application to another lender. Example: You may consider it beneficial  for us to forward you loan application to another lender who may be  able to help you in the event we are unable to offer you a loan that  meets your needs. You may find this convenient since it means you may  not need to search for another lender or complete another loan  application.
