  	</p>

  	<h2 class="h4">How and why we collect personal information</h2>
  	<p>
  		You provide nonpublic personal information to us so that we may help you try to meet your financial goals. Such information allows us to process your requests and transactions, keep you apprised of products and services that may be of interest to you, and enhance customer service by better understanding your financial needs. This information may include:
  	</p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>Information we receive from you on applications or other forms (such as phone, Social Security and account numbers, assets, income and employment history);</li>
  		<li>Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or  others (such as your loan balance, payment history and other account  information);</li>
  		<li>Information we receive from mortgage settlement service providers (such as consumer reporting agencies); </li>
  		<li>Information collected from your web browser when you visit our websites (such as date, time and areas of our websites that were visited).</li>
  	</ul>

  	<h2 class="h4">Information we collect when you browse our website</h2>
  	<p>
  		We do not access information about your identity while you browse our website. Although we collect information about the date, time and area of our website that you visited, you remain anonymous to us. Only if you decide to apply for a loan with us directly or through a broker, do we collect any personally identifying information about you.
  	</p>

  	<h3 class="h6">Cookies</h3>
  	<p>
  		Guaranteed Rate, Inc. uses a variety of third-party services to help provide the most streamlined and user-friendly website possible. We also use third parties such as Google Analytics to help us understand how our visitors use our website. These third-parties may collect certain information from your browser (i.e. using cookies and/or your IP address), and may tailor your ads so that you see Guaranteed Rate advertisements on other websites. To learn more, or to opt-out of receiving online display advertisements tailored to your interests by our third party partners, visit the Network Advertising Initiative at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a>. If you prefer, you can adjust your privacy settings in your browser so that your information is not tracked.

  	<p>
  		A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		We use session cookies to tailor your experience on our site. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

  		The use of cookies by third parties, including but not limited to our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers is not covered by our privacy statement.

Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
  	</p>

  	<h3 class="h6">Access to information</h3>
  	<p>
  		If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may request us to correct, update, ,delete,deactivate it by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:customercare@guaranteedrate.com">customercare@guaranteedrate.com</a>. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.
