<h2 id="2">Information We Collect by Automated Means&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</h2>

<p>When you visit and interact with our websites and applications, we may collect "Other Information” that does not inherently reveal your specific identity, in order to learn how to best tailor our websites for our visitors.&nbsp; Examples of what Other Information we may collect and how we and third-party service providers may collect this information include:&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i>Aggregation Information</i></b> – Aggregated user information does not personally identify you or any other user (for example, we may aggregate user information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).&nbsp; Aggregated data is treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i>App Usage Data</i></b> – When you download and use an App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.</p>

<p><b><i>Browser and Device Information </i></b>– Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your computer type, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the online services (such as the Apps) you are using.&nbsp; We use this information to ensure that the online services function properly.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i>Cookies</i></b> –&nbsp; Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer or mobile device that you are using.&nbsp; Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the online services, pages visited, referring URL, and other aggregated website traffic data.&nbsp; We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to collect statistical information and to personalise your experience while online.</p>

<p>Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the online services or to send you advertisements and marketing emails.&nbsp; We may also use cookies or other technologies to track responses to our online advertisements and marketing emails.&nbsp; You can opt out of such interest-based advertising using cookies set by participating NAI members at: http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/.&nbsp; Opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean you will no longer see advertising online. It does mean that the company or companies from which you opt out will no longer show ads that have been tailored to your interests.</p>

<p>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser or, depending on your jurisdiction, by managing your tracking preferences as noted in a separately posted cookie statement or via a posted cookie manager.&nbsp; If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the online services.&nbsp; For example, we may not be able to recognise your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit. You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that are relevant to your interests and needs.&nbsp; At this time, we do not respond to browser “Do-Not-Track” signals except in jurisdictions where we are required to do so by law.</p>

<p><b><i>IP Address</i></b> – Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).&nbsp; An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the online services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services.&nbsp; We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems and administering our online services.&nbsp; We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address to understand from what regions of the world our website visitors come.</p>

<p><b><i>Physical Location and Mobile Location-Based Services</i></b> – We may collect the physical location of your device if you have consented to us doing so, by, for example, using satellite, mobile phone tower, WiFi signals or other technologies.&nbsp; We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalised location-based services and content.</p>

<p>If you have downloaded one of our Apps, you may enrol to receive offers by agreeing to the use of technologies that enable us to collect information about your location through your mobile device’s Bluetooth or similar capabilities.&nbsp; We will collect this information if you opt-in through the App (either during your initial login or later) to receive the offers and by enabling these capabilities on your mobile device.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i>Pixel Tags or Similar Technologies</i></b> – Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some online services to, among other things, track the actions of users of the online services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the online services and response rates.&nbsp; We also use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyse information about use of our services and report on activities and trends.&nbsp; These services may collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources.&nbsp; You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/,and opt-out by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i>Marketing Partners </i></b>–<i>&nbsp;</i>In some cases, we may permit certain network advertising companies and publishers to collect personal information on our sites.&nbsp; In addition, our business partners may access personal information about you that we have combined with such business partners’ data. We may collaborate with our business partners to jointly send tailored promotional communications to you using the combined set of information.&nbsp; If you prefer not to receive these joint communications, you can opt out by following the instructions included in any such communication.</p>

<p><b><i>Non-Personal Information </i></b>–&nbsp;We may share non-personal information, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic information, and usage information with third parties.</p>

<p><b><i>Sharing With Your Consent </i></b>–&nbsp;Our services may present you with the opportunity to opt in to receive information or marketing offers from third parties or to otherwise consent to the sharing of your information with third parties. If you agree to have your personal information shared, your personal information will be disclosed to the third-party subject to the privacy notice and business practices of that third party.</p>

<p><b><i>Third-Party Service Providers </i></b>–&nbsp;In order to carry out your requests, to make various features, services and materials available to you through the services, to respond to your enquiries, and for other purposes described in the “How We Use Your Information” section of this Privacy Policy, we may share your personal information or usage information with third parties that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners), such as companies or individuals that: host or operate our sites; analyse data; provide customer service; mail product samples or manage payments; advertisers; sponsors or other third parties that participate in or administer our promotions, eCommerce activities, provide marketing or promotional assistance (such as in connection with winner selection, prize fulfilment, and as required by law, such as on a winners list), or assist with risk management, compliance, legal and audit functions. These service providers are not authorised by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.</p>

<p>Because we operate as part of a global business, the recipients referred to above may be located outside the jurisdiction in which you are located (or in which we provide the services). See the section on “International Transfers of Personal Information” below for more information.</p>

<h2 id="4">Automated Decisions About You&nbsp;</h2>

<p>We may make automated decisions about you using your personal information in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Automated processing may be used when evaluating large numbers of applicants for job vacancies. For these purposes we would request that you create a profile and answer some job-related questions to evaluate your skills as compared to the published job requirements.&nbsp; An algorithm may then be used to determine which candidates will be allowed to proceed to the next step within the selection process. We consider this data and process to be relevant because it will assist us to select the applicant most suitable for our vacancies.&nbsp; The outcome of the evaluation may have an impact on whether you are offered a role for the vacancy you apply to.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>You can contact us via the contact information provided in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy to request further information about automated decision-making, object to our use of automated decision-making, or request an automated decision to be reviewed by us if required by local law.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="5">User-Generated Content</h2>

<p>Some of our services and social networking features may enable you to submit your own content for public posting.&nbsp; Information you post in this fashion becomes public information and is not subject to this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Certain areas of our websites and our social media pages may enable users to submit personal information to Koch Industries or its affiliates.&nbsp; Such information will be used in accordance with the website’s Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Postings, letters and other submissions become the property of Koch Industries and may be reproduced in whole or in part, including your name, for any purpose and in any manner.</p>

<h2 id="6">Links to Other Sites<i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</i></h2>

<p>Our websites and communications may provide links to other websites, including to social networks or partners that may use our logo(s) as part of a co-branding agreement.&nbsp; To the extent that any linked services are not provided by Koch Industries, we are not responsible for the services, or any of the content found on these websites.&nbsp; If you provide information on and use third-party services or websites, the privacy policy and terms of service on those sites are applicable.&nbsp; We encourage you to read the privacy policies of websites that you visit before submitting personal information.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="7">How We Protect Personal Information<i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</i></h2>

<p>In proportion to the sensitivity of the information, we maintain reasonable administrative, technical and/or physical safeguards and appropriate security measures to protect personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the information you provide.&nbsp; However, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information, as no electronic data transmission or storage of information is completely secure.&nbsp; If an incident is reported affecting your information, we will investigate and comply with all required reporting obligations.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="8">International Transfers of Personal Information</h2>

<p>Koch Industries is a global organisation - headquartered in the United States – that does business in many countries.&nbsp; We may share your personal information among Koch Industries, its affiliates, our service providers, and other third parties that may be located in countries outside of your own.&nbsp; Although the data protection laws of these various countries may differ from those in your own country, we have put in place appropriate safeguards (such as contractual commitments) to ensure that your personal information is handled as described in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with the law. For transfers of data outside of the European Union, this includes standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission. For more information on the appropriate safeguards in place, please contact us via the contact information provided in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="9">How Long is Personal Information Retained</h2>

<p>We will keep your personal information for as long as we have a relationship with you.&nbsp; Once our relationship with you has come to an end, we will retain your personal information for a period of time that enables us to:</p>

	<li>Comply with record retention requirements under the law</li>
	<li>Defend or bring any existing or potential legal claims</li>
	<li>Address any complaints regarding the services</li>
</ul>

<p>We will delete your personal information when it is no longer required for these purposes.&nbsp; If there is any information that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further processing or use of the data.</p>

<h2 id="10">Changing and Accessing Your Personal Information</h2>

<p>You may have certain rights regarding your personal information, subject to local law.&nbsp; These include the following rights to:</p>

	<li>lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority (if applicable).</li>
</ul>

<p>We encourage you to contact us to update or correct your information if it changes or if the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate.&nbsp; Please note that we will likely require additional information from you in order to verify your identity and respond to your requests.&nbsp; If you would like to discuss or exercise your applicable rights, subject to limitations established under local law, please contact us via the contact information provided in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy. We will respond to you within a reasonable time and within the time limits established by applicable law.</p>

<h2 id="12">California Residents</h2>

<p>If you are a California resident and have provided us with your personal information, you may ask us to refrain from sharing your personal information with third parties, including our affiliates if they are separate legal entities, for direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; Please tell us your preference by contacting us via the contact information in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2 id="13">Updates to Our Privacy Policy<i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</i></h2>

<p>We may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will always indicate at the top of the Policy when it was most recently updated.&nbsp; If we substantially change this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of the changes. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting unless otherwise indicated.&nbsp; Where changes to this Privacy Policy will have a fundamental impact on the nature of processing or otherwise have a substantial impact on you, we will give you sufficient advance notice so that you have the opportunity to exercise your rights. &nbsp;</p>
