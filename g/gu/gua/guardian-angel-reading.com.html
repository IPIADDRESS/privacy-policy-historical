<em>Last Update: December 2014</em></p>
<p>Sesam would like to thank you for visiting <a href="//www.guardian-angel-reading.com">www.guardian-angel-reading.com</a> and your interest in our products and services. Your privacy is important to us and we want you to feel comfortable while visiting our website. This document explains clearly and simply which of your personal data are collected by our website and how these personal data are used. You will also find essential information on your rights with regard to the sharing, transmission, alteration or deletion of this information. Please read this document carefully so that you fully understand our privacy policy. This privacy policy is subject to any applicable mandatory local laws and regulations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you do not agree to this privacy policy, do not proceed to further web pages of the <a href="//www.guardian-angel-reading.com">www.guardian-angel-reading.com</a> website.</p>
<h2>What is to be considered when data is transferred over the internet?</h2>
<p>The internet is generally not regarded as a completely secure environment, and information sent via the internet can be accessed by unauthorized third parties. Even if both sender and receiver are located in the same country, information sent via the internet may be transmitted across international borders and be forwarded to a country with a lower data protection level than exists in your country of residence. Please note that we accept no responsibility for the security of your information whilst in transit over the internet to Sesam.</p>
<h2>What information is collected?</h2>
<p>We do not collect your personal data through our website unless you voluntarily provided such data that could be used to identify a person. Through its website, <a href="//www.guardian-angel-reading.com">www.guardian-angel-reading.com</a> stores several categories of personal data.</p>
<p>In order to receive your free lucky numbers, you will need to provide the following information: title, surname, first name, date and time of birth, e-mail address and country of residence.</p>
<p>If you decide to order the ‘Great Angelic Revelations’ (chargeable), you will then need to enter the following information: full address, telephone number, credit card details.</p>
<p>You enter your confidential credit card details within a secure area managed entirely by our payment processors or PCI DSS-compliant suppliers. Sesam does not have access to this entirely secure area under any circumstances.</p>
<p>There is no obligation to buy. When you visit <a href="//www.guardian-angel-reading.com">www.guardian-angel-reading.com</a>, our web server may also automatically collect your IP address. Furthermore, our web server may automatically collect certain generic information which does not identify you personally such as your web browser, your operating system or your Internet service provider.</p>
<h2>How is this information used?</h2>
<p>All the personal data and other information which you have entered are solely used in order to provide you with the service(s) and/or products which you requested on <a href="//www.guardian-angel-reading.com">www.guardian-angel-reading.com</a> and for the purposes of technical administration, research and development of the Sesam website, customer and end user administration and marketing (hereinafter “Services” and “Products”). A secret algorithm based on your surname, first name and date of birth enables us to generate your free trial offer, as well as all the personalised psychic reading products which you can order.</p>
<p>Your e-mail address may be used to send you the Products and Services which you ordered on <a href="//www.guardian-angel-reading.com">www.guardian-angel-reading.com</a>.

You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link you can find in each e-mail we send you. We will then remove your contact information from the lists used for such mailings.</p>
<h2>In which cases will this information be disclosed?</h2>
<p>Sesam may disclose your information to its employees, agents and affiliates inside or outside your country of residence to perform Services for Sesam. Our employees, agents, affiliates and third party providers who have access to personal data obtained through the Sesam website are obliged to respect privacy.</p>

For example, sometimes a third party may have access to your personal data in order to fulfil an order, support our information technology or help compile and manage the data.</p>
<p>When transferring personal data internationally we make sure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations and take steps to make sure that the recipients of your information maintain an adequate level of data protection.</p>

Your personal data may also be disclosed if Sesam decides that it is necessary to hold an enquiry or take measures regarding potentially illegal activities in the event of threat to the personal security of any individual, or if you are in breach of the Service’s and/or Product’s <a title="Legal Terms" href="/legal-terms/">General Terms and Conditions of Use.</a></p>
