("GREE," "us," or "we") collects, uses, stores, manages and discloses information, including personal information, that our users ("you" or "users") provide or we collect in connection with our websites at <a href="http://gree.net" target="_blank" title="click to visit gree.net">gree.net</a>, <a href="http://gree-support.net" target="_blank" title="click for our support site">gree-support.net</a> and <a href="http://gree-corp.com" target="_blank" title="click to visit gree-corp.com">gree-corp.com</a> (the "Site") or any GREE game or other application or services available on other websites or other third party sources (collectively,the "Service").

      </section>

      <h3 class="headings3">Information Collected and How it is Used</h3>
      <ul class="discList">
      <li>The main purposes for which GREE collects your information are:</li>
      <li>To provide and enhance GREE's games and the Service</li>

      <section class="legalSec">

You should review these third parties' terms of service and privacy policies, which are separate from GREE's.</p>

      <li><span class="italic">As permitted by or to comply with law or to protect rights.</span><br>

      </section>

      <section class="legalSec">
      <h3 class="headings3">Cookies, Web Beacons and Third Party Advertisements</h3>
      <p>A "cookie" is a data file that is transferred to a user's computer and is intended to identify that computer.  Cookies also are used to maintain
      information about a user's visit to a site or game, such as user names, passwords and individual preferences. The Service sends cookies to your
      computer when you access a GREE game or view content of a game. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your personal information.  That information may be used for a variety of purposes including improving the quality and ease of use of the Service and making recommendations more specific to you.</p>
      <p>GREE may also collect information using "Web beacons" or "gifs." These are electronic images that may be used on the Site or in email to deliver cookies, count visits and to tell if an email has been opened and actioned.</p>
      <p>The Service may include third party advertisements.  These ads may be served by third party advertising companies that deliver cookies to your computer, allowing these companies to track the ads. As a result, these companies will be able to recognize your computer when they send you an advertisement. These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Service in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="legalSec">

      </section>

      <section class="legalSec">
      <h3 class="headings3">Advertisements</h3>

      <h3 class="headings3">International Transfer of Information</h3>
      <p>GREE may transfer information (including personal information) that we collect about you to our affiliates or to other third parties that may be outside of your country. If you are located in the European Union or in another country or jurisdiction, such locations may have laws governing data collection and use that differ from U.S. law.

      <h3 class="headings3">Security</h3>
      <p>GREE implements reasonable security measures to protect the security of your information and is committed to protect customer information.</p>
      <p>It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and that you immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account.<br>
      If you forget the password to your account, the Site allows you to ask for instructions on how to reset your password. When you sign into your account or enter payment information (such as a credit card number when purchasing virtual currency), the transmission of that information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology ("SSL").</p>
      <p>Although GREE takes reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our websites and records, no Internet transmission is completely secure.  Accordingly, GREE cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We strongly recommend that you take steps to keep your personal information secure (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use. If you have questions about security, please visit our support page located at <a href="http://gree-support.net" target="_blank" title="gree support">http://gree-support.net</a></p>

      <section class="legalSec">
      <h3 class="headings3">Modifications to this Policy</h3>
      <p>GREE may modify this Policy from time to time.  We will post all changes to this Policy on this page or another location on the Site and the modified policy will specify its effective date.  You are obligated to check the Site to confirm whether the Policy has been modified.</p>
