			<h2><b>Live Nation Entertainment Privacy Policy- Your Privacy Rights</b></h2>

<div id="last_updated" style="float:right">(last updated July 24, 2015)</div>

<h3><u>This Privacy Policy applies to the sites and apps where it appears.</u></h3>

<p>This Policy describes how we treat personal information we collect both online and offline. This includes on our websites or in our apps. It also includes at our box offices or in phone or email interactions you have with us. If you live in Canada, please read our <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.ca/h/privacy.html" target="_blank"> Canadian Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h4><u>We collect information from and about you.</u></h4>

<p><b>Contact information.</b> For example, we might collect your name and street address. We might also collect your phone number or email.</p>

<p><b>Payment and billing information.</b> For example, we collect your credit card number and zip code when you buy a ticket.</p>

<p><b>Information you post.</b> For example, we collect information you post in a public space on our website or on a third-party social media site.</p>

<p><b>Demographic information.</b> We may collect information about events you like or products you buy. We might collect this as part of a survey, for example.</p>

<p><b>Other information.</b> If you use our website, we may collect information about the browser you are using. We might look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us. If you use our mobile app, we may collect your GPS location or your device's unique identifier. We might also collect the type of mobile device you are using, or the version of the operating system your computer or device is running. We might look at how often you use the app and where you downloaded it.</p>

<h4><u>We collect information in different ways.</u></h4>

<p><b>We collect information directly from you.</b> For example, if you register for a promotion or buy tickets. We also collect information if you post a comment on our websites or ask us a question.</p>

<p><b>We collect information from you passively.</b> We use tracking tools like browser cookies and web beacons. To learn more about these tools and to control them, please click <a href="#adchoices">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>We get information about you from third parties.</b> For example, if you use an integrated social media feature on our websites or mobile applications. The third-party social media site will give us certain information about you. This could include your name and email address. Your activities on our sites and apps may be posted to the social media platforms.</p>

<h4><u>We use information as disclosed and described here.</u></h4>

<p><b>We use information to respond to your requests or questions.</b> For example, we might use your information to confirm your registration for an event or contest. If you give us your friend's information, we will only use it to provide services you requested.</p>

<p><b>We use information to improve our products and services.</b> We might use your information to customize your experience with us. This could include displaying content based upon your preferences.</p>

<p><b>We use information to look at site trends and customer interests.</b> We may use your information to make our website and products better. We may combine information we get from you with information about you we get from third parties.</p>

<p><b>We use information for security purposes.</b> We may use information to protect our company, our customers, or our websites.</p>

These might be our own offers or products, or third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting. Or, for example, if you buy tickets from us we'll enroll you in our newsletter. We may use push notifications and your location information on our mobile apps to send you alerts regarding local events. To learn about your choices for these communications, read the <a href="#adchoices">choices section</a> below.</p>

<p><b>We use information as otherwise permitted by law.</b></p>

<h4><u>We may share information with third parties.</u></h4>

<p><b>We will share information within the Live Nation family of companies.</b> This may include Ticketmaster and Live Nation-owned or operated venues, for example.</p>

<p><b>We will share information with our business partners.</b> This includes a third party who provides or sponsors an event, or who operates a venue where we hold events. Our partners use the information we give them as described in their privacy policies. You should read those polices to learn how they treat your information.</p>

<p><b>We may share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves.</b> For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena. We may also share it if a government agency or investigatory body requests. Or, we might also share information when we are investigating potential fraud. This might include fraud we think has happened during a sweepstakes or promotion.</p>

<p><b>We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business.</b> For example, if part of our business is sold we may give our customer list as part of that transaction.</p>

<p><b>We may share your information for reasons not described in this policy.</b> We will tell you before we do this.</p>

<h4><u>You have certain choices about how we use your information.</u></h4>

<p><b>You can opt out of receiving our marketing emails.</b> To stop receiving our promotional emails, follow the instructions in any promotional message you get from us. Your device settings should provide you with instructions on how to turn off push notifications. It may take about ten days to process your request. Don't worry! Even if you opt out of getting marketing messages, we will still be sure to send you transactional messages. For example, we may still contact you about your orders.</p>

<p><b>You can modify information you have given us.</b> To modify or delete information you gave us, log into your account and follow the instructions to modify your profile. We make changes as soon as we can. This information may stay in our backup files. If we cannot make the changes you want, we will let you know and explain why. If you contact us requesting access to your information, we will respond within 30 days.</p>
