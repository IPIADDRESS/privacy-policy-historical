                GunBroker.com
                has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to
                your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination
                practices for this Web site.
                <p>
                    <b>General</b></p>
                <p>
                    Our site's registration form requires users to give us valid and accurate contact
                    information (like your name and email address) and financial information (like your
                    account or credit card numbers). The customer's contact information is used to contact
                    the customer when necessary. Financial information that is collected is used to
                    bill the user for products and services and to collect on debts incurred through
                    the use of this site. Other than to facilitate the completion of an auction transaction
                    as specified below or for billing and collections purposes, contact and financial
                    information is never shared with any third party.</p>
                <p>
                    If you place a bid on an item, your contact information including name, address,
                    email, and telephone number may be shared with the seller to facilitate the transaction.
                    If you list an item for sale, your contact information including name, address,
                    email, and telephone number may be shared with the bidder(s) to facilitate the transaction.
                    To facilitate the investigation of fraud or illegal activity we may turn information
                    over to bona-fide law enforcement agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    If you incur fees through the use of this site we use your contact information and
                    financial information for billing and collections purposes. If your account is past
                    due and collection must be pursued, your contact and financial information may be
                    shared with collection agents and/or credit reporting agencies. Other than to collect
                    debts we do not share your financial information with any third party.</p>
                <p>
                    We do not do unsolicited mailings. Any email messages generated by
                    GunBroker.com
                    result directly from the user's actions (such as registration information, confirmation
                    of placing a bid, confirmation of listing an item), or as necessary to inform you
                    of changes to the auction site or events related to the auction site, or changes
                    to the auction site rules. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the
                    choice/opt-out section below.</p>

                <p>
                    This site has substantial security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse
                    and alteration of the information under our control. Our servers are locked in private
                    cabinets within a secure data center with 24 hour security monitoring and passkey/biometric
                    access. Our database is password protected using strong security to prevent access
                    by unauthorized persons. We employ hardware firewalls to protect our servers from
                    intrusion. All financial transactions are encrypted at the highest level possible,
                    and our credit card processing and data storage techniques meet or exceed the requirements

                    <b>Choice / Opt-out</b></p>
                <p>
                    This site sends three types of email communications: 1. notifications related to
                    auction activity, 2. 'Saved Search' notifications, and 3. opt-in newsletters and
                    promotional email messages.</p>
                <p>
                    1. Notifications related to auction activity are generated as a result or registering
                    for the auction site, bidding on items, or listing items for sale. These notifications
                    can include bid confirmations, winning bidder notices, item listing confirmations,
                    item sold notifications, monthly statements, billing messages, and other notifications
                    related to activity on the auction site. You cannot opt out of receiving notifications
                    related to auction activity, however, if you do not bid nor list items and your
                    account balance is zero you will not receive any such notifications from this site.</p>
                <p>
                    If you are a registered buyer or seller on this auction site we may send you certain
                    notices, such as notices of a substantial change in the policies and/or operation
                    of our site. These notices are sent extremely infrequently and cannot be opted out
                    of other than by closing your account with us.</p>
                <p>
                    2. Saved Search notifications are generated at your request to inform you when items
                    matching certain search criteria have been listed on the auction site. There are
                    removal instructions at the bottom of every such notification message. You can delete
                    your saved searches to stop receiving the notifications by going to <a href="../MySite/MySummary.aspx">
                        My GunBroker</a> then clicking <a href="../MySite/MyAuctions/Searches.aspx">Saved
                            Searches</a>. Removal instructions appear on that page.</p>
                <p>
                    3. Opt-in newsletters and promotional email messages are mailing lists that you
                    choose to subscribe to during auction registration or by using various opt-in pages
                    or forms on this site. All such lists are 100% opt-in; in other words you will never
                    receive any newsletter or promotional email from this site unless you have specifically
                    elected to be on the applicable email list. You may opt out of these mailings at
                    any time and we have made it very easy to do so. To opt out of future newsletter
                    or promotional email <a href="../MySite/MyAccount/Preferences.aspx">click here</a>
                    and follow the instructions on the subsequent pages.</p>
