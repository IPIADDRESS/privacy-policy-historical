gURL .com is owned by iTurf inc. <br>
gURL .com is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We sometimes collect personal information from our users. This web page explains what information we collect, why we collect it, what we do with it and what you can do about it.

<font face="courier" size="5"><b>Collection of Personal Information</b></font><br>
gURL .com maintains the confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information that we obtain from our users. We do not disclose personal information to any outside party.

<font face="courier" size="5"><b>About IP Addresses</b></font><br>

gURL .com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report anonymous aggregate information to third parties. An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve" up Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When guests request pages from gURL .com, our servers log the users' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. 
<p></p>

These other sites may send their own cookies to users, or otherwise collect data or solicit personal information. Always be aware of where you end up on the Web. 
<p></p>


<font face="courier" size="5"><b>Security</b></font><br>
The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of our users' financial information from their computers to our servers, utilizing encryption software. Only those employees who need access to our users' information in order to do their jobs are allowed access.
