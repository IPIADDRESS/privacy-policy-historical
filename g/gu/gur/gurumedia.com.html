                    <p>PRIVACY POLICY OF Guru Media Int Ltd</p>
<p>Including all Related Websites Owned or Registered to Guru Media Int Ltd<br>
Agreement to Access the Site:</p>
<p>Guru Media Int Ltd, (“GuruMedia”), Limited Company is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains the data collection and use practices of GuruMedia and all related websites owned or registered to GuruMedia. It does not apply to any third party websites, applications, products or services for which GuruMedia is not responsible.</p>
<p>Gurumedia does its data tracking through Sitescout – privacy terms can be found here. <a href="http://www.sitescout.com/privacy/" target="_blank">http://www.sitescout.com/<wbr>privacy/</a></p>
<p>By accessing this site, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this policy as well as the Acceptable Use Policy and the site’s Publisher Terms and Conditions and Advertiser Terms and Conditions. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, THE ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS PROVIDED ON THIS SITE, PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO GuruMedia OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEBSITES REFERRED TO IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.<br>
Changes to Privacy Policy:</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy changes from time to time and changes are effective upon posting. It is your sole responsibility to periodically review this policy for updates and you are solely responsible to be aware of any changes to this and all posted policies on this website. GuruMedia does not provide notices of any changes in any manner other than by posting the changes at this website.<br>
Information Collection, Use, and Dissemination practices:</p>
<p>This policy applies to GuruMedia’s collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by GuruMedia on its, (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the “Websites”), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to GuruMedia’s other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties, or the use of customer lists from third parties. GuruMedia is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third party websites or applications.<br>
1. Collection of Information.<br>
1.1. User Direct Information:</p>
<p>Each time you provide information to take advantage of a promotional offer, enter to win a contest, enter to win a sweepstake, send us an email, or otherwise transmit information via the site, GuruMedia may obtain and collect personally identifiable information provided by you, including, but not limited to, your name, email address, mailing address, social security number, credit card information, and telephone number. You may also provide us with information that, when combined with personally identifiable information, provides us with a better idea of who you are, including but not limited to your gender, birthday, marital status, and education level (collectively referred to as “personal information”). If you choose to access our website, use our services or purchase our products, we may require you to provide personal information as indicated on the forms throughout the site.<br>
1.2. Survey Information:</p>
<p>GuruMedia collects information from you when you voluntarily complete a GuruMedia survey, order form, or a registration page either online by using the internet, offline by providing this information through the mail, in person or using a telephone. This information may be collected by surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties. This method of collection is collectively known as a “Survey.” In such Surveys, GuruMedia or a third party may ask you to provide personal identifiable information including your name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time. GuruMedia may also collect such information concerning you from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this website. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and you are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to GuruMedia or a third party, but you may receive incentives from GuruMedia or a third party in exchange for providing such information.<br>
1.3. Third Party List Information:</p>
<p>GuruMedia may collect information from you when you provide information to a third party and GuruMedia subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third party. Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the third party. When acquiring this information, GuruMedia seeks assurances from the third party that it has a right to transfer the information to GuruMedia and that the third party has a right to provide offers from advertisers to you included on the third party list.<br>
1.4. Other Methods of Collecting Personal Information:</p>
<p>Other occasions when GuruMedia obtains information from you include (1) your claiming a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by GuruMedia or by a third party, (2) your requests for assistance through GuruMedia’s customer service department, and (3) when you voluntarily subscribe to a GuruMedia service or newsletter.<br>
1.5. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology:</p>
<p>GuruMedia currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you with information about you in its database. Additionally, GuruMedia may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future. (a) Cookies: “Cookies” are a feature on your browser software. If enabled, we may write cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this Site. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; save your password for ease of access to our Site. You can disable cookies, although the Site may not function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be modified to accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use all of the features and functionality of GuruMedia’s websites, you need to accept cookies. (b) Web Beacons: A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows GuruMedia to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine products or services you may be interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, GuruMedia also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in GuruMedia’s database. (c) IP Addresses: GuruMedia automatically tracks certain information based upon your behavior on the site. We may use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) is a unique Internet “address” which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider (“ISP”). For local area network (“LAN”), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information about a user’s traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages. (d) Computer Profiles: GuruMedia may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For instance, GuruMedia may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal Identification Information, we are able to use such visitor data to identify you. (e) Data Mining: Data Mining technology may be employed from time to time if used by a Client of GuruMedia. (f) New Technology: The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly developing. As a result, GuruMedia strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of new technology.<br>
1.6. No Information Collected from Children:</p>
<p>GuruMedia will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 18. If GuruMedia obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 18, that information will be immediately deleted from its database. Because it does not collect such information, GuruMedia has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. GuruMedia has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).<br>
1.7. Credit Card Information:</p>
<p>GuruMedia may, in certain instances, collect credit card numbers and related information when an individual places an order from GuruMedia. When the credit card information is submitted to GuruMedia, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. GuruMedia will use the credit card information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the credit card information will be disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.<br>
