<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>--Updated February 28, 2005</p>
<p>The Guttmacher Institute has created this privacy statement to demonstrate the Institute's commitment to protecting personal information gathered in the course of visits to this Web site. </p>
<h2>PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</h2>
<p>You do not have to provide personally identifying information to visit our site. If you choose not to provide personal information when prompted, you can still visit most of our web pages pages.  </p>
<p>We may collect personally identifiable information (name, email address, physical address and other unique identifiers) only if specifically and knowingly provided by you. Personally identifying information collected will be used only in connection with our Web site, or for such purposes as are described at the point of collection, (e.g. purchase transactions, requests for printed materials, list serve signup, requests for download permission of selected online content.) Personally identifying information may also be used to gather broad demographic information about our user community and/or to perform analyses of user behavior in order to measure visitor interest in specific areas of the Web site.   </p>
<p>In no case will anyone's email address be shared (disclosed, given, sold or traded) with any third party. In no case will anyone's personal information be shared (disclosed, given, sold or traded) with any third party other than Guttmacher's agents (such as a credit card processor) without the user's explicit permission.</p>
<h2>COOKIES</h2>
<p>This Web site uses cookies in three ways.</p>
<p>The web server generates a session ID cookie for the purpose of generating usage statistics. This cookie is not associated with any user profiles and expires after one month. </p>
<p>The Guttmacher Institute shopping cart uses a cookie to keep track of items and quantities in the users shopping cart. This cookie expires when the order is successfully completed, the shopping cart is emptied, or--if neither of the former occur--in one week. </p>
<p>In some cases a user ID cookie is issued for users who have registered to access certain resources, so that they are not prompted to re-register on subsequent visits.  </p>
<h2>OPT-IN POLICY</h2>
<p>The Guttmacher Institute follows a strict opt-in policy; that is, you must affirmatively choose to receive information from the Institute, and list serve subscribers always have the option of discontinuing further communication by clicking on the "Manage your subscription" link at the bottom of a message.</p>
<h2>EMAIL LISTS - PRACTICES AND POLICIES</h2>
<p>The Guttmacher Institute uses Intellicontact Pro, a permission-based email messaging service provider, to administer its multiple email lists. iContact is a product of the Broadwick Corporation of Chapel Hill, NC. For more information on the Broadwick Corporation and iContact visit <a href="http://www.icontact.com">http://www.icontact.com/</a>. </p>
<p>Iicontact Pro includes reporting and tracking features that allow the Guttmacher Institute to monitor the effectiveness of its online communication efforts. iContact's MessageStats software records and reports the number of recipients who opened a message and the email addresses of those recipients. (Note: the Guttmacher Institute holds no information other than an email address for its email list subscribers. Name, contact information and/or affiliation are not required during subscription opt-in). MessageStats records the number of click-throughs on each link within a message as well as the number of times the email message was forwarded by a recipient. It also records the email addresses of the "forward to" recipients. the Guttmacher Institute will not access the "forward to" information. </p>
<p>Consistent with Guttmacher Institute's overall privacy policy, the email addresses of subscribers to the lists will not be shared (given, rented, sold or traded) with any third party for that party's use. The Broadwick Corporation warrants the same protection of the email addresses used within its iContact product/service:</p>
<p>"iContact will never share, sell, trade or rent its client's personal account information or its clients' subscriber data without advance permission of the client or unless ordered by a court of law."</p>
<p>"iContact will not send email messages on its own behalf to any of its client's subscriber lists at any time."</p>
<p>Subscribers may remove themselves from any or all Guttmacher Institute email lists at any time by clicking on the "Manage your subscription" link at the bottom of a message.</p>
<p>The Guttmacher Institute is doing its absolute best to protect your privacy while providing you with the most useful and timely information. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, please contact <a href="mailto:info@guttmacher.org">info@guttmacher.org</a>.</p>
<h2>SECURITY</h2>
<p>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All information is backed up daily to prevent loss of data.  </p>
<p>You should be aware that transmissions through the Internet to and from this Web site, including e-mail messages sent to the Guttmacher Institute, are not confidential, and your communications may be read or intercepted. In some instances, including any time you are asked to provide credit card information to order products or make donations through this Web site, information is sent in a commercially secure (encrypted) form, which significantly limits the possibility that this information may be read by others. </p>
<h2>POLICY REVISIONS</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personally identifiable information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our web site.
