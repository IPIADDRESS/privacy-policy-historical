please go <a href="http://www.keenspot.com/privacy.html">here</a>.</center><p>

We here at <b>GPF</b> always have and always will respect the privacy of our visitors. 
In fact, we're probably just as nuts (or more so) about online privacy as you are. 
<b>GPF</b> has never collected and sold private information for any purpose, and you 
have our solemn oath that we never will. All forms on this site do exactly what they 
say they do, and we try our best to spell out all the details before you even get to 
them.</p><p>

From time to time, we conduct polls of our readers, which are totally anonymous. The 
questions may contain some demographic information, such as gender, age, general world 
location, how often you read the strip, etc. All information collected by these surveys 
is purely voluntary, stored securely on our server, and used solely for making 
this site as good as it can be. We will never sell or otherwise distribute this 
information outside our control. We will never collect information without your 
knowledge, except for such information about your browser or operating system that can 
be easily obtained through ordinary queries. (Such information is commonly returned by 
your browser automatically, and is in no way connected to you personally.)</p><p>

In the event we may run future contests, we may require you to enter small amounts of 
personal information, such as your name and e-mail address. We may also attempt to 
brand your browser with a unique "cookie" ID or store your IP address to help prevent 
duplicate entries. When we do this, we promise to tell you up front exactly what's 
going on, and we will never do this without giving you such knowledge first. Any such 
personal information collected by such a contest will be stored securely on our server, 
impossible to access from outside sources, and will be promptly destroyed once the 
contest has been completed. Again, it will never be sold or distributed out of our 
hands.</p><p><br>

</p><center><a name="cookies"><h3>Our Policy on and Use of "Cookies"</h3></a></center>

For the uninitiated, "cookies" are small snippets of text information stored on your 
hard drive, saved by your browser. Cookies have a multitude of uses, usually helping 
maintain state information between pages (such as an online shopping cart system, or 
perhaps a <a href="games/gandalf/">game</a>). Cookies can and have been used by others 
for malicious purposes; please rest assured that we here at <b>GPF</b> will never use 
cookies in such a manner.<p>

As a general rule, this site does not use cookies for your basic <b>GPF</b> experience 
(the comic, archives, most fun extras). Our web server may attempt to attach a cookie 
to your browser on your first visit, but this action is beyond our control and we 
cannot turn it off. (Subsequently, we will never use this particular cookie for any 
purpose, either.) Some of our <a href="games/">Geeky Games</a> may use cookies to 
maintain state information, and we may use cookies to help identify your browser in 
the case of a contest, as mentioned above. Our <a href="archive/">Archives</a> have a 
voluntary bookmark feature that also uses a cookie to keep track of where you left off. 
These cookies will never be set without your knowledge; we will always tell you up 
front what's going on before it happens, so you can elect not to participate in or use 
these features if you feel uncomfortable. In most cases, we will also provide some 
method of destroying the cookie and thus "unbranding" your browser if the feature is 
no longer needed or desired.</p><p>

We cannot be held responsible for any use of cookies, legitimate or otherwise, made by 
our advertisers.</p><p><br>

</p><center><a name="adinfo"><h3>Advertiser Information</h3></a></center>

To help keep our site free and open to everyone, we have elected to display banner 
advertising on most of our pages. In return for displaying their ads, we receive 
monetary compensation. Not much, but it's more than nothing. We have little to no 
control over the content of these banner ads, where they may lead, and the contents of 
the sites they may lead to. As such, we cannot be held responsible for any offensive 
or malicious content that may appear on these ads or their feature sites. If you do 
find any offensive, malicious, or illegal material in such a banner ad, please 
<a href="mailto:jeff@gpf-comics.com?subject=Bad Advertiser!">send us an e-mail</a> 
so we can investigate.<p>

There is always the possibility that banner ads may include JavaScript and/or Java, or 
may attempt to set a "cookie." All such code is completely out of our control, and we 
cannot be held responsible for any such code that may affect your browser in any 
fashion. (Some banner ads have been known to crash browsers, much to our dismay.) 
We also cannot be held responsible if one of these advertisers attempts to collect your 
personal information through a banner ad; we personally find such an act to be 
unscrupulous and devious, but there's little we can do about it, if it occurs. If you 
believe your personal information is being spirited away by such an ad, please 
<a href="mailto:jeff@gpf-comics.com?subject=Bad Advertiser!">send us an e-mail</a> 
so we can investigate.</p><p>

There have been, in some cases, advertisers who have displayed ads on our site that 
represent or promote ideas, products, or services that are neither endorsed nor 
supported by the <b>GPF</b> team. In fact, we have even noticed an ad or two that 
directly contradicts our personal views and beliefs. In no way, shape, or form should 
it be mistaken that display of any banner ad on the <b>GPF</b> site implies our support 
or endorsement of the products, services, or ideas represented by any ad. We cannot 
vouch for any advertiser, aside from the fact that they pay us to display their ads. 
If you choose to use an advertiser's product or service based upon seeing their ad here 
on <b>GPF</b>, you do so at your own risk.</p><p>

Each advertiser usually maintains their own privacy policies and procedures. For your 
convenience, we've included links to their privacy pages here:</p><p>

</p><center><a name="optout"><h3>Sonar/DoubleClick "Opt Out"</h3></a></center>

Many of you may already be aware that <a href="http://www.sonar.com/">Sonar</a> and 
its parent company, <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/">DoubleClick</a>, have been 
the center of some debate concerning online privacy. To summarize, DoubleClick merged 
with another company which specialized in maintaining large marketing databases 
containing the names, addresses, and other contact information for many, many 
consumers. DoubleClick announced their plans to connect their current Web surfing 
tracking database with this marketing database, a move which, in short, would enable 
them to connect 
an individual's Web surfing habits with their personal contact information. Up until 
this announcement, Web surfing has largely been an anonymous activity. Many privacy 
advocates cried foul over the announcement and, under a great deal of pressure from the 
Internet community, DoubleClick backed down and promised not to pursue this activity... 
<i>for the time being.</i><p>

Under this pressure, DoubleClick also created an "opt out" system, which effectively 
disables their ability to track a Web surfer's movements. Their advertising system 
"brands" visitors through advertising code with an individual and unique "cookie," 
which can then be followed across any site displaying DoubleClick ads, and thus feeding 
their browsing habits to DoubleClick. The "opt out" system disables this cookie, 
crippling the tracking system and removing any personalization involved.</p><p>

We here at <b>GPF</b> personally feel that DoubleClick's actions in attempting to link 
personal contact information with Web surfing habits is dubious at best, sinister at 
worst. We feel that your right to freedom is important, and that your privacy should be 
cherished and protected. As such, we would like to offer you the opportunity to join 
us in "opting out" of DoubleClick's tracking system and returning anonymity to your 
Web surfing enjoyment. To activate the "opt out," simply follow the link below and 
follow the page's instructions.</p><p>
