          <p>Our Commitment To Privacy</p>
        </h3>
        <p class="style1">Your privacy is important to us. </p>
        <p class="style1">To better protect your privacy, we've   developed this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy covers the collection and use   of personal information, such as your name, address, email, credit card   information, and billing information (“Personal Information”), that may be   collected by GKBusiness anytime you interact with us, such as when you search   for information on any of our websites, purchase our advertising services, join   our publisher network, or call our customer service associates (collectively,   GKBusiness’ “Services”). </p>
        <p class="style1">This Privacy Policy describes our information   practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information   is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we   safeguard your Personal Information. It also describes the choices available to   you regarding GKBusiness’s use of your Personal Information and the steps you   can take to access this information and to request that we correct or delete   it. </p>
        <p class="style1">Your continued participation on the GKBusiness Services indicates your   acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure,   management and storage of your Personal Information as described below. This   Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect (with such changes as we may   make to this Privacy Policy) as long as you are a user of the GKBusiness   Services, even if your use of or participation in any particular Service   expires, ceases, or is suspended or deactivated for any reason.</p>

        <h3 class="style1">Why We Collect Personal Information</h3>
        <p class="style1">We collect Personal Information to help us deliver a superior level of   service. It enables us to give you convenient access to our search services,   advertising services and publisher services, and helps us keep you updated on   special offers, news, and the latest information on GKBusiness products and   services that you might like to hear about.</p>
        <h3 class="style1">Information We Collect &amp; How We Use It&nbsp;</h3>
        <p class="style1">There are a number of situations in which your Personal Information may help   us give you better service.</p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>Information Automatically Collected by our Website</strong></p>
        <p class="style1">Like many websites, we collect and analyze certain user behavior on our   website and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol   (IP) addresses, browser type, referring/exit pages, the date &amp; time, and   search queries. We also collect information regarding user activities on our   website. We use this information to analyze website traffic, improve the   performance of our search Services, improve our geo-targeted advertising   services, administer the website and prevent fraud. This helps us to determine   how best to provide useful information to users and to understand which parts of   our website and Services are of most interest to them.</p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong></p>
        <p class="style1">We track user behavior and use of our Services through the use of cookies and   web beacons. A “cookie” is a small text file that a website can place on your   computer's hard drive in order, for example, to collect information about your   activities on the website or to make it easier to use certain website functions.   The cookie transmits this information back to the website's computer. Many users   do not know that “cookies” are being placed on their computers when they visit a   website. If you want to know when this happens, or prevent it from happening,   you can set your browser to warn you when a website attempts to place a “cookie”   on your computer.</p>
        <p class="style1">We use cookies to improve the quality of our Service by storing user   preferences and tracking user trends, such as how people search and which   advertisements they click on. We use both session ID cookies and persistent   cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent   cookie remains on your computer for an extended period of time. You can remove   persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's   “help” file.</p>
        <p class="style1">We use cookies on our website to provide our Service, including without   limitation, in the following ways:</p>
        <p class="style1">When you initially REGISTER AS A CUSTOMER OR DISTRIBUTION PARTNER OF   GKBusiness , we use a cookie to remember your user preferences. If you have   checked the “Remember me” checkbox and you have identified yourself, the cookie   allows you to skip having to identify yourself again. Please do not check the   “Remember me” box if you are using a shared computer.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="style1">We use cookies to track when a search user clicks on a sponsored listing, and   in some cases we use cookies and web beacons to determine whether the click   resulted in an actual purchase of products or services from the advertiser’s   site. This information is used to determine the effectiveness of our advertising   Services. <br>
          We also use cookies to analyze how visitors, in the aggregate, use   our website, in order to make our website as useful as possible for them. We do   not use cookies to collect or store personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="style1">Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your   browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.   However, some of our Services may not function properly if your cookies are   disabled.</p>
        <p class="style1">We also use web beacons (a small transparent image, iframe, script, object or   other transparent tag embedded in a web page) on some of our web pages and   advertising Services. Whenever the user opens the page with a browser, the web   beacon or tag is requested from the server storing it, allowing the server to   take notice of the download. As a result, our servers (or our website analytics   company’s servers) are informed of when the web page has been viewed.</p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>Customer Information</strong></p>
        <p class="style1">If you register to become an advertising customer or distribution partner of   GKBusiness, we will use the personally identifying information you provide (your   company name, billing information and contact information) to contact you about   your account when necessary. We use this information only for billing purposes,   to fill your orders, and to deliver the services you have requested. If we have   trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.</p>
        <p class="style1">In some of our email messages, web pages and search results we use a   “click-through URL” linked to content on the GKBusiness website. When a   recipient clicks one of these URLs, they pass through a web server before   arriving at the destination webpage. We track this click-through data to help us   determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our   customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking   text or graphic links in the email.</p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>Contact Us</strong></p>
        <p class="style1">If you provide Personal Information to us by sending us email, letters or   faxes or by calling us, we will use that information to respond to your question   or request for information. We may ask for your Personal Information when you’re   discussing a service issue on the phone with a customer services associate,   registering to become a customer, participating in an online survey, or   purchasing our products and services. At such times, we may collect Personal   Information relevant to the situation, such as your name, email address, phone   number, and contact preferences; your credit card information; and information   relating to a support or service issue.</p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>Surveys</strong></p>
        <p class="style1">We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys. If   you participate, we may request certain Personal Information from you.   Participation in these contests or surveys is completely voluntary and you   therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The   requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and   email address), and demographic information (such as zip code). We use the   survey data to improve our Services, and may publicize the results as a public   service. The publicized results will not include any personally identifiable   information without your consent.</p>
        <p class="style1">We may use a third party service provider to conduct these contests or   surveys. While this third party will have access to your Personal Information,   it will be subject to confidentiality and only as necessary to conduct the   services we have requested from them. We will not share the personally   identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other   third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>
        <h3 class="style1">When We Share Your Personal Information</h3>
        <p class="style1">We do not sell or barter your contact or Personal Information to anyone.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="style1">There are times when GKBusiness makes certain Personal Information about you   available to companies that GKBusiness has a strategic relationship with or that   perform work for GKBusiness to provide services to you on our behalf. These   companies may help us perform various business functions, including without   limitation, improving the targeting of our advertisements across our network,   fulfilling customer orders, processing payments, managing and enhancing customer   data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our Services, or   conducting surveys. These companies are also obligated to protect your Personal   Information in accordance with applicable law. Without such information being   made available, it would be difficult for you to use our Services, receive   customer service, provide us feedback to improve our Services, or access certain   of our Services; and it would be difficult for us to continue improving our   search and advertising Services.</p>
        <p class="style1">We will also share your Personal Information if we have a good faith belief   that we are required to do so by law, that doing so is necessary to cooperate   with law enforcement agencies, comply with warrants or subpoenas served on   GKBusiness, enforce the Terms &amp; Conditions, detect fraud, or otherwise   protect the rights of GKBusiness, its employees and users of the Services.</p>
        <h3 class="style1">How We Protect &amp; Secure Your Personal Information</h3>
        <p class="style1">We take administrative, electronic, technical, and physical precautions to   safeguard and secure your Personal Information against loss, theft, and misuse,   as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
        <p class="style1">The GKBusiness Site uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all   webpages where Personal Information is required, including but not limited to,   our publisher and advertiser account pages. We also follow industry standards to   provide security for your sensitive information once we receive it.</p>
        <p class="style1">You can help protect your Personal Information by also taking precautions to   protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords   often using a combination of letters and numbers, don’t disclose your account   information or password to anyone else, and make sure you use a secure web   browser.</p>
        <p class="style1">Please be aware, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet,   or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to   use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we   cannot guarantee its absolute security. You should always use caution when   submitting Personal Information online.</p>
        <h3 class="style1">Access To Your Personal Information</h3>
        <p class="style1">We will provide you reasonable access and the ability to correct the Personal   Information you have provided. You can help us ensure that your contact   information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by checking   your online account. If your personally identifiable information changes, or if   you no longer desire our Service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate   it by making the change on your online account or by contacting us.</p>
        <p class="style1">You can also request a copy of your Personal Information and your account   history by contacting us. To protect your privacy and security, we will also   take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making   corrections.</p>
        <h3 class="style1">Links To Other Websites</h3>
        <p class="style1">Our website includes links to thousands of other websites whose privacy   practices may differ from those of GKBusiness. For example, our “People Search”   and “Local Search” Services contain links to online services and provides   contact information for individuals and businesses. GKBusiness does not control   the websites of third parties that are linked from our Services, and is not   responsible for information included in those services. If you submit Personal   Information to any of those websites, your information is subject to their   privacy statements. GKBusiness’s privacy statement applies only to its own   Services, and does not apply to any other website. We encourage you to carefully   read the privacy statement of any website you visit. GKBusiness is not   responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other websites.</p>
        <h3 class="style1">Changes To This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p class="style1">If we change this Privacy Policy in ways that affect the personally   identifying information we have collected through our website, we will post the   updated Privacy Policy on this webpage to advise you of choices you may have as   a result of those changes. Any changes made to this Privacy Policy will go into   effect immediately, so please check back periodically to remain informed as to   changes in the Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h3 class="style1">Privacy Statement Compliance</h3>
        <p class="style1">If you feel that we have not complied with this privacy statement, please   contact us using the information supplied above.&nbsp;</p>
