GQueues is a free, list management application.  At GQueues we recognize that privacy is important. This policy describes the types of personal information we may collect and how we use it to provide the GQueues service.
</p>

<p>
By using GQueues, you agree to the collection and use of your personal information as described in this policy. You should know we collect limited account information and store and maintain your account and list contents on Google's secure servers.  We will never rent, sell or share information that personally identifies you for marketing purposes without your express permission.
</p>

<p>
To comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, at this time GQueues is only available to users who are at least 13 years old. If you are under 13, please do not use the GQueues service.
</p>

<h4>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</h4>
All users of GQueues are required to login using their Google account.  Google has made available certain account information to GQueues for use in the service including your email address.  To modify any of your Google account information, please use the means provided by Google.  GQueues does NOT have access to, nor store your Google account password.

<h5>List contents and usage</h5>
The contents of your GQueues account are stored and maintained on Google servers in order to provide the service.  Because Google keeps back-up copies of data for the purposes of recovery from errors or system failure, residual copies of task list contents may remain on Google systems for some time, even after you have deleted information or after the termination of your account.  
<p>
We also may collect information about the use of your account, such as how much storage you are using, how often you log in and other information related to your registration and use of GQueues. Information displayed or clicked on in your GQueues account (including UI elements, links, and other information) is also recorded. We use this information internally to deliver the best possible service to you, such as improving the GQueues user interface.
</p>
<p>
We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who labeled a queue with a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually.
</p>

<h5>Cookies</h5>
When you visit GQueues, we send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends. GQueues also uses cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. We may set a cookie in your browser when you visit a website and view or click on an ad supported by GQueues' advertising services.  

<h5>Log information</h5>
When you access GQueues services, Google servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

<h5>User communications</h5>
When you send email or other communications to GQueues, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.
