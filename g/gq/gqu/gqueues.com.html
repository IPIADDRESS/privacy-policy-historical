However, certain Information is collected automatically and, if some Information, such as account email, is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services. Other personal information may be withheld, but will result in a degraded user experience.</p>

<p>Information that is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection law is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "<strong>Personal Data</strong>."</p>


<h2 id="controller">Data Controller and Processor</h2>

<p>Data protection law in certain jurisdictions differentiates between the "controller" and "processor" of information. You, the User, are the controller of User Data. GQueues is the processor of User Data and the controller of Other Information.</p>


<h2 id="information">How We Use Information</h2>

<p><strong>User Data</strong>. User Data will be used by GQueues in accordance with User's instructions, including any applicable terms in the Terms of Use, and as required by applicable law. GQueues is a processor of User Data and User is the controller. For example, User may use the Services to share queues with others, assign tasks, modify content or export User Data. GQueues also provides integrations with a number of Google products and services using the Google APIs. GQueues cannot access your data in these services unless you or your G Suite Admin explicitly authorize access. If authorization is granted, GQueues uses its access to your data and these services in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Google Account</strong> (read-only) - GQueues allows you to sign in with your Google Account or G Suite Account. GQueues does NOT have access to, and does NOT store your Google password. GQueues does access your name, email address and profile image to create your GQueues account and identify you within the service. To modify any of your Google account information, please use the means provided by Google.</li>

    <li><strong>Google Calendar</strong> (read/write) - GQueues allows integration with Google Calendar by creating a secondary "GQueues" calendar in your account that displays all of your tasks with due dates, and provides 2-way syncing of data between this "GQueues" calendar and your GQueues account.</li>

    <li><strong>Google Drive</strong> (read/write) - GQueues allows you to attach files in Google Drive to your tasks in GQueues. GQueues also allows you to upload attachments to your tasks and these files are stored in your Google Drive account in a "GQueues Uploads" folder. When you share a queue with others or assign a task, GQueues will automatically share any attached Google Drive files with those users. GQueues also allows you to preview images and audio attachments directly in GQueues.</li>

    <li><strong>Google Contacts</strong> (read-only) - GQueues searches and displays your Google Contacts so that you can easily assign or share tasks with others.</li>

    <li><strong>Gmail</strong> (read-only) - GQueues allows you to create tasks out of emails and attaches a copy of the email to the task for easy reference later.</li>

    <li><strong>Google Tasks</strong> (read-only) - GQueues allows you to perform a one-time import of your data from Google Tasks to GQueues.</li>

    <li><strong>G Suite Directory</strong> (read-only) - GQueues allows G Suite Admins to lookup users on their domain and issue GQueues licenses to them.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Other Information</strong>. GQueues is the controller of Other Information and uses Other Information to operate the Services and further our business interests. Specifically, GQueues uses Other Information:</p>


<ul>
    <li><strong>To provide, support, and improve the Services we offer.</strong> Other Information is used to deliver the Services, address technical issues, enhance security, monitor usage and analyze other user activities within the Services.</li>

    <li><strong>As required by law,</strong> such as to comply with subpoenas, court orders or similar legal processes.</li>

    <li><strong>To communicate with you by responding to your requests and questions.</strong> If you contact us, we may use your Other Information to respond. When you send email or other communications to GQueues, we may retain those communications to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our service.</li>

    <li><strong>To send emails and other communications.</strong> We may send you technical or administrative emails, messages and other types of communications. We may also contact you to inform you about changes in our Services or important Services-related notices, such as security and fraud notices. These communications are considered part of the Services and you may not opt out of them.</li>

    <li><strong>To send you informational and promotional content in accordance with your marketing preferences.</strong> You may choose to stop receiving this content by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, or you can contact us at privacy@gqueues.com.</li>

    <li><strong>For billing, account management and other administrative matters.</strong> GQueues may need to contact you about invoicing, account management and similar reasons and we use account data to administer accounts and keep track of billing and payments.</li>

    <li><strong>To investigate and help prevent security issues and abuse.</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Information that is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, may be used by GQueues for any business purpose.</p>


<h2 id="disclose">How We Share and Disclose Information</h2>

    <li><strong>When Collaborating with Others.</strong> The Services provide a variety of ways for Users to share User Data with others, such as assigning tasks or sharing queues. Other Information may also be shared in these instances, including a User's profile information (email address, name and profile image).</li>

    <li><strong>Using Third Party Service Providers.</strong> We may use third party companies for the purpose of providing the Services and to process Other Information to support our business objectives. These companies are authorized to use your Personal Data only as necessary to provide these services to us. Your Personal Data will not be used for secondary purposes without prior notification and express consent obtained. Additional information about the subprocessors we use is detailed at <a href="https://www.gqueues.com/subprocessors">GQueues Subprocessors</a>.</li>

    <li><strong>During Changes to Our Business.</strong> If GQueues is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, some or all Other Information may be shared or transferred, subject to standard confidentiality arrangements.
