<h4>GSN.COM PRIVACY POLICY</h4>

<h4>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE GSN TERMS OF SERVICE BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE OR ANY GSN FORUM </h4>

<p>This Privacy Policy Statement ("Privacy Policy") is applicable to the Game 
Show Network ("GSN") Website located at  
http://www.gsn.com/ (the "Website"), and all 
services provided thereon ("Services"), including all GSN Forums ( as defined in 
the Terms of Service ) . This Privacy Policy does not cover any interaction you 
may have with GSN by telephone, postal mail, or other offline communications. 
</p>

<h4>Notice </h4>

<p>GSN respects your privacy and is committed to protecting 
personal information that you provide in connection with your use of the 
Website. This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you notice of GSN's 
information practices, including the types of information gathered, how the 
information is used and safeguarded, and how you may control the maintenance and 
sharing of your information. </p>

<h4>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information </h4>

<p>You can visit GSN at any time without providing any information about 
yourself. However, in order to use certain portions of the Services (e.g., to 
play games, access GSN Forums, or use other Services as described in the 
<strong><a href="/cgi/corporate/terms.html?display=">Terms of Service</a> </strong>), 
you may be required to register and create an account with GSN ("GSN Account"). 
</p>

<p>There is no cost to create a GSN Account but you will be asked to choose a 
member name (please do not use your real name or the real name of another 
person) and password, and to provide certain personally identifiable 
information, such as your real name, age, address, telephone number, occupation 
and e-mail address. If you do provide GSN with personally identifiable 
information, we will take all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this 
information. We also urge you to keep your password confidential and refrain 
from sharing it with others. GSN will not disclose, share, sell or rent 
personally identifiable information to any third party without your prior 
consent. </p>

<p>Please note that your member name will be available to the Internet general 
public while you participate in certain GSN Forums such as message boards or 
chat rooms. </p>

<p>Other than registration information, you may be asked to provide certain 
personal information in order to use or participate in certain promotions such 
as giveaways, sweepstakes, contests, surveys, newsletters, etc. ("Special 
Promotions"). In these instances, the Website will contain information regarding 
the intended use of the requested information. </p>

<p>GSN may also use technology, such as cookies (as described below), 
transparent gifs, frames, server log analysis and other technologies as they are 
developed, to enhance your experience on GSN and in the use of GSN Services. 
</p>

<h4>Special Notice Regarding Children Under 13 Years of Age </h4>

<p>GSN respects the privacy of children of all ages. GSN particularly recognizes 
the sensitivity of personal information concerning children under the age of 13 
and therefore provides this special notice to parents and guardians regarding 
the collection and use of information collected from children in this age group. 
</p>

<p>This Website is not directed towards young children. GSN is intent on 
complying with applicable laws and regulations regarding children, including the 
United States ' Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Specifically, GSN will 
not knowingly collect and maintain any personally identifiable information from 
children under 13. Parents are hereby put on notice that as a result of the 
foregoing, GSN does not provide a mechanism to obtain parental consent. </p>

<p>If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child has 
submitted his or her personal information, GSN will make reasonable efforts to 
delete the information from its database, at your request. To request the 
deletion of your child's information, please send an email to <strong><a href="mailto:webmaster@gsn.com">webmaster@gsn.com</a></strong>and be sure 
to include in your message the same member name and password that your child 
submitted. </p>

<h4>Non-Personally Identifiable Information </h4>

<p>As part of the registration process to create a GSN Account or to participate in Special 
Promotions, you may be asked to provide certain information that does not 
personally identify you. For example, you may be asked to provide information 
concerning your television viewing habits, music or other entertainment 
preferences, purchasing habits, and the like. GSN requests this information in 
order to enhance your online experience by understanding you better and to also 
make you aware of new services, programs or offers which may be of interest to 
you. </p>

<p>In general, you can browse GSN while remaining anonymous. However, in many 
cases, if you wish to interact on the Website, GSN will collect certain 
non-personally identifiable information about your use of the Services. For 
example, GSN might collect information concerning the type of Internet browser 
or computer operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet 
service provider, your "click path" through the GSN Website, the Website or 
advertisement from which you linked to the GSN Website, and/or the Website that 
you go to when leaving the GSN Website. In order to do this, GSN may use several 
technologies and perform system checks when a user visits the Website. Examples 
of such technologies are cookies (as described below), transparent gifs, frames, 
server log analysis, and other technologies as they are developed. All 
technologies implemented on the Website are used to enhance the user experience. </p>

<p>GSN uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and transparent GIF files, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy" target="_blank">http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy</a> </p>
<p>As discussed above, in general, GSN uses information to improve and enhance 
the Services. However, from time to time, GSN may share this information with 
other entities in an aggregate, non-personally identifiable form to show general 
demographic and preference information among users of the GSN Website. </p>

<h4>Online Store </h4>

<p>The Website may contain an online store from which you can purchase certain 
products. We will be required to collect personal information such as name, 
contact information, shipping and billing addresses, and a credit card number in 
order to process your order. We may also keep records of your transactions with 
us. We may use the information you provide to us in order to communicate with 
you about products purchased, related customer support and to send you 
information about other products or services we believe may be of interest to 
you. </p>

<h4>Cookies </h4>

<p>When you visit the GSN Website or any advertisements appearing on the 
Website, or use one or more of the Services, we may use an industry-wide 
technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data that a Website can send 
to your browser, which may then store the cookie on your computer if your 
browser is enabled to accept cookies. Transparent gifs assist in the delivery of 
cookies and enable us to enhance your use of the Services. This technology 
allows us to better match your interests and preferences or simply to facilitate 
your signing in to use the Website and its Services. Most Internet browsers will 
allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of 
cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please note, however, 
that if you block cookies, many portions of the Website will not function 
properly. You should refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn 
more about how to manage cookies. </p>

<h4>Use of Information Collected </h4>

<p>Except as specifically outlined in this Privacy Policy, we do not share your 
personal information with non-affiliated third parties without your permission. 
We may disclose aggregated information, such as demographic information, and 
certain statistical analysis to third parties, including advertisers and other 
business partners. This aggregated information will include any personal 
information. We may, however, share your personal information with our owners 
and other affiliated companies, including Sony Pictures Entertainment, Liberty 
Media, and their parents, subsidiaries, or affiliated companies, in order to 
provide portions of the Website and/or Services (e.g., to provide fulfillment 
for prizes won in a GSN sweepstakes or contest), or to provide other support for 
a GSN promotion. Please refer to the individual privacy policies of our 
affiliates for details concerning how they handle your personal and non-personal 
information. </p>

<p>GSN will not disclose your personal information to non-affiliated third 
parties, unless we have previously informed you of the disclosure, have been 
given your consent to disclose, or we are required by law to disclose. In the 
case of Special Promotions, the name of any third parties involved in the 
promotion will be disclosed, and when applicable, you may be given the option of 
providing your information to them. We reserve the right to disclose 
non-personal information in any way we deem appropriate. </p>

<p>GSN uses third party vendors to provide portions of the Website and its 
Services. By using the Services, you are deemed to consent to the use of these 
vendors. These vendors are contractually restricted to using personal 
information for the sole purpose of providing the Services and are strictly 
prohibited from sharing, selling, or otherwise distributing any personal data of 
our customers. </p>

<p>As stated in the Terms of Service, you will be deemed to have consented to 
the transfer and/or disclosure to a subsequent owner of this Website, of any 
personal information submitted by you and contained in GSN's database if GSN 
assigns all of its rights and obligations regarding the use of your personal 
information at the time of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or 
substantially all of GSN's assets. </p>

<p>Third-party advertisers may deliver specific advertisements to you on the 
Website. Such advertisers may collect non-personal information about your visits 
to the Website and other websites in order to provide advertisements about 
products and services that may be of interest to you. These companies may also 
aggregate your non-personal information for use in targeted advertising, 
marketing research and other similar purposes. These companies may also place 
their own cookies on your computer. For a list of these commercial and advertising agencies and their privacy policies, as well as more information about your option not to accept cookies or clear gifs placed by these companies, please the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a> website. You can also visit each third-party advertiser's applicable website directly in order to opt-out from their use of this information.</p>

<h4>Our Commitment to Data Security </h4>

<p>If you give GSN sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers), GSN will 
take all commercially reasonable steps to protect such information by 
establishing a secure connection with your Web browser. GSN employs a security 
technology known as a secure-socket-layer ("SSL") to protect the transmission of 
payment information to the Website. Unless otherwise specified herein or on the 
Website, credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not 
retained for marketing or any other purposes. </p>

<p>While GSN takes precautions against possible breaches in its databases, no 
Website or internet transmission or connection is completely secure. 
Consequently, GSN cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, 
or other breaches will never occur. </p>

<p>GSN urges you to keep your personal information safe by memorizing your 
password or keeping it in a safe place, separate from your account information, 
as sharing your password with others may lead to unauthorized access to your 
information. </p>

<h4>Postings to GSN Forums </h4>

<p>All postings, whether in a chat room, on message boards or other method of 
communication within the Forums will generally be available to, and freely 
accessible by, other users of the GSN Forums as well as the Internet general 
public. Therefore, users should not expect that any information they post will 
be kept private or confidential and are encouraged to exercise discretion when 
using the GSN Forums. Additionally, your member name will always be included in 
conjunction with your postings in the GSN Forums. GSN is not responsible for 
events arising from the distribution of any information you choose to publicly 
post or share through the Forums. </p>

<h4>Hyperlinks To and From Other Websites </h4>

<p>The Website may contain links to, or advertisements concerning, other 
websites. Other websites may also reference, advertise, or link to GSN. GSN is 
not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites 
and expressly disclaims all liability associated with your use of, and the 
content on, such other websites and advertisements. You should check the 
applicable privacy policy of any website you may click through to. </p>

<h4>Consent to Processing in the United States</h4>

<p>By providing any personal information to the Website, all users, including, 
without limitation, users in the member states of the European Union, fully 
understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such 
information in the United States of America . </p>

<h4>Maintaining and Updating Your Account Information</h4>

<p>As part of your use of the Services, you are responsible for maintaining and 
updating, as applicable, your Registration Information with current and complete 
information. You may edit and delete portions of your GSN Account information or 
delete the GSN Account entirely. To do this, visit the first page after signing 
in to your account, and click on <strong>"Your GSN" </strong>to make changes or 
deletions. You can also write to us at: </p>

<p>GSN<br>Attn: Internet Privacy Policy Dept./Online Entertainment<br>2150 
Colorado Avenue<br>Santa Monica , CA 90404 </p>

<p>After receiving any requested changes to your information, we will make 
reasonable efforts to ensure that all of your person information stored in 
databases we actively use to operate the Website will be updated, corrected, 
changes or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as reasonably practicable. However, 
we reserve the right to retain in our archival files any information we remove 
from or change in our active website databases. We may retain such information 
to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Service. In 
addition, it may not be technologically possible to remove every record of the 
information you have previously provided us, as a copy may exist in a 
non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. </p>
<p>If you are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13, and you 
have discovered that your child created an account and would like to have it 
deleted, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:GSNprivacy@gsn.com">mailto:GSNprivacy@gsn.com</a>with your child's 
member name and password. </p>

comments and questions on this Privacy Policy. You may e-mail us at the 
following address: </p>

<h4>Notification of Changes </h4>

registered guests via email of the existence of a new Privacy Policy and posting 
it on the Website. Any changes to the Privacy Policy shall be effective when 
posted. </p>
