            <strong>Sharing of information<br></strong> Your data may be passed to third party companies who provide training courses, mailing services and event management on behalf of GSMA. In addition, we may pass your information to our related companies [The GSM Association and its affiliated companies], carefully selected business partners or other carefully selected third parties who may contact you to provide you with information, including marketing information in relation to upcoming industry events, meetings, conferences, seminars, offers, products or services which could be of interest to you or your business and/or to carry out surveys and to get your views in relation to the products or services which third parties provide.

These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA. If we transfer your information outside of the EEA in this way, we will take steps aiming to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.
