<p><b><a name="CookiesandOtherTrackingTechnologies"></a>6. COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES<b></b></b></p>
<p>Like many websites, we use tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. We may also use these technologies to, when applicable, record your preferences, track your use of the Site across multiple devices, measure exposure to our online advertisements, monitor traffic, analyze use of the Site, for security purposes, to display information more effectively, to personalize a user’s experience, and to improve the Site and make the Site easier to use.</p>
<p>You have choices to limit some tracking mechanisms that collect information when you use the Site. Many web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser’s setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, certain features of the Site may not function properly or may not remain accessible to you. In addition, you may also render some web beacons unusable by rejecting or removing their associated cookies. Note that, if you choose to remove cookies, you may remove opt-out cookies that affect your advertising preferences.</p>
<p>For more information about your choices, see <i>Interest-Based Advertising</i> below.</p>
<p><b><i>Cookies</i></b></p>
<p>Cookies are small text files that may be placed on your device when you visit the Site or when you view advertisements that we have placed on other websites. Cookies allow your browser to remember some specific information which the web server can later retrieve and use. &nbsp;When you quit your browser, some cookies are stored in your computer’s memory, while some expire or disappear.</p>
<p><b><i>Tags, Pixels, Web Beacons, Clear GIFs</i></b></p>
<p>A web beacon, also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is typically a one-pixel, transparent image located on a webpage or in an email. &nbsp;These may be used when you are served with advertisements, when you interact with advertisements outside of our online services or when you interact with our communications. &nbsp;They are generally used to transmit information back to a web server. &nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Interest-Based Advertising</i></b></p>
<p>Interest-based advertising refers to collecting information about your online activities over time and across different websites, devices, and other online services to deliver advertisements to users of that device based on their web-viewing behavior. We use interest-based advertising to deliver advertisements and other targeted content to you. To facilitate interest-based advertising, we partner with third-party advertising companies who also use these tracking tools to provide advertisements on the Site or other websites. These third parties may use these technologies to collect information about you when you use the Site and your other online activities. They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may also use persistent identifiers to track your Internet usage across other websites and devices in their networks beyond the Site. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based advertising or other targeted content.</p>
<p>We, and many of the third-party advertisers that place tracking tools on the Site, are members of the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s <i>Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising</i>. &nbsp;Some of our ads that are displayed on third-party websites will feature an Ad-Choices icon inside the ad. &nbsp;Clicking on the AdChoices icon inside the ad will provide you with an opportunity to opt out of interest-based advertising by the third parties that participate in the program. In addition, you can learn more about the options available to limit these third parties’ collection and use of your information by visiting our&nbsp;<a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?pid=gs01&amp;aid=gs01&amp;type=marcusbygs" target="_blank">opt-out page</a>&nbsp;and the websites for the&nbsp;<a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://youradchoices.com/aboutus.aspx" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>, as well as the webpages for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/about" target="_blank">Facebook’s ad preferences&nbsp;tool</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p>If you choose to opt-out, a cookie will be placed on your browser or device indicating your decision. This cookie is specific to a particular device and browser, so if you use different browsers or devices, you will need to opt-out on each. In addition, because the opt-out is facilitated via cookies, if you clear your cookies you will need to opt-out again.</p>
<p><b><i>Additional Technology</i></b><i></i></p>
<p>We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“<b>Google</b>”), on the Site.

Any request to be placed on our internally-maintained do not call list will be processed within a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 30 days. GS Bank employees involved in GS Bank's telemarketing campaigns receive training on how to use our internally-maintained do not call list, and how to document, process and honor requests to be placed on our internally-maintained do not call list. It is our policy to honor a do not call request for five (5) years from the time the request is made. However, some states have do not call laws that require us to honor such a request for a longer period of time, and it is our policy to comply with those laws when applicable. Subject to applicable law, if you communicate with us by telephone, we may monitor or record the call. We reserve the right to revise this&nbsp;Do Not Call Policy.</p>
