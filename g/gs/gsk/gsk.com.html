				<p></p><h1>GlaxoSmithKline internet privacy statement</h1>

					GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) respects the privacy
					 of visitors to its web sites and is committed to the protection of their
					 personal information. This privacy statement explains data collection
					 and use practices of the GlaxoSmithKline site (the “Site”).
					 <p></p>
					 <p><strong>Binding Nature</strong><br>
					 By accessing and using the Site, you agree and consent to the collection,
					 use and disclosure of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy
					 Statement. </p>
					 <p><strong>Description of the information GSK may collect
					 </strong></p>
					 <p><strong>1. Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
					 GSK collects personally identifiable information (i.e. information from
					 which you can be identified, such as name, address, telephone number or
					 e-mail address) only when it is asked for and/or you voluntarily submit
					 it to us on this Site. We may use the information to respond to your requests,
					 improve our level of service and the content of our web site; provide
					 you with tips, helpful information, product news and updates; notify you
					 of new GSK products and services; seek your views on our products and
					 services; and for our own internal purposes. <br><br>
					 This Site is not intended or designed to attract children under the age
					 of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information
					 via this Site from visitors in that age group without the explicit consent
					 of a parent or guardian. </p>
					 <p><strong>2. Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
					 GSK also collects non-personally identifiable information in aggregate
					 form to track data such as the total number of visits to our web sites,
					 the number of visitors to each page of our web sites, and the domain names
					 of our visitors' internet service providers. We use this information,
					 which remains in aggregate form, to understand how our visitors use our
					 web sites so that we may improve them and the services we offer. We may
					 also share this information with other companies within the GlaxoSmithKine
					 group and with other third parties. NO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
					 IS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROCESS. </p>
					 <p><strong>Use of IP Addresses</strong> <br>
					 An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a set of numbers that is automatically
					 assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your internet service
					 provider or through your organisation's local area network (LAN) or wide
					 area network (WAN). Web servers automatically identify your computer by
					 the IP address assigned to it during your session online. </p>
					 <p>GSK, or third party companies acting on behalf of GSK, may collect IP
					 addresses for the purposes of systems administration and to audit the
					 use of our site. We do not ordinarily link a user's IP address to personally
					 identifiable information of that user, which means each user's session
					 will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. However, we may
					 use IP addresses to identify users of our site when we feel it is necessary
					 to enforce compliance with the site's terms of use, or to protect our
					 service, site or other users. </p>
					 <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
					 This Site uses a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a
					 small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server.
					 Cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site or help us analyse
					 usage of the Site more accurately. For instance, our server may set a
					 cookie that keeps you from having to enter a password more than once during
					 a visit to the Site. In all cases in which cookies are used, we will not
					 collect personally identifiable information without your explicit permission.
					 The only personally identifiable information GSK collects is the information
					 you voluntarily provide.</p>
					 <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web Browsers
					 automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
					 setting to decline cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored,
					 if you prefer. Please refer to your Internet Browser’s instructions
					 or help screen to learn more about these functions. If you choose to decline
					 cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features
					 of this Site or any other web sites that you visit.</p>
					 <p>If you wish to disable GSK’s ability to track your website interactions,
					 you have the ability to Opt-out of our third party tracking software.
					 Visit <a href="http://www.omniture.com/privacy/optout.html?return_url=&amp;javascript_enabled=true" target="_top">http://www.omniture.com/privacy/optout.html?return_url=&amp;javascript_enabled=true</a>
					 and follow the Opt-Out Policy Instructions. The opt out process will require
					 that you permit the placement of a cookie on your computer that indicates
					 that you do not wish to be tracked by GSK. In the event you remove your
					 cookies from your computer, tracking will resume. </p>
					 <p><strong>How we protect your personal information</strong><br>
					 GSK is committed to protecting the security of your personal information.
					 GSK uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect
					 your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
					 For example, we store the personal information you provide to GSK on computer
					 servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities.
					 While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will
					 not occur, we make every commercially reasonable effort to prevent such
					 unfortunate occurrences. </p>
					 <p><strong>Sharing Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties</strong><br>
					 GSK will not sell or rent personally identifiable information to any third
					 party for any purpose. Sometimes selected third parties are however used
					 to provide GSK with support services in connection with its web sites
					 and such parties may, from time to time, have access to your information
					 to enable them to provide those services to GSK. Please rest assured that
					 all companies providing such support services are required by GSK to meet
					 the same standards of data protection as GSK and are prohibited from using
					 the information for their own marketing purposes.</p>
					 <p>In certain special cases, we may disclose your personally identifiable
					 information in the following circumstances:</p>

							<ol style="padding-left:20px;padding-bottom:5px;">
								<li>when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information
								is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone
								who may be causing injury to you, or otherwise injuring or interfering
								with GSK's rights, property or operations, other users of this site,
								or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities; or 
								</li>
								<li> when we believe the law requires it, or in response to any demand
								by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation,
								or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending
								civil case or administrative investigation. 
								</li>
							</ol>
					 <p>Personal information collected on the Site may be stored and processed
					 in your country of residence or any other country in which GSK or its
					 affiliates, subcontractors or agents maintain facilities, and by using
					 the Site, you consent to any transfer of information outside of your country
					 of residence. GSK will ensure that if information is transferred outside
					 your country of residence, it will still be treated in accordance with
					 this privacy statement.</p>
					 <p><strong>Links to Other Web Sites</strong><br>
					 This Site may provide links to other GSK and third party web sites as
					 a service to our users. The privacy statement described here does not
					 apply to those sites. <strong>Please ensure you check the legal and privacy
					 statement posted on each site you link to.</strong> </p>
					 <p><strong>Changes</strong><br>
					 We may occasionally update this privacy statement. We encourage you to
					 periodically review this privacy statement to stay informed about how
					 we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Your continued
					 use of the Site constitutes your agreement to the privacy statement and
					 any updates. <br>
