<p><strong>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We will share your Information as follows:</p>
<p><strong>At Your Instruction</strong><br>If you request us to make your Data available to a third party, and such request furthers the purposes of our Publications or the sale of our Products, we will do so.<br><br><strong>Sharing with Vendors and Service Providers</strong><br>In certain cases, we use the services of third-party vendors and service providers to assist us in providing the Publications and Products.&nbsp; We may share your Data with such vendors and service providers solely for that purpose, and we will require those parties to abide by our privacy policies.<br><br><strong>Third-Party Offers<br></strong>We may allow other companies to offer you their products and publications, including offers through our Publications, co-branded pages hosted by the third parties, or via email. Whether or not you decide to participate in any such offers is up to you. If you purchase a product or service on a co-branded page, or via a third-party offer on our Publications that requires you to submit financial and personal information, you are also consenting to our delivery of this information to that party. The offer will notify you if any financial or personally identifiable information will be shared. Such third party will be authorized to use this information in keeping with our contractual relationship with them and in accordance with their own privacy policy and information practices. We do not control these third parties and you agree that we are not liable for their acts, or any failure to act on their part.<br><br><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong>. <br>We may use aggregated, statistical information to describe our membership and to establish advertising and other business relationships with third parties. We may serve you with targeted advertisements based on your personal or profile information, but we do not provide any of this personal or profile information to an advertiser or any third party with the exception of those uses expressly disclosed in this policy. However, if you click or view an ad on our Publications then you consent to the likelihood that the advertiser will assume that you meet the targeting criteria, if any, used to display such ad, and as described above, you will be subject to the advertiser's privacy policy and information collection practices (if any).<br><br><strong>Third-Party Ad Servers</strong>. <br>We may allow third party ad servers or ad networks to display advertisements on the Publications. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as JavaScript and web beacons. Doing this allows them to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. We do not have access to or control over the cookies that may be placed by these parties on your computer, and we have no control over these parties' privacy policies or information collection practices (if any).</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers<br></strong>We may sometimes use a third party to provide specific Publications on our behalf, including sending e-mails to our members, conducting member surveys, processing transactions or performing statistical analysis of our Publications. In these cases, we may provide certain personal information, such as your name and e-mail address and other financial information necessary for the service to be provided. However, these third parties are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information and are prohibited from retaining, sharing, storing or using this information for any other purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Service Providers<br></strong>We may provide certain portions of your Data, such as your email address or name, back to your internet service provider if we have an existing advertising relationship with them. This is done to allow them to target or discontinue your exposure to our advertisements, once you have become a participating member of our Publications. As part of our agreement with your internet service provider, they will be required to maintain this information in a confidential manner and use it solely for the purpose described in this Privacy Policy.<br><br><strong>Business Transitions<br></strong>In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation or sale of all or a portion of our assets, the information we have about you will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. We reserve the right to transfer that information in connection with such transactions without notice to you.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Disclosure<br></strong>We may disclose your Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to applicable law, comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served on us, protect and defend our rights or property, or investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our terms of service.</p>

<p>California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. If you wish to opt-out of our sharing of your information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes offline, please follow the instructions in this Privacy Policy.</p>
