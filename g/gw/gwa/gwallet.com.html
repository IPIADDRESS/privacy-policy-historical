              <p class="mt21">gWallet, Inc. (“gWallet”) values the privacy of the users, subscribers, members, and others (collectively or individually, "you" or "Users") who visit and use gWallet Social Media Monetization Platform ("gWallet Platform).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              </p>
              <p>By using the gWallet Platform or visiting the gWallet web site (‘Site”) you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy, please do not use the gWallet Platform or Site.&nbsp;<br>
              </p>
              <p>This Privacy Policy should be read in connection with the gWallet Terms of Use. Your use of the gWallet Platform and Site and any personal information you provide through the gWallet Platform or Site are subject at all times to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.</p>
              <p> <strong>The Information gWallet Collects</strong> </p>
              <p>gWallet collects information from you in connection with the Site and gWallet Platform in the following manner:&nbsp;<br>
              </p>
              <p><strong>User-provided Information:</strong> If you decide to use the gWallet Platform, you may be asked to provide to gWallet what is generally called "personally identifiable" information (such as your name, email address, postal mailing address, telephone number and billing information).&nbsp; If you upload or download certain content or products from the gWallet Platform or Site, enter contests or sweepstakes, take advantage of promotions, respond to surveys, register and subscribe for certain services, or otherwise use the features and functionality of the gWallet Platform and Site. At gWallet’s request, you may also agree to provide to gWallet demographic information and information related to your favorite social networking site such as the name, address and description.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              </p>
              <p><strong>"Cookies" Information:</strong> When you access the gWallet Platform or use the Site, we may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer. gWallet may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the gWallet Platform and Site. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Some of our business partners (e.g. advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by gWallet only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              </p>
              <p><strong>"Automatically Collected" Information:</strong> When you access the gWallet Platform or Site or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This "automatically collected" information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique user ID, version of software installed, system type, screen resolutions, color capabilities, plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords, JavaScript enablement, the content and pages that you access on the gWallet Platform and Site, and the dates and times that you visit the gWallet Platform and Site, paths taken, and time spent on sites and pages within the gWallet Platform and Site.</p>
              <p><strong>Web Beacons:</strong> Our Site may contain electronic image requests (called a "single-pixel gif" or "web beacon" request) that allow us to count page views and to access cookies. Any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are typically 1-by-1 pixel files (so small that you would likely not realize that they are there), but their presence can usually be seen within a browser by clicking on "View" and then on "Source." We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters that we send to opt-in subscribers in order to count how many newsletters have been read. gWallet web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share any personally identifiable information about our Users, they are just the technique we use to compile anonymous information about Site and gWallet usage.</p>
              <p><strong>2</strong><strong>. The Way gWallet Uses Information</strong></p>
              <p>gWallet uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the gWallet Platform and Site, to allow us to charge and invoice you, as well as to track user-generated content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              </p>
              <p>If you have provided us your email address, we will use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major gWallet Platform or Site updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, or to contact you regarding any content that you have posted to or downloaded from the gWallet Platform or Site.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              </p>
              <p>gWallet uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the gWallet Platform and Site works and looks, and to create new features and functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              </p>
              <p>gWallet may use "Automatically Collected" information and "Cookies" information to: (a) automatically provide you the latest version of the gWallet application on your system; (b) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the gWallet Platform or Site; (c) monitor aggregate Site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and (d) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities in connection with your usage of the Site or gWallet Platform.</p>
              <p><strong>3</strong><strong>. When gWallet Discloses Information</strong></p>
              <p>gWallet does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent. Please be aware, however, that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the gWallet Platform and Site or related sites becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              </p>
              <p>We may disclose some limited User information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; validate credit card numbers; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist gWallet in improving the gWallet Platform and Site and creating new services features for the gWallet Platform and Site. We require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              </p>
              <p>gWallet may share aggregate statistical information gathered from you and other Users with advertisers, business partners, sponsor or other third parties. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of visitors visited a certain area on a web site.&nbsp;<br>
              </p>
              <p>gWallet may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              </p>
              <p>gWallet also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; protect gWallet from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the gWallet Platform and Site; enforce the Terms of Use; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of gWallet, our Users, or others.</p>
              <p>In the event that gWallet or the gWallet Platform or Site is sold to a third party in connection with the sale of gWallet as further described below (whether as a merger, sale of assets or other change of control of gWallet), User information would be transferred to such third party in connection with such sale, but such third party would be obligated to use such information in connection with this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.</p>
              <p>In addition, because gWallet operates globally, we may make information we gather available to worldwide business units and affiliates in connection with your use of the gWallet Platform and Site.</p>
              <p><strong>4</strong><strong>. Your Choices</strong></p>
              <p>You may, of course, decline to share your personally identifiable information with gWallet, in which case gWallet will not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the gWallet Platform and Site. You may update, correct, or delete your user information and preferences on the account information page under "My Account - Account Settings".&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              </p>
              <p>We recommend you do not divulge your account password to anyone.&nbsp;<strong>gWallet will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited telephone call or e-mail</strong>. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES.</p>
              <p><strong>5</strong><strong>. Data Security</strong></p>
              <p>gWallet uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personally identifiable information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to gWallet, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of such information, gWallet makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              </p>
              <p>If gWallet learns of a security systems breach, then we will attempt to notify you electronically through the information that you have provided to us so that you can take appropriate protective steps. gWallet may post a notice on the Site if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@myofferpal.com" target="_blank"><u>support@gwallet.com</u></a></p>
              <p><strong>6</strong><strong>. Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</strong></p>
              <p>IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE GWALLET PLATFORM AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, gWallet does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age. If gWallet learns that personally identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the gWallet Platform or Site, then gWallet will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              </p>
              <p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who uses the gWallet Platform or Site, then please contact gWallet at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@myofferpal.com" target="_blank"><u>support@gwallet.com</u></a>&nbsp;to have that child's information deleted.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The following are some resources that may help parents and legal guardians in monitoring and limiting your children's access to certain types of material on the Internet.
