            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This privacy policy applies 
            to the operations of all sites, brands and services provided by Gameworld 
            Industries Pty Ltd.</font>  
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="3">Overall 
              privacy statement</font></strong><br>
              Gameworld Industries takes your privacy seriously. Because we gather 
              certain types of information about our users we want to help you 
              understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and 
              use of that information. This privacy statement discloses the types 
              of information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change 
              it. These privacy practices apply to the Web site that you were 
              viewing when you clicked through to this policy, which is operated 
              by Gameworld Industries, its partner, or affiliate.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1. What 
              personally identifiable information does Gameworld Industries collect?</strong><br>
              Gameworld Industries' primary goal in collecting personal information 
              is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services. 
              Because Gameworld Industries derives its revenue mainly from advertising, 
              collecting information is essential to keeping our services affordable 
              to users.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gameworld Industries 
              collects personally identifiable information when you provide it 
              to us, such as when you register on one of our sites, when you subscribe 
              for an e-mail newsletter, when you use certain services, and when 
              you visit Gameworld Industries' pages and read newsletters. Several 
              of the services that we offer on our sites, such as message boards, 
              may require registration as a condition of use. Once you register 
              with one of our Gameworld Industries sites you are no longer anonymous 
              to us. Gameworld Industries may also receive information about you 
              from other sources and add it to the information you provided to 
              us.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2. What 
              anonymous information does Gameworld Industries collect?</strong><br>
              <em>Cookies</em><br>
              Your Internet browser has a feature called "cookies" which 
              store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to 
              any of our sites. However, cookies tell us nothing about who you 
              are unless you specifically give us personally identifiable information. 
              You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit most Gameworld 
              Industries sites, although active participation in certain areas 
              of our sites may require cookies. In addition, you may elect not 
              to allow cookies to be collected by selecting certain options on 
              your browser.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Web bugs 
              &amp; servers</em><br>
              We use electronic images known as Web bugs--sometimes called transparent 
              GIFs, clear GIFs, or beacons--that allow us to track general user 
              traffic patterns. Gameworld Industries also automatically receives 
              and records information from our servers and from your browser, 
              including your IP address, the time, and information about the page 
              you requested.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We use tracking 
              technologies in a variety of ways, including: </font></p>
            <ul>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Keeping 
                count of return visits to our site or our advertisers' or partners' 
                sites </font></li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Accumulating 
                and reporting anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass), statistical 
                information on Web site and advertisement usage </font></li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Determining 
                which features users like best </font></li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Saving your 
                password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit 
                our sites </font></li>
            </ul>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Third-party 
              advertisement servers</em><br>
              Some of our advertisers use third-party companies to serve their 
              advertisements on our sites and, in some cases, in our HTML-formatted 
              newsletters. Often, these third-party advertising companies employ 
              cookie and Web bug technologies to measure advertisement effectiveness. 
              We do not give any personally identifiable information to them as 
              part of this relationship. Use of their tracking technology is subject 
              to their own privacy policies.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>3. How does Gameworld Industries use the information?</strong><br>
              Gameworld Industries uses the information we gather for four general 
              purposes: </font></p>
            <ul>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To customize 
                the advertising and content you see </font></li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> To enhance 
                the user experience in our network of sites. We use tracking information 
                to determine how well each page performs overall based on aggregate 
                user demographics and traffic patterns to those pages. This helps 
                us continue to build a better service for you </font></li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> To fulfill 
                your requests for certain products and services, such as sending 
                out electronic newsletters and enabling users to participate in 
                paid services, polls, contests, message boards, and auctions </font></li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> To send 
                you information you agreed to receive about topics we think will 
                be of interest to you </font></li>
            </ul>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong> 4. How 
              does Gameworld Industries share the information?</strong><br>
              <em>Personally identifiable information</em><br>
              Gameworld Industries will make your personally identifiable information 
              available to other companies or people when: </font></p>
            <ul>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We have 
                your consent to share the information </font></li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We have 
                engaged companies to work with or on behalf of Gameworld Industries 
                to provide a product or service that you have requested, such 
                as opt-in e-mail announcements </font></li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You use 
                co-branded services. When you use a co-branded service within

                information back to that service partner. Their use of your information 
                is subject to their applicable privacy policies. </font></li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We respond 
                to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process; or we believe that 
                your actions violate applicable laws, Gameworld Industries' Terms 
                of Use or any usage guidelines for specific products or services, 
                or threaten the rights, property, or safety of Gameworld Industries, 
                our users, or others </font></li>
            </ul>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <em>Aggregate 
              information</em><br>
              Gameworld Industries aggregates personally identifiable information 
              and discloses such information in a non-personally identifiable 
              manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional, 
              and other purposes. We do not disclose to these entities any information 
              that could be used to identify you personally.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>5. What 
              are my options?</strong><br>
              Users who would rather not provide any of the user data requested 
              by our registration process do not need to register with us. You 
              can still view much of the content and use many of the services 
              offered by our sites without registering.<br>
              We also give users the following options: </font></p>
            <ul>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Opting not 
                to receive our electronic newsletters or those of third parties 
                when registering. Users who opt-in may remove themselves from 
                mailing lists at any time through the subscription management 
                pages or by following the instructions at the end of the e-mail 
                they received from us; </font></li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Opting not 
                to provide certain personal information when registering for a 
                site. </font></li>
            </ul>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>6. How 
              can I update my personally identifiable information?</strong><br>
              You can correct or change the information collected during registration 
              for any site. The instructions for doing this can be found in our 
              member services areas. Users may change this information at any 
              time and as often as necessary. Users who are experiencing problems 
              or who have questions about how our services work can contact us 
              by e-mail. Currently, we do not offer users a means by which to 
              completely delete personal information established at the time of 
              registration.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>7. How will I know if the privacy policy is changed?</strong><br>
              Any modifications to our privacy practices will be reflected first 
              within this area of our network of Web sites. If there is a material 
              change in our privacy practices, we will indicate on our sites that 
              our privacy practices have changed and provide a link to the new 
              privacy statement. If we are going to be using the information collected 
              from users in a manner materially different from that stated at 
              the time of collection we will send affected users written notice 
              of the change.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>8. Privacy 
              of children</strong><br>
              Our network of sites is not directed to children under the age of 
              13. We operate our network of sites in compliance with the Children's 
              Online Privacy Protection Act and do not permit registration by, 
              and will not knowingly collect or use personally identifiable information 
              from, anyone under 13 years of age. This requirement is clearly 
              posted during the registration process.</font></p>
