<p><strong>GLOBALWIDE PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>

<p>This <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> sets out the policies of Global Wide Media, Inc. (“GWM”) in relation to any information that you may share with GWM in your capacity as a GWM Publisher or applicant and as a visitor to GWM’s websites.</p>
<p>In this statement, when we talk about “GWM” or “we” or “our”, we are referring to GWM, and its affiliated companies. </p>
<p>By filling out an application to become a Publisher and/or accessing and using the GWM Publisher Network/CPABuilder.com or visiting any of GWM’s websites, you hereby agree to this Privacy Policy in its entirety. </p>
<p>GWM reserves the right to update this policy from time to time. Your continued use of any website or service covered by this policy will constitute your agreement to the same.</p>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
<h5>1. ���� Personal Information</h5>
<p>The GWM Publisher Network is an online marketing network of advertisers and publishers. As a Publisher, you may be required from time to time to provide GWM with certain personal information, including without limitation, your name, address, telephone number, electronic mail address, credit card information, bank account information, and your social insurance or social security number (collectively, your “Personal Information”).</p>
<p>GWM will use your Personal Information to establish your publisher account, to communicate with you, to remit payments to you from time to time when due, and for ongoing record keeping, as required by law.</p>
<p>GWM will not release Personal Information about you without your permission, except:</p>
<ul>
 <li><p>(a) as permitted in this Privacy Policy;</p></li>
 <li><p>(b) as permitted in any written agreement between you and GWM;</p></li>
 <li><p>(c) to third party payment processors and/or banks in order to process payment to you;</p></li>
 <li><p>(d) where we believe it is reasonably necessary to conduct business; and</p></li>
 <li><p>(e) where we believe it is necessary to enforce our rights under any Agreement between you and GWM.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You may manage and control the information that you have voluntarily provided to us by logging into your account. </p>
<p>In the event of your application to become a publisher of GWM is not successful, your information will be stored by GWM for archiving purposes and will not be shared with any third parties unless it is in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case or administrative investigation. </p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Information on users under the age of eighteen. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor the Internet based activities of their children.</p>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
<h5>2. ���� Anonymous Information</h5>
<p>�“Anonymous Information” is information other than Personal Information, and includes the domain names, IP addresses and type of browsers that you may use, from time to time, referring URLs, and other, non-personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>When you access any site or service covered by this Privacy Policy, we collect Anonymous Information. We use this information for system administration, to market research (which is shared with our advertisers), to personalize your experience at our site, to show you more relevant advertising messages, and, generally, to improve our services. We share this Anonymous Information with selected advertisers and partners in order to deliver to you more relevant advertising messages.</p>
<p><strong>GWM</strong> will not share any Anonymous Information if that information is or will be linked to your Personal Information, unless we have given you notice as described above and you have given us authorization to do so.<strong></strong></p>
<p>When you visit GWM’s websites, we send a cookie and/or gif file ("Cookie") to assign an anonymous, unique identifier to your Internet browser. A Cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing non-personally identifiable information about you. Cookies have many benefits to enhance your experience while visiting GWM’s websites. To disable and reject certain Cookies, follow the instructions associated with your Internet browser. GWM reserves the right to retain Cookie data indefinitely.</p>
<p><u>GWM can and will use IP addresses to identify users of our site when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our site’s Terms of Use or Terms of Service, or to protect our service, site, or other users.</u></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>3.�������� Sharing Personal Information</h5>
<p>We will not share your Personal Information unless we have first given you notice that we might share your data, and you have authorized us to do so. Our partners who receive information from us have the right to use the data we provide them (sometimes, in connection with other information they may have gathered about you), but are generally prohibited from sharing this information with other companies or people. In addition, if we add new features or services that might require the sharing of your Personal Information with other parties, we will provide you with notice and the opportunity to opt-in to receive these offers.</p>
<p>In certain special cases, we may disclose your Personal Information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to you, or otherwise injuring or interfering with GWM’s rights, property or operations, other GWM users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose your Personal Information when we believe the law requires it, or in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case or administrative investigation.</p>
<p>Finally, where, in our sole discretion after undertaking such investigation or investigations as we see fit, we determine that you have engaged in conduct which might be considered fraudulent or which might bring the reputation or standing of GWM into disrepute either with the general public or with a client or potential client of GWM, we reserve the right to release your Personal Information to such persons or third parties as we consider necessary in order to prevent you from causing injury to, or otherwise injuring or interfering, now or in the future, with GWM's rights, property or operations or otherwise the rights, property or operations of anyone else who could be harmed by such conduct.</p>
