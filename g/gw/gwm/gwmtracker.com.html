<p>This Privacy Policy governs your use of this Website  and any content, products or services made available from or through this  website including any sub domains thereof (“Website”). The Website is made  available by GlobalWide Media, Inc. (Hereinafter referred to as “Company”).</p>
<p><br>
  By visiting this Website and requesting information,  products or services offered on or through this Website, you agree to the terms  of this Privacy Policy, as they may be amended from time to time. As Company  updates or expands its Website, services or products, this Privacy Policy may  change and the changes are effective upon posting. Please check back frequently  for updates as it is your sole responsibility to be aware of changes. Company  does not provide notice of changes in any manner other than by posting the  changes at this Website. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and part of,  the Website Terms and Conditions which govern your use of this Website in  general.</p>
<p><br>
  This Website is intended for users who are located in  the United States of America. The Privacy Policy shall be interpreted under the  laws of the United States.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>PURPOSE OF THE PRIVACY  POLICY. </strong></p>
<p><br>
  This Policy describes the information collection, use,  and dissemination practices of Company, its parent, subsidiaries and registered  d/b/a companies (Collectively Referred herein after as “Company”) and all  related websites owned or registered to Company. It governs Company’s right to  collect, use, store and disclose information provided by You on its (a) this  Website, (b) Company’s other Websites, (c) on various Third Party websites, and  (d) Company's other information collection and distribution practices,  including the acquisition of your information from and to Third Parties.  Company is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices  of third party websites or applications which company does not own or control.</p>
<p><br>
  By providing us with Personal Information about  yourself on our Website or in the course of using our services, you consent to  the transfer of your Personal Information, and any other data we acquire about  you from third-party service providers for commercial use.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE,  AND DISSEMINATION PRACTICES. </strong></p>
<p><br>
  <strong>1.0.</strong>  Collection of Information.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>1.1.</strong> User  Direct Information. Each time you provide or transmit information via the  Website, Company may obtain and collect personal information about you,  including, but not limited to, your name, email address, mailing address,  social security number, credit card information, bank account information and  telephone or cell phone number (collectively referred to as "Personal  Information"). </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>1.2.</strong> Survey  Information. Company may collect Personal Information from you when you  voluntarily complete a Company survey, order form, or a registration page  either online by using the internet or offline by providing this information  through the mail, in person or using a telephone. This information may be  collected by surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third  parties. This method of collection is collectively known as a “Survey.” In such  Surveys, Company or a third party may ask you to provide Personal Information  including your name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers  (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range,  education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment  information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may  be requested from time to time. Company may also collect such information  concerning you from another source and uses that information in combination  with information provided from the Website or Surveys. Completing the Surveys  is completely voluntary, and you are under no obligation to provide Survey Information  to Company or a third party. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>1.3.</strong> Third  Party Information. Company may collect Personal Information from you when you  provide information to a third party and Company subsequently acquires or uses  the information provided by the third party. Such information may include, but  is not limited to, your name, email address, street address, zip code,  telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date,  gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment,  personal and online interests, and such other information you may have provided  to the third party. When acquiring this information, Company seeks assurances  from the third party that you agreed to provide and have such information  acquired by Company. If you did not give express permission, or you would like  to remove your permission, you may suppress all of your information by sending  notification to us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@globalwidemedia.com" moz-do-not-send="true">unsubscribe@globalwidemedia.com</a>.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>1.4.</strong> Other  Methods of Collecting Personal Information. Other occasions when Company  obtains information from you include: (1) when you claim a prize or seek to  redeem an offer by Company or by a third party; (2) when you request assistance  through Company’s customer service department; and (3) when you voluntarily  subscribe to a Company service or newsletter.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>1.5.</strong>  Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology. Company  currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related  information about you with information about you in its database. Additionally,  Company may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>    
    <p><strong>(a)</strong> Cookies. “Cookies” are a feature       in your browser software. If enabled, we may write cookies that may store       small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the       pages of this Site. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal       the most to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When       you visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content       according to your preferences. We may use cookies to: keep track of the       number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate,       statistical information on website usage; deliver specific content to you       based on your interests or past viewing history; save your password for ease       of access to our Site. You can disable cookies, although the Site may not       function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be modified to       accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set.       You may read more about cookies at <a href="http://cookiecentral.com">http://cookiecentral.com</a>.       In order to use all of the features and functionality of Company’s       websites, you need to accept cookies. </p>
  </li>
  <li>    
    <p><strong>(b)</strong> Web Beacons. A web beacon is a       programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page, but       can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database       and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual       in a database. This allows Company to track certain websites you visit.       Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing       purposes to determine products or services you may be interested in. In       addition to using web beacons on web pages, Company also uses web beacons       in email messages sent to individuals listed in Company’s database. </p>
  </li>
  <li>    
    <p><strong>(c)</strong> IP Addresses. Company automatically       tracks certain information based upon your behavior on the site. We may       use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics,       interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and       our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from       (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to       (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser       information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP")       is a unique Internet "address" which is assigned to you by your Internet       Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area network ("LAN"),       DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a       particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers,       collecting information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP       address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the       cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using       the Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are       connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you       visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those       websites and their pages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    
    <p><strong>(d)</strong> Computer Profiles. Company may       also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us       understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For       instance, Company may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain       names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen       resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings,       cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When       you provide us with Personal Identification Information, we are able to       use such visitor data to identify you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    
    <p><strong>(e) </strong>Data Analysis. Data Analysis       technology may be employed from time to time if used by a Client of       Company.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    
    <p><strong>(f)</strong> New Technology. The use of technology       on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly developing.       As a result, Company strongly encourages individuals to revisit this       policy for any updates regarding its use of new technology.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.6.</strong> No  Information Collected from Children. Company will never knowingly collect any  Personal Information about children under the age of 13. If Company obtains  actual knowledge that it has collected Personal Information about a child under  the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from its database.  Because it does not collect such information, Company has no such information  to use or to disclose to third parties. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>1.7.</strong> Credit  Card Information and Bank Account Information. Company may, in certain  instances, collect credit card numbers, bank account information and related  information when an individual places an order on Company’s Website. When the  credit card or bank account information is submitted to Company, such  information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. Company  will use the credit card information or bank account information for purposes  of processing and completing the transaction you requested on the Website, and  the credit card information or bank account information will be disclosed to  third parties as necessary to complete the requested purchase transaction. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>2.0.</strong> Use of  Personal Information.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>2.1.</strong> General  Use. The following paragraphs describe how Company currently uses Personal  Information, but Company may change or broaden its use at any time. As noted  below, Company may update this policy from time to time. Company may use  Personal Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of  email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, mobile  marketing, online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other  possible uses. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>2.2.</strong> Email and Unsubscribe Policy. Company uses  Personal Information to provide third party promotional offers by email to  individuals. Company may maintain separate email lists for different purposes.  If email recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular  list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to  unsubscribe from the particular list. To unsubscribe from all Company’s email  lists, a person must send an email to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@globalwidemedia.com">unsubscribe@globalwidemedia.com</a>.</p>
<p><br>
  Company's unsubscribe process impacts only the future  delivery of electronic mailings disseminated by Company on its own behalf. You  may still receive electronic mailings sent on behalf of Third Parties and your  Personal Information may still be shared with Third Parties for use in offline  marketing and data appends, including email appends unless you unsubscribe as  provided above.</p>
<p><br>
  You should also note that unsubscribing from Company’s  electronic mailings will not automatically unsubscribe your information from  any Third Party business associates and licensees of the data. Since Third  Party associates and licensee partners maintain separate databases from  Company, and you will need to unsubscribe from each source individually, if  desired. This allows you the freedom to pick and choose which subscriptions to  maintain and which to discontinue.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>2.3. </strong>Content  of Email Messages. You may receive certain commercial email messages sent by  third parties for products which may be of interest to you. In such case, an  Advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" and the email will have  a method at the bottom of the email to unsubscribe from that Advertiser.  Company is not responsible for third party emails sent to you.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>2.4.</strong> Solicited Email. Company only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the  Website to receive email from Company or to individuals who have agreed on a  Third Party website to receive email from Third Parties. As such, Company does  not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, United States statutes  requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to  Company's email messages.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>2.5. </strong>Targeted Advertising. Company may use Personal Information to target  advertising to an individual. When an individual is using the Internet, Company  uses Technology Information to associate an individual with that person's  Personal Information, and Company attempts to show advertising for products and  services in which the person has expressed an interest in the Surveys,  indicated an interest by means of Technology Information, and otherwise.  Company may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail,  telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication to provide  promotional offers.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>2.6.</strong> Telemarketing. Company may use Personal Information to advertise, directly or  indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using  telephones and cell phones. You may have your telephone number or cell phone  number listed on a state or federal do not call registry. By registering and  using this Site, you agree that such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry  and/or an application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16  CFR §310 et seq. (the "ATSR"). Notwithstanding that your telephone  number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, you  have authorized us to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the  ATSR.  Moreover, by registering with, or requesting information from, a  third-party advertiser at or through the Website or other advertisement media  made available by us (e.g., email marketing), you agree that such action shall  constitute a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application with the respective  third-party advertiser for purposes of the ATSR and you may be contacted via  email, direct mail and/or telemarketing by such third-party advertiser in  accordance with the ATSR. Further, if you are residing outside the United  States, by registering and using this Website, you acknowledge that the  processing of your Personal Information may involve the transfer of such  Personal Information from within or outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”)  to countries within or outside the EEA whose data protection regulation may not  be as stringent as that within the European Union. We may use Personal  Information to provide the services you've requested, including services that  display customized content and advertising. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>2.7. </strong>Wireless Addresses. If the e-mail address you provide to Company is a wireless  e-mail address, you agree to receive messages at such address from Company or  its business associates (unless and until you have elected not to receive such  messages by following the instructions in the unsubscribe portion of this  policy). You understand that your wireless carrier's standard rates apply to  these messages. You represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the  wireless device on which messages will be received, and that you are authorized  to approve the applicable charges.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>2.8.</strong> Short  Message Service. Company may make available a service through which you can  receive messages on your wireless device via short message service (“SMS  Service”). Data obtained from you in connection with this SMS service may  include your name, address, cell phone number, your provider's name, and the  date, time, and content of your messages. You represent that you are 18 years  of age and the owner or authorized user of the wireless device on which  messages will be received, and that you are authorized to approve the  applicable charges. In addition to any fee of which you are notified your  provider's standard messaging rates apply to our confirmation and all  subsequent SMS correspondence. All charges are billed by and payable to your  mobile service provider. Company will not be liable for any delays in the  receipt of any SMS messages, as delivery is subject to effective transmission  from your network operator. SMS message services are provided on an AS IS  basis. Company may also obtain the date, time and content of your messages in  the course of your use of the SMS Service. We will use the information we  obtain in connection with our SMS Service in accordance with this Privacy  Policy. If fees are charged to your wireless account invoice, we may provide  your carrier with your applicable information in connection therewith. Your wireless  carrier and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless  device usage, and their practices are governed by their own policies.</p>
<p><br>
  You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is  provided via wireless systems which use radios (and other means) to transmit  communications over complex networks. We do not guarantee that your use of the  SMS Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any  lack of privacy or security you may experience. You are fully responsible for  taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your  situation and intended use of the SMS Service. We may also access the content  of your account and wireless account with your carrier for the purpose of  identifying and resolving technical problems and service-related complaints.  You may remove your information from Company’s database. If you remove your  information from Company’s database it will no longer be used by Company for  secondary purposes, disclosed to third parties, or used by Company or third  parties to send promotional correspondence to you. You may remove your  information by sending your request in writing via email to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@globalwidemedia.com">unsubscribe@globalwidemedia.com</a> or by sending "STOP", "END", "QUIT" to the SMS  text message you have received.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>2.9.</strong> Use of  Technology Information. Company may use Technology Information (1) to match a  person's Personal Information and Third Party List Information to other  categories of Personal Information to make and improve profiles of individuals,  (2) to track a person's online browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to  determine which areas of Company's websites are most frequently visited. This  information helps Company to better understand the online habits of individuals  so that Company can target advertising and promotions to them.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>2.10. </strong>Profiles of Individuals. Company may use  Personal Information to make a profile of an individual. A profile can be  created by combining Survey Information and Third Party List Information with  other sources of Personal Information such as information obtained from public  databases.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>2.11. </strong>Storage of Personal Information. Company stores the Personal Information in a  database on its’ computers. Company computers have security measures (such as a  firewall and password protections) in place to protect against the loss,  misuse, and alteration of the information under Company’s control. Not  withstanding such measures, Company cannot guarantee that its security measures  will prevent its computers from being illegally accessed, and the Personal  Information on them stolen or altered.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>3.0. </strong>Other  Use of Personal Information. Company may use your Personal Information in the  following ways: </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>3.1. </strong>Public  Forums. When you contribute to a public area or feature of our Website, such as  a chat room, bulletin board, list serve, blog, wiki or other open forum that we  may make available on or through our Website, the information that you submit  will be made available to the general public and will not be considered  “Personal Information” for purposes of this Privacy Policy. For this reason, we  recommend that you do not submit any sensitive information, including your full  name, home address, phone number, other information that would enable other  users to locate you or your financial information on these areas of our  Website.
