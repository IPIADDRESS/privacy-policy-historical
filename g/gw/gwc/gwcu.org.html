Whenever you use Account Access, Goldenwest’s server will respond to your transmission by sending this key that is authenticated by your browser.

To give you the the best online experience, our Internet home banking system utilizes 'cookies,' which are very small files that a Web site sends to the member's browser for record-keeping purposes. Cookies function as identification cards, recording passwords and preferences. Cookies cannot be executed as code, nor can they deliver viruses. Browsers can be set to deliver a message when a cookie has been sent, allowing the member to decide whether to accept or reject it. In order to tailor Web site content to our members' interests, all cookies must be accepted. All of our cookies are temporary, which means that they are active only as long as the member's browser is running. Cookies expire when the session has ended. <br \=""><br \="">
