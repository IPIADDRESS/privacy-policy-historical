<h1>What information do we gather about you?</h1>

<p>The information we gather falls into two categories: 1) personal information you voluntarily supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for an online discussion, enter a contest or provide your e-mail address and 2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our Site.</p>

<p><b><u>Personally Identifiable Information</u></b></p>

<p><b>Registration for our Web sites</b></p>

<p>Anyone can view the Site, but a free registration process is required to access the full range of information and services we offer. The Site requires that you supply a unique e-mail address and demographic information (zip code, age, sex, household income to register. By using the Site, you are agreeing to the terms of our Member Agreement accessible on the applicable Halifax Site your are using).</p>

<p><b>Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers</b></p>

<p>On occasion, we collect personal information from readers in connection with optional sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information is to be shared with a third party other than a Halifax company, we will notify you at the time of collection. If you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer.

</p><p><b>Reader Surveys, Reader Panels and Market Research</b></p>
<p>We may collect personal information from readers in connection with voluntary surveys. Data may be collected on our Web sites, on the phone or through the mail. The information you provide in answer to optional survey questions may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.</p>

<p><b>Mobile Messaging Service</b></p>

<p>We may elect to offer certain text messaging services (the "SMS Service"). We use the information collected from your interaction with the SMS Service solely for the purposes of improving the SMS Service. The information will not be provided, sold, licensed, rented, assigned or disclosed, except as required by law. We will not use your phone number to initiate a call or SMS text message to you without your express prior consent. Your wireless carrier and other service providers also collect data about your SMS Service usage: their practices are governed by their own privacy policies.</p>

<p>We collect the mobile phone number you use to send us a text message and the content of the messages sent between you and the applicable Halifax company. When you send a text message to us or through our Site, we log the incoming phone number, the wireless provider associated with the number, and the date and time of the transaction. The only information we automatically collect is that related to the use of our Mobile Services. We use this data to analyze the message traffic in order to operate, develop and improve our SMS Service.</p>

<p><b><u>Non-personally Identifiable Information</u></b></p>

<p><b>Information Collected by Us using Technology</b></p>

<p>As is standard practice on many Web sites, we use "cookies", Web Beacons and other similar technologies to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there. You will not be able to access certain areas of our Web sites, including the Site, if your computer does not accept cookies from us. We reserve the right to place a cookie on your computer with a unique anonymous number to ensure that your browser does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads in a series and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a particular ad or visited a particular Web page. For more detailed information about our use of cookies, see the "Cookies" section on the Registration FAQ.</p>

<p><b>Information Collected by Third Parties using Technology</b></p>

<p>Some of the services and/or advertisements on certain of our Web sites (including the Site) are delivered or served by third-party companies that may place or recognize cookies or Web Beacon to track certain non-personally identifiable information about our Web site users. For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, some advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser, in order to collect certain non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our Web sites and other Web sites. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads based on your interests on other Web sites.</p>

<p>We do not have access to, nor control over, advertisers' or service providers' cookies or how they may be used.</p>

</a><p><a name="1">Some websites may belong to ad networks that use your browsing history across websites to choose which ads to display on their sites; the displayed ads may include advertising for Company. To learn more, and to opt out of seeing interest-based advertisements on these sites, visit the </a><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">Network Advertising Initiative</a> and the <a href="http://aboutads.info">Digital Advertising Alliance</a> websites (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org</a> and <a href="http://aboutads.info">www.aboutads.info</a>). Websites may also offer their own opt-out methods for interest-based advertising.</p>

<p>You have choices about the collection of interest based information in this way:

<p>Your access to our Web sites will not be affected if you do not accept cookies served by third parties.</p>

<p><b>Yahoo Ads</b></p>

<p>Yahoo! is an ad network partner that displays ads on our sites. To improve your ad experience on our sites and elsewhere on the Internet, we may send non-personal information to Yahoo! based on your browser's activities, such as type of pages viewed and categories of interests, so that the advertising you see is relevant to you. Yahoo! also may use information regarding its own users to select which ads to display. <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/opt_out/targeting/details.html">Learn more about Yahoo!'s ad practices</a>, including how to opt out of using anonymous information to select which ads to show you.
