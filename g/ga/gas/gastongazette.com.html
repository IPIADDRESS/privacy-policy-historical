        This site does not collect personally identifiable information about
        individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such
        individuals. A user's personally identifiable information may be used by
        <b>GASTON GAZETTE </b>and its affiliates for editorial purposes. <b>GASTON
        GAZETTE </b>may also use such information for marketing and promotional
        purposes. We may share your personally identifiable information with
        other companies with which we conduct business. For example, if you
        enter our contests, make a purchase or use our e-mail services, we
        sometimes rely on outside companies to provide these services to you. In
        such cases, we need to provide your personally identifiable information
        to them. Or if you choose to purchase items through our commerce site,
        we will forward your information to third parties for credit card
        processing and order fulfillment. We also sometimes provide your
        information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that
        meet your needs. While <b>GASTON GAZETTE </b>will seek to require such
        third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not
        authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose
