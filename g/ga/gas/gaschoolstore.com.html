We at Great American Opportunities, Inc. respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy pertains to our company, its affiliates, divisions and their various fundraising programs and business collaborations, including QSP, Mikla Foods, Fundraising.com, QSP Canada, etc., (collectively “Great American”), and describes how Great American may collect and use the personal information which you provide on our web sites and the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This Privacy Policy describes the information we may collect from you on or through our web sites, the manner in which we may use such information, and how we protect it. We may modify or supplement this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting those changes on this page. Any changes will become effective as of the date of posting. Please review this Privacy Policy often so you are always fully informed of any changes.<br>
We have tried to keep this policy as simple as possible; however, if you are not familiar with terms like “cookies”, “IP addresses”, “tags”, “browsers”, etc., then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Great American; thus, whether you are new to Great American or a long time trading partner, please do take the time to get to know our practices. If you have any questions, please contact us as directed below.<br>
<strong>Collection and Retention of Information</strong><br>
When you visit our web sites, whether to request merchandise and services or simply to become better acquainted with Great American’s various offerings, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself, including your name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. In addition, purchases by credit card will require your disclosure of your credit card account number and security number for that credit card. In other instances, we (or qualified contractors/vendors on our behalf) may automatically collect some non-personally identifiable computer information regarding your use of our web sites, such as the type of computer operating system you are using (such as Windows 8, Mac OS, etc.) and web browser that you are using (such as Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.), as well as information regarding your Internet service provider, IP address, and the frequency with which you visit various parts of our web sites.<br>
We may use cookies to identify you when you visit us and to keep track of where you go so we can provide you with more personalized service by way of our web sites. A “cookie” is a small piece of information that we may place in your computer browser to collect information regarding your preferences. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. You can use your browser settings to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. If you turn off cookies, you will not have access to some of the features on our web sites, and some of our services may not function properly.<br>
We may also request your username, email address and telephone number  if you submit a form through the “Contact Us” portion of our web site so that we may respond to the inquiry. We collect the email content, email address and phone number for the sole purpose of responding directly on a one‑time basis to a specific inquiry. We may retain this information for customer service purposes.<br>
When you order online or subscribe to any of our web sites, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself to facilitate the transaction. This information may include your first and last name, username, password, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, and payment information. In connection with online subscriptions or purchases, we collect personally‑identifiable financial information. Credit card or account billing information, including mailing addresses, are collected at the time of purchase. Great American will&nbsp;store this information only if necessary and will do so in accordance&nbsp;with Payment Card Industry standards.<br>
In addition, such necessary information very well may be stored by our payments processing vendor(s) for the purpose of processing payments, collection efforts, and for fraud prevention purposes. Our payments processing vendor has agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal and financial information it obtains from our web sites and only to use this information on our behalf for the legitimate purposes outlined above. Our financial institution is bound by all applicable privacy laws relating to the provision of financial services.<br>
Great American may, from time to time, offer forums or the ability to comment through some of our web sites. If you post personally‑identifiable information on a forum, you should be aware that such information could be read, collected or used by other users. We are not responsible for any personally‑identifiable information you choose to publish through such forums. These forums are intended for use only by users over the age of 13 years.&nbsp;<br>
If you use Google<sup>TM</sup>, Facebook<sup>TM</sup>, or similar social media connect functions to log in, we may collect your name and e‑mail address to authenticate you and your profile picture to use as your picture on our applicable web site. This feature is intended only for users over the age of 13 years.<br>
We will not ask children for personal information. It is up to a child’s parent(s) or lawful guardian to inform Great American of the information we should obtain, store and use about their children. As Great American makes available subscription sites and online stores for children, you should take responsibility for registering the child on the applicable web site and provide correct information about the child, including the child’s name, email address, username, age, telephone number and password, if necessary to gain access to the subscribed service. It is not our intent or wish to collect any such information directly from a child so we ask that you monitor and manage your child’s use of our online stores, subscription services, and web sites. Let us know of good suggestions you may have to help us make our websites even safer and more user-friendly for children.<br>
<strong>Only Necessary Personally-Identifiable Information About Your Child</strong><br>
We do not condition a child’s participation in any program, prize, or offering of Great American or any web site activity on any more personally-identifiable information than is reasonably necessary for the participation.<br>
<strong>Use and Disclosure of Information</strong><br>
Great American may use your personally identifiable information (email address, telephone number, etc.) to process orders, follow up with customer service, monitor your subscription, pursue collection activities, and market our products and services. The information we collect is shared as necessary with agents or contractors who assist in providing support for our internal operations. We also may use this information to notify you of new or special programs, prizes, and offerings of Great American.<br>
If you do not want any such updates, either by email or text, simply opt out of those communications by sending an email to that effect to our privacy-related email address, <a href="mailto:privacy@gafundraising.com" title="mailto:privacy@gafundraising.com">privacy@gafundraising.com</a>, or, via U.S. mail, c/o Privacy Officer, Great American Opportunities, Inc., 2451 Atrium Way, Nashville, TN 37214, indicating “Privacy Opt Out” in the subject line. Please allow up to 21 days for the opt out to take effect.<br>
Further use of the information we collect in the aggregate may involve statistical analysis of site usage, our customers’ purchases, and the popularity of certain programs, prizes and offerings of Great American. Statistical analysis is generally done in the aggregate but we may track this information on an individual basis for such purposes.<br>
We may use email addresses and usernames to track usage and to ensure users are following our Terms of Use. In addition, we may use an email address, username, or IP address to ban a user temporarily or permanently from a web site that the user engages in any inappropriate manner.<br>
