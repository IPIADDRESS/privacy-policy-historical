We use this information to monitor and improve our Website.</li>
<li>Cookies and Tracer Tags. Our Website uses a technology called “cookies.” A cookie is a tiny element of data that our Website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. All pages on our Website where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. If you have registered with our Website, these cookies: (1) may let us know who you are; (2) are necessary to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver products and personalized services; and (3) will provide us and our service providers with information that we will use to personalize our Website in accordance with your preferences. Cookies are also required to optimize your shopping experience in that they allow you to add multiple items to your shopping basket before checking out. You may set your web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. However, should you decide not to accept cookies from our Website, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our Website. Our Website may also use a technology called “tracer tags,” which may also be referred to as “Clear GIFs” or “Web Beacons.” This technology allows us to understand which pages you visit on our Website. These tracer tags are used to help us optimize and tailor our Website for you and other future Website visitors.</li>
<li>Security of Personal Information. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure of Personal Information in our custody and control.

<li>Secure Shopping. When you place orders on our Website, all of your order information, including your card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) and/or Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) technology. SSL and TLS technology cause your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our secure server. SSL and TLS technology, both industry standards, are designed to prevent someone other than operators of our Website from capturing and viewing your Personal Information. Because any order information you provide to us on our Website will be transmitted using a secure connection, if your web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our Website. The most recent versions of the most commonly used web browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Opera, can support a secure connection and can be downloaded for free from the Microsoft, Mozilla, Apple, and Opera websites respectively.</li>

We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. Gaspari will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (including unsolicited correspondence such as letters, phone calls or e-mail messages).</li>

These other sites are outside of our control. Please be aware that these websites may collect information about you, and operate according to their own privacy practices, which may differ from those set forth in our Privacy Policy. Remember to consult the privacy policy of any other website you visit, as once you are outside of this Website, any information you submit is no longer within Gaspari’s control.</li>
<li>Privacy Policy Modifications. From time to time we may modify or amend this Privacy Policy in order to comply with new laws or regulations or to reflect future changes in our business practices. Any changes in our policies will be communicated on this page, so please check back from time to time. We also may post a notice on our Website or send an email describing any changes.</li>
