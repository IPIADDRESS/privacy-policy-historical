<h3>Do Gap Companies share personal information about me?</h3>

	<p>We may share your personal information in the following ways:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><span class="bullet">»</span>When you provide personal information to one of our Gap Companies, we may share that information with our other Gap Companies, which may be located in the United States or Canada.</li>
		<li><span class="bullet">»</span>We may share information about you with our service providers who manage our customer information and perform services on our behalf, such as fulfilling promotions, sending communications to our customers, conducting surveys, etc. </li>
		<li><span class="bullet">»</span>We may share information about you when we team up with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests, or promotions to our customers. </li>
		</ul>
	
	<p>We require that all of these companies provide a comparable level of protection for personal information, including, in the case of our service providers, that they limit their use of personal information to providing these services to us.</p>
	
	<p>In addition, if you choose to participate in any scrip, loyalty, or similar program in which a Gap Companies brand is a participating vendor, and you authorize Gap Companies or our credit card processor to provide information about purchases you make to the company administering the program, we will share personal information about you with that program. Scrip programs allow you to instruct us to divert a percentage of the amount you spend on purchases at our brands to participating schools and other non-profit organizations. Loyalty programs allow you to earn "points" on purchases at our brands, which you may then use toward certain rewards offered by the loyalty programs in which you participate. The information you authorize us to disclose to the scrip or loyalty program may include your credit card number and the date and amount of your purchase, and may also include your name and other information you have asked us to provide. Please note that once we disclose this information, the scrip or loyalty company may use and share it with others in accordance with its own privacy policy. You should review these policies carefully, as we have no control over them.</p>
	
	<p>In the unlikely event of a sale or merger of Gap Companies or any of our businesses, personal information about our customers and other information we have collected as described in this policy may be among the transferred business assets and may be shared with other parties.
	Gap Companies also may disclose personal information about you in order to: (1) protect the legal rights, privacy or safety of Gap Companies or our employees, agents and contractors; (2) protect the safety and security of visitors to our websites or other properties; (3) protect against fraud or other illegal activity or for risk management purposes; (4) respond to inquiries or requests from government or public authorities in any country in which we operate, including the U.S.; (5) permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; (6) enforce our Terms of Service; or (7) comply with the law or legal process.</p>
