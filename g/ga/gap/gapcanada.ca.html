<a name="q5"></a>
<h3>How do I make choices about personal information?</h3>

<p>Gap Companies and our brands want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us.

<h3>How do Gap Companies collect and use non-personal information?</h3>

<p>Non-personal information is information that does not identify you.  It may include information you have provided to us such as demographic data, for example, your gender, birthday, and personal interests.

<p>The Gap Companies may use non-personal information and share non-personal information with other third parties for any purpose.  The Gap Companies may combine non-personal information with personal information, such as combining your geographic location with your name, but if we do this the information will be treated by us as personal information for so long as it is combined.</p>

<h3>How do Gap Companies collect and use pixel tags and similar technologies?</h3>

<p>We use "pixel tags" (also called "web beacons" or "clear gifs"), which are tiny graphic images, and other similar technologies on our websites and in our emails.  Pixel tags help us analyze our customers' online behavior and measure the effectiveness of our websites and our advertising. We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information.  Pixel tags on our sites may be used to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the sites.  This information may include your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer.  We may also track certain information about the identity of the website you visited immediately before coming to our site.  Pixel tags and cookies in our emails may be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email message from us.  </p>

<p>We may combine the information we collect through cookies and pixel tags with other information we have collected from you.  This information may be used to improve our websites, to personalize your online experience, to tailor our communications with you, to determine the effectiveness of our advertising, to understand your preferences and for other internal business purposes.</p>

<p>We also work with third-party companies that use tracking technologies to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet.  These companies may collect information about your visits to our websites and your interaction with our advertising and other communications.  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having your information used by these companies, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>

<h3>How do Gap Companies collect and use IP addresses?</h3>

<p>Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).  This number is logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit our websites, along with the time of your visit and the pages that you visited.  It is also collected by pixel tags, as described above.  Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.  </p>

<p>We may use IP addresses for the same purposes for which we use personal information, as well as for calculating website usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering our websites and your use of our websites including providing opportunities to you and fulfilling your requests and purchases.  Except where otherwise required by law, we treat IP addresses, server log files and related information as non-personal information.</p>	

	<p class="anchor"><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

<a name="q10"></a>
<h3>How do I know personal information about me is secure?</h3>

<p>We do our best to provide you with a safe and convenient online experience.  We have in place physical, electronic, contractual, and managerial safeguards to help protect the security and privacy of your personal information from unauthorized access, acquisition or disclosure.  When you enter your personal information on our websites, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your personal information as it is transmitted to us. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Please do not send us sensitive information through email.  If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us as described in the section entitled, "How do I contact you?" below.  If you choose to notify us by physical mail this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem.</p>

<a name="q11"></a>
<h3>What about links to other websites?</h3>

<p>For your convenience and information, our websites may contain links to other sites, which may have privacy practices and policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the content or practices of any linked site. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of any site that you access through our sites.  The inclusion of a link to a third-party site on our websites does not imply that any of the Gap Companies endorses the site. </p>

<p class="anchor"><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>
