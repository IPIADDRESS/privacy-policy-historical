A cookie stored on your computer can be used to "remember" things like your password, or that you have already registered. This allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or registration. In addition, Gadget Guy™ may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional, marketing, or security purposes.</p><p><strong>What are Internet protocol addresses?</strong></p><p>An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). Gadget Guy™ may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, or to prevent our servers from being abused.</p><p><strong>What do I do if I want to correct or delete my personal information?</strong></p><p>If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your personal information, or would like to correct or request that we delete such personal information, please contact:</p><p>Gadget Guy Privacy Policy,<br>Attn: Privacy Policy Administrator, <br>120 Cathedral Street<br>Woolloomooloo NSW 2011<br>Australia</p><p>You can also contact us by e-mailing us at gadgetgrapevine@gadgetgroup.com.au</p><p><strong>How secure is my personal information?</strong></p><p>Gadget Guy™ has taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free from any alteration.

In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of personal information.</p><p><strong>What if I have a question or complaint?</strong></p><p>If you have any questions or wish to file a complaint, please feel free to e-mail us at privacyonline@gadgetguy.com.au.<br>or send a letter addressed to:</p><p>Gadget Guy Privacy Policy,<br>Attn: Privacy Policy Administrator,<br>120 Cathedral Street<br>Woolloomooloo NSW 2011<br>Australia</p><p>By using this website, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy.
