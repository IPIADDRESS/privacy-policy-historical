                <strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong><br>
                Peter Blasina will not collect or monitor any personal information 
                about you without your consent. The only personal information

                order to service your application. You do not have to provide 
                us with this information if you do not wish to do so. However,

              <p><strong>Use of Personal Information</strong><br>
                We will only use personal information which we might collect when<br>
                • we provide you with information about our products, services, 
                and/or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;special offers<br>
                • you have authorised us to do so.<br>
                • we have given you notification of the intended use and you have 
                not &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;objected to that use.<br>
                • we believe that the use is reasonably necessary to assist a law 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enforcement agency or an agency responsible for national security 
                in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the performance of their function.<br>
                • Peter Blasina is authorised, required or permitted by law to 
                disclose &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the information.</p>
              <p><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong><br>
                Any personal information you provide to Peter Blasina is strictly confidential. Peter Blasina will not reveal, disclose, sell, distribute, rent, license, 
                share or pass that information on to any third parties, other 
                than those who are: <br>
                contracted to Peter Blasina to keep the information 
                confidential; or <br>
                bound by a privacy policy which imposes similar restrictions to 
                Peter Blasina's privacy policy regarding 
                the handling of personal information. <br>
                We may disclose the personal information, other information or 
                data we collect from you for the purposes specified to you at 
                the time of collection or for another purpose if: <br>
                you would reasonably expect us to disclose it for that purpose; 
                and <br>
                that purpose is related to the purpose specified to you at the 
                time of collection.<br>
                If we wish to disclose any of this personal information, information 
                or data other than is set out above, we will not do so unless 
                we have your express consent to do so. Exceptions to this include: 
                <br>
                where Peter Blasina suspects that unlawful 
                activity is or has been engaged in and uses the personal information, 
                information or data to investigate the suspected unlawful activity; 
                or <br>
                the use is authorised by law or reasonably necessary to enforce 
                the law. These uses may include where Peter Blasina is required to provide information in response to subpoenas 
                or warrants or other legal process including requests from regulatory 
                authorities. <br>
                Security of Your Information<br>
                Peter Blasina will take all reasonable steps 
                to ensure that all information we collect, use or disclose is 
                accurate, complete, up-to-date and stored in a secure environment 
                accessed only by authorised persons.</p>
              <p>No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 
                totally secure. While we take all reasonable steps to protect 
                your personal information from misuse, loss or unauthorised access, 
                we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit 
                to us or receive from on-line from us and you do so at your own 
                risk. Once we receive your transmission, we take reasonable steps 
                to preserve the security of the information in our own system.</p>
              <p><strong>How to Access and Update Your Personal Information</strong><br>
                Our goal is to ensure that your personal information is accurate, 
                complete and up-to-date. You can always access your personal information 
                and content that you provide to us by contacting us. We will update 
                the relevant information. Exceptions to this include: <br>
                where providing access will pose an unreasonable impact on the 
                privacy of an individual; <br>
                your request for access is frivolous or vexatious; <br>
                where the information relates to existing legal proceedings between 
                Peter Blasina and you and the information 
                would not be discoverable in the process of those legal proceedings; 
                or <br>
                where providing access would be unlawful, may prejudice an investigation 
                of possible unlawful activity, may prejudice enforcement of laws 
                or denying access is specifically authorised by law.<br>
                If Peter Blasina does not allow you to access 
                your personal information, we will provide you with reasons for 
                our decision. If you believe that the personal information we 
                collect, use or disclose is inaccurate, incomplete or not up-to-date 
                but Peter Blasina does not agree with you, 
                we will post a statement of your claim where the information is 
                kept and accessed.</p>
              <p><strong>Changes to Privacy Policy</strong><br>
                Peter Blasina reserves the right to change 
                this privacy policy at any time by publishing the varied privacy 
                policy on the Gadgetguy website. A revised privacy policy 
                will only apply to data collected subsequent to its effective 
                date. You accept that by doing this, Peter Blasina has provided you with sufficient notice of the variation.</p>
