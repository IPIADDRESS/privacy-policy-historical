If you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that particular service or by not providing any information at that time.</p>

<p>With whom may your personal information be shared?<br>Gadget Guy™ may need to disclose your personal information to third party vendors to fulfill product orders or prizes, to process mailings, or to process, analyse, and/or store data. We will attempt to ensure that these entities do not use your personal information for any other purpose, and that they have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you if you are violating the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for a Gadget Guy site or product, or may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with Gadget Guy's rights or property, other users of a Gadget Guy site or product, or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities.</p>
<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Gadget Guy and will become part of our normal business records. As such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible. Similarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganisation, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Gadget Guy 's successor or assignee.</p>
<p>Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and as such we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Gadget Guy.

<p>What choices do I have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of my personal information?<br>Gadget Guy™ allows you to control the way that we use personal identifying information that we might obtain. At the time you provide personal information, Gadget Guy may give you the option of declining any future offers or information about new products, promotions, or services. In addition, many of the "mailings" Gadget Guy may send you, such as newsletters, have procedures within them to cancel the receipt of any future mailings.</p>
<p>If at any time you wish to opt out of having your personal information shared with third parties and/or receiving information from Gadget Guy (via e-mail or postal mail) about new products, services, or promotions, you can do so. You may contact us at: </p>
<p>Gadget Guy Privacy Policy,<br>Attn: Opt-Out Administrator, <br>22 Chard Rd<br>Brookvale NSW 2100<br>Australia</p>
<p>You can also contact us by emailing us at opt-out@Gadget Guy.com.au. Please indicate what publications or services you no longer wish to receive so that we may better address your needs.</p>
<p>What about Children?<br>Children Under 13<br>Once a child states that his/her age is under 13, we do not collect or store any personally identifiable information such as name, address, or email address.</p>
<p>Note to Parents <br>We recognise a special obligation to protect personal information about young children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when on-line. </p>
<p>Teenagers under the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage their parents to review this policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke our opt-out policy or to raise any concerns.</p>
<p>What are cookies and how do you use them?<br>Cookies are a feature of your web browser that allows websites to transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie stored on your computer can be used to "remember" things like your password, or that you have already registered. This allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or registration. In addition, Gadget Guy™ may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional, marketing, or security purposes.</p>
<p>What are Internet protocol addresses?<br>An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). Gadget Guy™ may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, or to prevent our servers from being abused.</p>
<p>What do I do if I want to correct or delete my personal information?<br>If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your personal information, or would like to correct or request that we delete such personal information, please contact:</p>
<p>Gadget Guy Privacy Policy,<br>Attn: Privacy Policy Administrator, <br>22 Chard Rd<br>Brookvale NSW 2100<br>Australia</p>
<p>You can also contact us by e-mailing us at privacyonline@gadgetguy.com.au </p>
<p>How secure is my personal information?<br>Gadget Guy™ has taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free from any alteration. As such, access to all personal information is strictly controlled. When credit card information is transmitted, for example, we use industry standard, SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of personal information.</p>
<p>What if I have a question or complaint?<br>If you have any questions or wish to file a complaint, please feel free to e-mail us at privacyonline@gadgetguy.com.au.<br>or send a letter addressed to:</p>
