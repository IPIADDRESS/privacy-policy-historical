											<p><br>
												<strong>Effective April 1, 2005: </strong>
											</p>
											<p><font color="darkorange"><strong>About GadBall.com GadBall.com</strong> </font>
												<br>
												(“GadBall”) is an online professional, personal and career community networking 
												service. Users of the GadBall website and service (“Users”) can post resumes on 
												the GadBall website and utilize the GadBall Resume Distribution technologies to 
												distribute their resumes to multiple internet employment sites from GadBall. 
												Users can also create personal profiles and link these to other Users through 
												User established networks.
											</p>
											<p>GadBall Users can view the profiles of other Users, communicate with friends 
												(both new and old) on the service, share photos, post messages and comments, 
												and describe their professional, personal, and career interests. To enrich and 
												facilitate the experiences of our Users we request and display some personal 
												information to other Users and visitors of GadBall, which allows Users to 
												identify each other and expand their networks. GadBall Users can edit their 
												User profile information at any time and control which internet employment 
												sites receive their information, and how other GadBall Users and GadBall 
												communicates with them.
											</p>
											<p>Upholding the privacy of our Users is paramount to GadBall. If you have any 
												questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:GadBallUserPrivacy@GadBall.com">
													GadBallUserPrivacy@GadBall.com</a>.
											</p>
											<p><font color="darkorange"><strong>Information Collection and Use by GadBall.com</strong>
													<br>
												</font>GadBall collects User submitted information such as name, eMail address, 
												and age to authenticate Users and to send notifications to Users relating to 
												the GadBall service. GadBall also collects other profile data including but not 
												limited to: personal interests, gender, age, work history, education and 
												occupation in order to assist Users in finding and communicating with each 
												other.
											</p>
											<p>GadBall automates the process of posting a resume on multiple internet 
												employment sites, and GadBall only transmits User resume information to 
												internet employment sites as requested by the User.
											</p>
											<p>GadBall logs non-personally identifiable information including IP address, 
												aggregate profile information, aggregate User data, aggregate resume content, 
												and browser type, from Users and visitors to the site. User IP addresses are 
												recorded for security and monitoring purposes. All of this data is used to 
												manage the website, track usage, display relevant advertising, and improve the 
												website services. This non-personally identifiable information may be shared 
												with third-parties to facilitate the provision of more relevant services and 
												advertisements to members.
											</p>
											<p>GadBall will never provide, share, rent or sell User-specific personal 
												information to any third parties, unless the User requests GadBall to transmit 
												this information on the User’s behalf.
											</p>
											<p>User Profile information including members' pictures, first names, and city, 
												state (or province) and country of residence are displayed to other Users and 
												visitors in order to facilitate User interaction in the GadBall social 
												networking community.
											</p>
											<p>EMail addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join 
												GadBall, to add Users to a User’s friends' network(s), and to send 
												notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting friends, 
												adding friends, and notifications, a User's eMail address is not shared or 
												displayed to people within a User's personal network. Users within a personal 
												network communicate on GadBall with each other through the GadBall service, 
												without disclosing their email addresses. Users' full names are never directly 
												revealed to other members. To facilitate searching and finding friends and 
												acquaintances on the service, GadBall allows Users to search for other members 
												using first and last name, email address, and schools and/or companies where 
												Users may have attended or worked.
											</p>
											<p>GadBall may also use a User's email address to send updates, notifications of 
												unread eMail messages, or a newsletter or news regarding the service. Users may 
												choose not to receive email of this type by changing their "notification" 
												settings on the User "Account Settings".
											</p>
											<p>GadBall or a partner may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on GadBall. 
												Participating Users may be asked to provide personal information including (but 
												not limited to) name, eMail address or home address or to answer questions in 
												order to participate. GadBall will make it clear at the point of collection who 
												is collecting the personal information; the User electing transfer of 
												information from GadBall is responsible for reviewing the Privacy Policy of the 
												recipient – this includes the resume distribution service of GadBall in which 
												the User specifically selects the sites to receive the User’s resume.
											</p>
											<p><strong><font color="darkorange">Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members
														<br>
													</font></strong>GadBall Users can invite friends to join the service by 
												sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. GadBall stores 
												the email addresses that Users provide so that the respondents may be added to 
												the User’s network, and to send the invitations, and also to send reminders of 
												the invitations. GadBall does not sell, rent, or trade these email addresses or 
												use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation 
												reminders (up to three [3] per email address). Recipients of invitations from 
												GadBall may contact GadBall to request the removal of their information from 
												our database.
											</p>
											<p>GadBall Users may also store email addresses of people they know in their 
												internal GadBall address book and may also choose to send invitations and other 
												communications to those addresses.
											</p>
											<p><strong><font color="darkorange">Use of Cookies
														<br>
													</font></strong>GadBall uses cookies to store User and Visitor preferences 
												and to record session information, for enhancement of the User experience 
												(including ensuring that visitors are not repeatedly offered the same 
												advertisements) and to customize newsletter, advertising, and Web page content 
												based on browser type and User information. Users may be able to configure 
												their browser to accept or reject all or some cookies, or notify the User when 
												a cookie is set. Each browser is different; it is the User’s responsibility to 
												check the "Help" menu of the User’s browser to learn how to change cookie 
												preferences. However, you must enable cookies from GadBall in order to use most 
												functions on the site. Users Please Note: GadBall allows 3rd party advertisers 
												that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their 
												cookies on your computer; this is a common internet practice. Each advertiser’s 
												use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the GadBall 
												Privacy Policy.
											</p>
											<p><strong><font color="darkorange">Links
														<br>
													</font></strong>GadBall contains links to sites. GadBall.com is not 
												responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When 
												linking to another site each User should read the privacy policy stated on that 
												site. Our privacy policy only governs information collected on GadBall.
											</p>
											<p><strong><font color="darkorange">Chat Rooms, Discussion Forums, Journals and WebLogs, 
														Message Boards, Classifieds and Public Forums
														<br>
													</font></strong>All Users, please be aware that whenever you voluntarily 
												post public information to Journals, WebLogs, Message Boards, Classifieds or 
												any other Public Forums that the information you post can be accessed by the 
												public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited 
												communications. For this reason we recommend that Users only post their resumes 
												to third party employment sites using the GadBall resume distribution service 
												and Users refrain from posting contact information of any type on any internet 
												website(s).
											</p>
											<p><strong><font color="darkorange">Correcting/Updating or Removing Information
														<br>
													</font></strong>GadBall Users may modify or remove any of their personal 
												information at any time by logging into their account, accessing the 
												appropriate features, and making the desired changes.
											</p>
											<p><strong><font color="darkorange">Email Choice/Opt-out </font></strong>
												<br>
												GadBall Users who no longer wish to receive notifications may choose not to by 
												logging into their account, accessing the appropriate features, and making the 
												desired changes. All notification emails from GadBall also include the above 
												instructions for opting-out of those communications in the future.
											</p>
											<p><strong><font color="darkorange">Third Party Advertising </font></strong>
												<br>
												Ads appearing on this Web site may be delivered to Users by GadBall or one of 
												our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may set cookies. 
												These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they 
												send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile 
												information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their 
												advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows 
												an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of 
												most interest to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by 
												GadBall and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
											</p>
											<p><strong><font color="darkorange">Security </font></strong>
												<br>
												GadBall User accounts are secured by member-created UserID’s and Passwords. 
												GadBall takes precautions to insure that User account information is kept 
												private. We use reasonable measures to protect User information that is stored 
												within our database, and we restrict access to User information to those 
												employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our technical 
												staff. Please note that no company, including GadBall, can guarantee the 
												security of User account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or 
												software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of User 
												information at any time. GadBall recognizes the trust of our Users is the 
												foundation for our long-term success; we review our security processes 
												regularly, and we attempt to take every commercially reasonable step to keep 
												our systems updated with the newest in security technologies to protect our 
												Users’ information.
											</p>
											<p><strong><font color="darkorange">Sharing and Disclosure of Information
														<br>
													</font></strong>GadBall Collects Except as described above, GadBall will 
												not disclose personal information to any third party without a User's explicit 
												permission unless required by law. GadBall reserves the right to transfer 
												personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that 
												information as a result of the sale of GadBall. For more information see the 
												"Changes in Our Privacy Policy" section below.
											</p>
											<p><strong><font color="darkorange">Changes in Our Privacy Policy
														<br>
													</font></strong>From time to time we may make changes to our privacy 
												policy. If we make changes, we will post them on our site to make Users aware 
												of what the changes are so Users will always be aware of what information we 
												collect, how we use it, and when we may disclose it. A User is bound by any 
												minor changes to the policy when she or he uses the site after those changes 
												have been posted. If, however, we are going to use Users' personally 
												identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at 
												the time of collection we will notify Users by posting a notice on our Web site 
												for 30 days.
