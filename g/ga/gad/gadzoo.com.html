        <p>
            <strong>Please read the following privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") carefully before using Gadzoo.com or any site powered by Legacy.com or Gadzoo.com (collectively, this "Site").</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>1. What This Privacy Policy Covers</h3>
        <p>
            </p><ol class="AlphaList">
                <li>
                    This Privacy Policy covers how Gadzoo.com, Inc. (collectively, "Gadzoo.com", "we",
                    "us", or "our") and all of its associated Web sites, products, and services (collectively, the "Services") 
                    treats user or personally identifiable information that the Services collect and receive.
                    If, however, you are accessing this Privacy Policy from a Web site operated in conjunction 
                    with one of our affiliates (listed at <a href="http://www.gadzoo.com/GadzooAffiliatesHome.aspx?state=All">http://www.gadzoo.com/GadzooAffiliatesHome.aspx?state=All</a>), the privacy policy of the Affiliate will govern 
                    unless such policy states otherwise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Subject to the above, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies
                    that Gadzoo.com does not own, operate or control, or to people that it does not employ
                    or manage. 
                </li>
            </ol>
        <p></p>
        <h3>2. General</h3>
        <p>
            In general, you can visit the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any
            information about yourself. Gadzoo.com does not collect personally identifiable
            information about individuals, except when specifically and knowingly provided by
            such individuals on interactive areas of the Site. "Personally Identifiable Information"
            is information that can be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate a single
            person, such as name, postal address, email address, phone number, and credit card
            number, among other information, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
            Any posting made while using the Site and Services can be viewed by the public and
            therefore is not considered "personal information" or "Personally Identifiable Information"
            and is not the type of information covered by this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

                            it cannot be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate a single person.
