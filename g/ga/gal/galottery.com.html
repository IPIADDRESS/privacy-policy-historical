If applicable, you can amend your previous preference by emailing an "unsubscribe email" to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@galottery.org">unsubscribe@galottery.org</a> or refer to our messages (including the email or other electronic communications sent to you by us) containing unsubscribe instructions. Once properly notified by you, we will take steps to stop using your information in this way or to modify your information, as applicable. Please allow us a reasonable period of time in order to satisfy your request. We note that without use of your information, we may not be able to provide you the Products or the same quality of Products you request. If you request removal of certain information from your account, then we will only retain copies of such information as necessary for us to comply with governmental orders, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, enforce any agreement you have entered into with us and as otherwise reasonably necessary for our business purposes, including compliance with all laws, rules, regulations, policies and procedures applicable to the Georgia Lottery Corporation and its Products. The foregoing does not constitute and we do not make any representation, express, implied or statutory, all of which are hereby expressly disclaimed, that all electronic copies of your information have been destroyed. For clarity, with respect to certain Products available through the Site, our ability to remove or stop using information submitted from you that is fundamental to your ability to receive or continue to receive and/or benefit from that Product is limited by all laws, rules, regulations, policies and procedures applicable to the Georgia Lottery Corporation and that specific Product.</p> <p>You also have the right to withdraw your consent to the use of the Geo-location Software at any time by taking certain steps to discontinue our access to the Geo-location Data; however, game Products will not be available to you through the Sites. Please see our <a href="https://www.mygalottery.com/en-us/footer/trmscndtions.html" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> for additional information and terms and conditions applicable to the Geo-location Software and Geo-location Data.</p> <h3>Use of Tools, "Cookies" and Links to Other Websites</h3> <p>This Site may use "cookies" or similar technology ("<b>Cookies</b>"). Cookies allow us to identify your device, but not you personally. You can set your web browser or mobile settings to refuse Cookies. However, if you do so, you may not be able to enjoy access and use all of the Products and services available to you on this Site.</p> <p>If you receive our email marketing, we may tailor the information we send you unless you tell us not to. This means we may use information we hold and Cookies to identify your individual Site search behavior, location and preferences. This will enable us to send you more personalized and relevant communications. You will be given the opportunity on every personalized communication to opt-out of this personalization except in circumstances where such personalization is required for the proper administration and operation of a specific Site section or Product or required by law.</p> <p>We and our third-party service providers and partners may collect information relating to analytics, customer trends and patterns and use Cookies and software tools to measure usage, session times and other analytical information. If you are making a purchase or an application for a Product, we may also use Cookies to keep track of the transaction from one area of the Site to another.</p> <p>In addition to the information we collect from Cookies, we may also obtain information which you provide to us electronically - for example, when you sign up for new Product updates or when you purchase Products, or otherwise when you communicate with us. In some cases, we retain both the cookie information and/or the information you provide to us electronically - for example, to complete a transaction you requested or to keep historical records of your past transactions. In other cases, we only retain the Cookie and/or electronic information you give us if you request us to do so for your use in subsequent sessions.</p> <p>An Internet Protocol address is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. Similar identifiers are available for other electronic devices used to communicate in other ways. When you visit this Site, we may view the applicable device identifier (which may include the city, domain address and service provider). We use this information, as well as geo-location information, to determine the general physical location of the device, understand the general location of visitors to this Site and verify eligibility to participate in certain features and offerings of the Site. We also may use this information to enhance this Site.</p> <p>Certain pages on our Sites contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow us and our third-party service providers and partners to obtain information such as the unique device identifier associated with the device that accessed or downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in Cookies set by the third-party.</p> <p>For third-party products and services available to you through this Site, we may share any or all of the information we collect with such provider to assist in your receipt of and access to such products and services. In such circumstances, you may be asked to accept the terms and policies of such provider. You should read all applicable terms and policies carefully to ensure you understand how such third party may use your information.</p> <h3>Children</h3> <p>This Site is not intended or authorized for, or designed to attract, use by any person under the age of 18. We recognize that areas of this Site are generally available for viewing by visitors to the Site; however, areas of the Site that require registration and the submission of personal information are intended solely for persons over 18. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect information from or about children or provide services to children on this Site. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we will not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. </p> <h3>Monitoring</h3> <p>To ensure that we carry out your instructions accurately, improve our products and services, provide security and enable compliance with all laws, rules, regulations, policies and procedures applicable to the Georgia Lottery Corporation and its Products, we may monitor and/or record: (1) telephone calls; and (2) transactions and activities on this Site. All recordings and other records are the sole property of the Georgia Lottery Corporation.</p> <h3>Security Statement</h3> <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information, including keeping your financial information private and safe. You acknowledge, however, that no transmission of data over the Internet or other electronic means can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, despite our efforts. Thus, while we will use and will require our applicable service providers to use commercially reasonable means consistent with general industry standards to secure information you transmit to us consistent with our legal requirements, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be intercepted by third parties.</p> <h3>Visiting This Website From Outside Of The United States</h3> <p>If you are visiting this Site or attempting to purchase Products from outside of the United States or otherwise contacting us from outside of the United States, please be aware that your personal information may be transferred to, stored or processed in the United States, where many of the service providers and servers related to this Site are located. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, but please be assured that we take steps to protect your privacy. Nothing in this Section is intended to expand or otherwise alter any provisions set forth or referenced in the Site <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mygalottery.com/en-us/footer/trmscndtions.html">Terms of Use</a> limiting access to and use of the Site and Products available on or through the Site to certain locations.</p> <h3>Changes to this Policy</h3> <p>We may change this Policy at any time. Any changes to this Policy will be posted on this Site or made available on request. The most recent version of the Policy is reflected by the version date located at the bottom of this Policy. This Policy is not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal right in or on behalf of any party. </p> <h3>Links to Other Websites</h3> <p>For your convenience, we may provide links to other third-party products and services that we do not control. Additionally, our iHOPEcard providers have separate terms and privacy policies located in the <a href="https://www.mygalottery.com/en-us/footer/gtech-pp.html" target="_blank">GTECH Privacy Policy</a> and the <a href="https://www.mygalottery.com/en-us/footer/wcterms.html" target="_blank">Wave Crest iHOPE™ Discover® Debit Card Cardholder Agreement</a>.
