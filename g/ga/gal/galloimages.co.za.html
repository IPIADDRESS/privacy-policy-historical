            you about our online collection and use of data. The terms of this policy apply
            to all Gallo Images websites, unless different terms are specified in a form or
            contract provided to you online or offline.</strong></p>

        <p>
            By using this site, you understand and agree to the terms of this policy. This site
            is owned by Gallo Images and may be accessed in South Africa and abroad. For data
            protection purposes, Gallo Images is the controller and, unless otherwise noted,
            is also the processor of data. Information collected may be retained, and may be
            stored, processed, accessed, and used in jurisdictions whose privacy laws may be
            different and less protective than those of your home jurisdiction.</p>

        <p><strong>Collection of Your Personal Information</strong></p>

        <p>
            When you visit this site, certain kinds of information, such as the website that
            referred you to us, your IP address, browser type and language, and access times,
            may be collected automatically as part of the site's operation. We also may
            collect navigational information, including information about the pages you view,
            the links you click, and other actions taken in connection with the site.</p>

        <p>
            We may combine your visit and navigational information with personal information
            that you provide. You may always choose not to provide personal information, but
            if you so choose, certain products and services may not be available to you. Personal
            information (e.g., your username and password, your name, your mailing address,
            email address, and phone number) is collected when you register. Additional personal
            information (e.g., your credit card number and billing address) is collected to
            process transactions or to provide you with products and services.</p>

        <p>
            Demographic information (e.g., your age, hobbies, income, gender, or interests)
            may also be collected and may be linked to your personal information.</p>

        <p><strong>Use of Your Personal Information</strong></p>

        <p>
            Gallo Images collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve
            our sites, to process your transactions, to provide customer service, to perform
            research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies,
            and to display content that is customized to your interests and preferences.</p>

        <p>
            We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send transaction-related
            communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, and purchase confirmations.
            We may also send you surveys or marketing communications to inform you of new products
            or services or other information that may be of interest. If you do not wish to
            receive marketing communications, you may follow the "unsubscribe" instructions
            included within each email communication. Please keep in mind that, if you choose
            not to receive marketing communications, you will continue to receive transactional
            or account communications (e.g., confirmation emails and account balance statements).</p>

        <p>
            Personal information collected by Gallo Images may be stored and processed in South
            Africa or any other country in which Gallo Images or its affiliates, subsidiaries,
            contractors or agents maintain facilities, and by using our sites or services, you
            consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. If you would
            like to exercise any of your data protection rights (including the right to have
            your personal information deleted), please contact us using the "Contact Information"
            below.</p>

        <p><strong>Sharing of Your Personal Information</strong></p>

        <p>
            Except as disclosed in this privacy policy, Gallo Images does not share your personal
            information with any outside parties.</p>

        <p>
            We may share your personal information within our corporate group, including with
            our subsidiaries and divisions, all of whom may use your information for the purposes
            disclosed herein.</p>

        <p>
            We may share your personal information with service providers who perform services
            on our behalf. For example, we may hire other companies to handle the processing
            of payments, to provide data storage, to host websites, to fulfill orders and shipments,
            to assist in direct marketing, to conduct audits, etc. Those companies will be permitted
            to obtain only the personal information they need to provide the service. They are
            required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from
            using it for any other purpose.</p>

        <p>
            Information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed
            as part of any merger, acquisition, or sale of the company and/or its assets, as
            well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which
            personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.
            We will notify you of such an occurrence as described in the "Changes to This
            Privacy Policy" section below.</p>

        <p>
            We reserve the right to disclose your personal information if required to do so

        <p><strong>Use of Cookies and Other Technologies</strong></p>

        <p>
            Gallo Images uses "cookie" to enable you to sign in to our services and
            to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is
            placed on your hard drive. Cookies contain information, including personal information,
            that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
            The information that cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit, your
            registration information, and your navigational and purchase history.</p>

        <p>
            Cookies offer you many conveniences. They allow us to identify registered users
            when they return to the site so that they can retrieve previous image search results,
            access Lightboxes and Clipbins and view their previous invoices. Cookies also save
            you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information.</p>

        <p>
            In some cases, our third-party service providers may use cookies on our sites. We
            have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the
            use of cookies by Gallo Images only, and does not cover the use of cookies by third
            parties.</p>

        <p>
            You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most browsers automatically accept
            cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If
            you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive
            features of our sites and services that depend on cookies.</p>

        <p>
            In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies, including single-pixel gifs
            (also known as web beacons) on our websites and in promotional e-mail messages or
            newsletters. These tiny electronic images assist us in determining how many users
            have visited certain pages or opened messages or newsletters. We do not use these
            images to collect personal information.</p>

        <p><strong>Security of Your Personal Information</strong></p>

        <p>
            The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally
            accepted industry standards to help protect your personal information. If a password
            is used to protect your account and personal information, it is your responsibility
            to keep your password confidential.</p>

        <p><strong>Forums &amp; Other Interactive Services</strong></p>

        <p>
            Our websites may include discussion forums or other interactive areas or services,
            including blogs, chat rooms, bulletin boards, message boards, online hosting or
            storage services, or other areas or services in which you or third parties create,
            post or store any content, messages, comments, materials or other items on the sites
            ("Interactive Areas"). If you use an Interactive Area, you should be aware
            that these areas are open to the public and any personal information you post or
            provide at registration may be viewable by others. We are not responsible for personal
            information you submit in connection with the Interactive Areas, nor are we responsible
            for how others might use that information, including to send you unsolicited messages.
            Interactive Area postings may be retained indefinitely. If at any time you would
            like to remove a posting, please email us at sales@galloimages.co.za. Keep in mind
            that removal of a posting from an Interactive Area does not mean that the posting
            will be deleted from our systems.</p>

        <p><strong>Email Referrals</strong></p>

        <p>
            If you choose to use our email referral services to tell a friend about our products
            or services (including images in your Lightbox, promotional campaigns, new websites,
            job postings, etc.), we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.
            We will use that information to send your friend a one-time email inviting him or
            her to visit the site and review the product or service you have selected. We may
            use a third-party provider to administer this function, but any such third party
            provider may only use the information submitted to facilitate this one-time email.
            Neither Gallo Images nor any third-party provider stores this information after
            the email is sent.</p>

        <p><strong>Children</strong></p>

        <p>
            We do not intend to solicit or collect personal information from anyone under the
            age of 18. If you are under 18, you should not use or enter information on this
            site, including without limitation, any Interactive Areas of the site.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Links</strong></p>

            We may link to websites, including those of our third-party content providers, that
            have different privacy policies and practices from those disclosed here. We assume
            no responsibility for the policies or practices of such linked sites, and encourage
            you to become acquainted with them prior to use.</p>

        <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>

            the policy. If there are material changes to this statement or in how Gallo Images
            will use your personal information, we will notify you by prominently posting a
