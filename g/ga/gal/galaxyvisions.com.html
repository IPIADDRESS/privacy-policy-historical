              <span class="fontprice">Inc., the owner of this website, has created 
              this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment 
              to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and 
              dissemination practices for this website: </span><span class="formfont">www.GalaxyVisions.com.

              <span class="linkfont">HOW WE USE IP ADDRESSES</span><br>
              <span class="fontprice">An IP address is a number that's automatically 
              assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers 
              -- the big computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically 
              identify your computer by its IP address. When guests request pages 
              from </span><span class="formfont">GalaxyVisions.com </span> <span class="fontprice">sites, 
              our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses 
              to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session 
              will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. </span><span class="formfont">GalaxyVisions.com</span><span class="fontprice">, 
              Inc. collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration. 
              We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, 
              and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help 
              identify you and your shopping cart. </span><br>
              <br>
              <span class="linkfont"> USE OF COOKIES</span><span class="title"> 
              </span><br>
              <span class="fontprice">What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of 
              information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive 
              for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for 
              customers by saving their passwords, purchases, and preferences 
              while they're at our site. The use of cookies is an industry standard 
              -- you'll find them at most major Web sites. By showing how and 
              when guests use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular 
              and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are 
              based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. 
              This information is most easily tracked with cookies. Our site uses 
              cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. We use cookies to deliver 
              content specific to your interests and to save your password so 
              you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. Cookies 
              are also required for customers to enjoy the Try It On™ feature. 
              A cookie lets the computers remember that you've registered, which 
              allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites. Similarly, 
              </span><span class="formfont">GalaxyVisions.com</span><span class="fontprice">, 
              Inc. uses a temporary cookie to track which products you've chosen 
              to purchase while shopping. The cookie expires once you're done 
              shopping. Letting it do the record keeping saves you the trouble 
              of entering information over and over again during a single visit. 
              If you decline this cookie, you may have difficulty ordering your 
              selections. GalaxyVisions.com, Inc. never uses cookies to retrieve 
              information from your computer that was not originally sent in a 
              cookie. GalaxyVisions.com, Inc. does not use information transferred 
              through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is 
              that information shared with any third parties whatsoever. </span><span class="formfont">GalaxyVisions.com</span><span class="fontprice">, 
              Inc. does not use cookies to identify specific individuals, except 
              in such cases as online shopping (see above). Most browsers are 
              initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours 
              to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, 
              it is possible that some parts of the site, such as the shopping 
              area, will not function properly if you do so. </span><br>

              <span class="linkfont">LINKS TO OTHER SITES</span><br>
              <span class="fontprice">Users should be aware that when they are 
              on </span><span class="formfont">GalaxyVisions.com</span><span class="fontprice">, 
              Inc. sites they could be directed to other sites that are beyond

              Inc. sites that take you outside our service. For example, if you 
              click on a link to an eye health-related site, the click takes you 
              off the </span><span class="formfont">GalaxyVisions.com</span><span class="fontprice">, 
              Inc. site. This includes links from sponsors and partners that may

              Inc.'s logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites 
              may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal 
              information. Always be aware of where you end up. We cannot be responsible 
              for your security on sites that are linked to ours. </span><br>
              <br>
              <span class="linkfont">INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span><br>
              <span class="fontprice">We collect several kinds of information 
              from customers and Associates. All of the information we collect 
              can be managed by the customer, meaning that the customer may enter 
              their private area of the site at any time and change or delete 
              their information. For example, we provide the convenience of securely 
              storing credit card information for customer, but this is not a 
              requirement to use the site or to purchase items. A customer can 
              also select or deselect the notification options at will. All of 
              the information we collect we use to enhance and improve a customer's 
              shopping experience, to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, 
              showing them content that we think they might be interested in, 
              and displaying the content according to their preferences. </span></p>
            <p><span class="fontprice">We do not share any of your information

              profile information with third parties or sponsors, generally companies 
              which sell consumer products and services about which our users 
              may be interested. The option for granting this permission is clearly 
              marked on the registration pages. We may also provide you with opportunities 
              at other times to receive information about additional products 
              and services, but we will never share your information with third 
              parties unless you grant us permission to do so. If you grant us 
              permission to share your information with third parties, and then 
              change your mind, you may revoke your permission by entering the 
              "My Details" area and changing the appropriate areas. Because we

              how the information you provide to us is used. This site gives users 
              the following options to cancel our service and not receive future 
              communications from us, direct that we not share their information 
              with third parties (in cases where users previously granted us permission 
              to share such information - we do not share users' personal information 
              with third parties without their permission), have us remove their 
              information from our database, and change their profile information.</span></p>

              This will automatically change the information contained in our
