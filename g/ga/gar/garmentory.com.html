<h1 class="upcase">Privacy Policy</h1>

<div class="legal">
  <p>Garmentory LLC (“Garmentory”, “us” or “we”) recognize the importance of your privacy.  Please read the following privacy policy to understand how we will treat your information in connection with our website located at www.garmentory.com and any successor, replacement or related website (collectively, “Website”), products, and services (which together are referred to here as the “Services”).</p>

  <p>Our Services may contain links to websites, products or services of other companies, and our Services may be available on the websites of other companies.  These and other third party websites, products and services are not controlled by us and are not subject to this privacy policy.  This privacy policy applies only to the practices of Garmentory in relation to our Services. We recommend that you read the privacy policies of any other websites, products or services that you visit or use.</p>

  <p class="section-header">Changes to this Privacy Policy and Acceptance</p>

  <p>We reserve the right to modify, alter, or update this privacy policy at any time.  We will post any changes on this page so please check this page frequently.</p>

  <p>This privacy policy was last updated on <span class="section-header">June 18, 2013.</span></p>

  <p>By providing information to us, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of that information in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

  <p class="section-header">Information We Collect</p>

  <p>What information we collect from visitors to our Website depends upon how visitors choose to interact with us through the Services. You can use most of our Services without providing any personal information to us. However, your election to use our full range of Services will involve providing personal information to us that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, mobile or other telephone number, email address, postal address or billing information.</p>

  <p>The following is a list of types of information we may collect and ways in which it could be collected:
  </p><ul>
    <li><span class="section-header">Information you provide.</span>  Some Services may require that you provide us with personal information as a condition of accessing and using those Services and some Services may give you the option to provide personal information.  If we offer services or promotions that require registration, we will ask you for personal information such as your name and email address. For purchases of products or any other fees that may apply to Services, we will request your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit card number. You may of course choose to submit information to us in various ways as well, such as when you contact us by email. In addition, we may combine information that you provide to us with information relating to you from other Services or from third parties.</li>

    <li><span class="section-header">Partners Web Sites.</span>  We may offer some Services through relationships with other companies and websites. For example, we may offer information and services on third party websites. Personal and other information that you provide to those websites may be sent to us.</li>

    <li><span class="section-header">Logged information.</span> We may automatically collect and store some information that you do not actively provide, such as your internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, the date and time of your visit, and the last website or webpage you visited.</li>

    <li>
      <p><span class="section-header">Cookies and other internet technology.</span>  When you visit our Website or use the Services, we may send one or more cookies (that is, small text files) to your computer or mobile device that uniquely identifies your browser. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can typically change your browser’s settings to refuse all cookies or notify you of a new cookie request.  However, some features of the Services will not function properly if cookies are disabled, deleted or refused. We may use other technology, such as clickstreams to, through and from our Website and web beacons (also sometimes called pixel tags or transparent GIFs) to, among other things, track use of our Services, and habits and preferences of our visitors.  During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.</p>
      <p>We may have relationships with partner websites and advertising companies that allow those companies to use cookies and other internet technology such as web beacons to track, among other things, use of our Services. These companies may combine this information with information about your visits to other sites and services for their use, and we may receive information from these companies about your use of our Services and third party websites. However, we do not provide your personal information to these companies as part of this relationship. It may, however, be possible that these companies could associate personal information that you provide to them when visiting their sites with the tracking data they receive in connection with your use of our Services.  Their use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policies and not this policy.</p>
      <p>Cookies placed by Garmentory or our partners may incorporate personal information, such as your user name and password, if any, although passwords will not be included unless you request that they be saved for automatic login.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>

  <p class="section-header">Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</p>

  <p>Personal and other information collected is used to provide our Services, for example to respond to or fulfill requests or enquiries, process orders and registrations, and communicate with you in general.</p>

  <p>We may also share personal and other information with our selected suppliers, service providers and partner websites in order to facilitate providing the Services to you including selling products to you. For example, we may provide such information to third parties that are involved with operating and maintaining the Services (including for example where another company provides website hosting, customer support or email message deployment services for us), performing business and sales analysis, improving the Services, and fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.</p>

  <p>We may collect and use non-personal information to display customized content and advertising, measure the usage and effectiveness of our Services and our online advertising and other content and activities, and improve our Services. Much of this information is gathered by us or other companies using cookies or other internet technologies, as described above under “Information We Collect.”</p>

  <p>We may also share non-personal information with other companies for marketing purposes, such as the display of targeted advertising with or in our Services or the websites or services of other companies. This information may include aggregated information such as usage statistics or demographic trends regarding our users or those of websites or services with which we have a business relationship. It may also include anonymous information regarding particular users, such as information about websites or pages visited by the particular user.</p>

  <p>We use and share personal information where you have chosen to allow us to use and share that information for specific purposes. For example, you may choose to allow us to share personal information when you enter a contest. You may also choose to allow us to share personal information with other companies for offer-marketing purposes, among other things.</p>

  <p>We disclose personal and other information if we have a good-faith belief that the disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, legal process or an enforceable government request; to enforce applicable Terms and Conditions for our Services; to detect, prevent or otherwise address illegal activity, fraud, or security issues; or to protect the property or safety of our users, Garmentory, or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>

  <p>In connection with a significant transaction involving Garmentory, such as an equity investment or merger or acquisition, we may transfer personal and other information to another company without your consent.</p>

  <p class="section-header">Social Media and Public Forums</p>

  <p>This privacy policy does not protect you when you participate in a public forum available on this Website (e.g., web chats, blogs and community forums). As a service to our users, Garmentory may feature bulletin boards and similar forums where users can share information or where users can post questions for others to answer. You should be aware that any information shared in a bulletin board, online discussion, or other public forum is public information and may be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties that do not adhere to our privacy policy. You should think carefully before disclosing any personal information in any public forum.</p>

  <p class="section-header">Your Choices</p>

  <p>If you have an account with us, you can review and update your account information (such as your name, user name, and contact information) online by logging into your account. We make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and the ability to correct the information if it is inaccurate or to delete it at your request if it is not required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We require users to identify themselves and the information they wish to access, correct, or remove before processing these requests, and we may decline to process requests that we believe in good faith are unreasonable or unduly burdensome (such as requests that are repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be impractical to satisfy).</p>

  <p>If you have an account with us, you can delete your account at any time by contacting us with that request. If you delete your account, we may retain certain information associated with your account for recordkeeping. Further, we generally do not remove information that you have made publicly available, and information that has already been provided to third parties as described in this privacy policy may be retained by those third parties and will be subject to their policies, and not this privacy policy.</p>

  <p>You should not use this Website if you disagree with how we intend to collect or use your information as set forth in this privacy policy.</p>

  <p class="section-header">Information Security</p>

  <p>If you send us electronic personal information, we will store it on our computers and/or other media we deem appropriate.  We employ firewalls and other electronic and physical measures to help keep your personal information secure.  You should be aware, however, that no transmission over the Internet, and no electronic data storage method, is 100% secure.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of the personal information you provide us either during its transmission or its storage on our computers.</p>

  <p class="section-header">Online Privacy of Children</p>

  <p>Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personal information from anyone under 18 years of age.</p>

  <p class="section-header">Contacting Us</p>

  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us by email at support@garmentory.com </p>
