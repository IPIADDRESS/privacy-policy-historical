<p align="center"><b>GCG Privacy Policy<br>

(Last Modified November 3, 2004)</b></p>



<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Garden City Group, Inc. ("GCG ") maintains and operates this website located at <a href="http://www.gardencitygroup.com">www.gardencitygroup.com</a> (the "Site"). We have created this Privacy Policy to let you know what information we may collect from you on the Site and how we may use that information.  Please take a moment to review the terms of our Privacy Policy.  By using the Site, you agree to accept the terms of our Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site. This privacy Policy applies only to information collected on the Site. 

<br>

<br>

<b>PERSONAL INFORMATION</b>

<br>

<br>

<u>Collection and Use</u>

<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may be required to provide personal information in order to access the Site and the information available on the Site.  In order to take advantage of certain features offered on the Site, you may need to provide personal information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number and other relevant information. In addition, parts of the Site relate to the particular class actions where we are administering the settlement of the case under the auspices of the court in which the case is pending.  For some settlements that we administer, you may be able to file your claim directly on the Site.  In such situations, you may be required to provide more extensive personal information, such as financial and other information about your claim.

<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you provide us with personal information, we will retain and use that information for the purpose for which it was submitted, such as e-mailing you claim information or processing your claim.  If you provide a resume to us through the Site, we may retain your resume in our files in order to contact you for current or future job openings.  We may also use personal information to customize the services we provide to you and to ensure compliance with GCG policies and applicable law. 

 <br><br>

<u>Disclosure of Personal Information</u>

<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for the limited situations discussed in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personal information with any third parties.  When we do share information, it is solely for the purpose of fulfilling your request, processing your claim or otherwise performing our noticing and/or administration services.  This may include providing information to the court in which the case is pending, the litigants in the case and their counsel. We do not rent, sell or otherwise disclose anyone's personal information for any other purpose.  

<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, GCG reserves the right to disclose visitor information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) GCG's rights or property, other visitors to the Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.  GCG  also reserves the right to disclose visitor information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

<br><br>

<b>AGGREGATE INFORMATION</b>

<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Site, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on.  We collect this information through the use of technologies such as "cookies" and "IP addresses," which are discussed in greater detail below.  We collect this information in order to determine which areas of the Site are visited most frequently and to enhance the Site for visitors.  We may also group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Site to our clients or other third parties, or in response to a government and/or legal request.  However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you or any other visitors to the Site. 

<br><br>

<u>IP Addresses</u>

<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the web.  Web servers, the big computers that "serve up" webpages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address.  GCG collects IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to third parties and to track the use of the Site.  When visitors request pages from the Site, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses.  It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us.  However, we reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor only when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Site's policies or to protect GCG, the Site, its visitors, or others. 

<br><br>

<b>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</b>

<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please be aware that when you are on the Site, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control.  There may be links to other sites from the Site's pages that take you outside our Site.  These other sites may send their own cookies (small text files stored in a user's browser) to visitors, collect data or solicit personal information.  The privacy policies of these other sites may be significantly different from this Privacy Policy.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your personal information collected there.

<br><br>

<b>SECURITY</b>

<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protecting the security of your personal information is very important to us.  When you transmit personal information from your PC to our servers, your information is protected by both a "firewall" (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information within our computer network) and industry standard SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.  Once we receive your transmission, we will take reasonable precautions to ensure its security on our systems.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while GCG  strives to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personal information.

<br><br>

<b>PRIVACY POLICY FOR CHILDREN</b>

<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 on the Site.  If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide any personal information to us.  If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.

<br><br>

<b>CHANGES TO THESE TERMS</b>

<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of this Privacy Policy may change from time to time.  We will notify you of any material changes to this Privacy Policy by posting a notice on the homepage of the Site for a reasonable period of time after such changes are made that this Privacy Policy has been updated, and by changing the "Last Modified" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.  We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes.  Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.

<br><br>

<b>DISCLAIMER</b>

<br><br>

EXCEPT WHERE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED OTHERWISE, THE MATERIALS ON THE WEBSITE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." GCG HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, GUARANTIES, AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID. GCG MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, GUARANTIES, OR CONDITIONS AS TO THE QUALITY, SUITABILITY, TRUTH, ACCURACY, OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OF THE MATERIALS CONTAINED ON THE WEBSITE. IN NO EVENT WILL GCG BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS USE, OR DATA OR FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT OR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORT.
