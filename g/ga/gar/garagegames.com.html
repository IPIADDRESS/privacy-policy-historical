<h2>Privacy Policy...</h2>
GarageGames values the privacy of the people who visit our site. The
following is our detailed privacy policy, if you have any questions,
feel free to e-mail <a href="mailto:info@garagegames.com">info@garagegames.com</a> with your questions.
 
<h3>GarageGames Privacy Policy</h3> 
<div class="indent">
<p>GarageGames Corporation ("GarageGames") provides a variety of
online services, from electronic commerce to downloadable files. Because
the success of GarageGames is dependent on building and maintaining
goodwill with our customers, we are committed to implementing measures
designed to protect the privacy of those using our services. Moreover,
we see it as our responsibility to set examples and help establish the
standards for privacy on the Internet.</p>

<p>Although GarageGames respects the privacy of all those who visit our
web site and use our online services, we do collect information from our
members and visitors. This Privacy Policy governs your interaction with
the GarageGames web site, and your registration for and use of
GarageGames' online services. Except as set forth within this
Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service and other published guidelines,
we do not release personally identifiable information about out members
and visitors without their permission. </p>

<p>Please note that GarageGames reviews its privacy practices from time
to time, and that those practices are therefore subject to change. We
ask that you bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure
continuing familiarity with the most current version of our Privacy
Policy. To contact GarageGames about privacy issues, to report a
violation of our Privacy Policy, or to raise any other issue, please
e-mail us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@Garagegames.com">webmaster@Garagegames.com</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>The information we gather</h3> 
<div class="indent">
<p>GarageGames gathers two types of information about users:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Non-personally identifiable information: When visitors come to our
web site, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other
things, which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited,
and which hyperlinks were "clicked." Collecting such information
involves the logging of IP addresses, operating system and browser
software used by each visitor to the GarageGames web site. Although
such information is not personally identifiable, we can determine from
the IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider and the geographic
location of his or her point of connectivity.</p>

<p>The non-personally identifiable information we collect helps us identify
the most popular areas of our web site and determine the effectiveness
of our promotional activities. In addition, we may disclose some of this
information to advertisers to inform them of the number of people who
have seen and/or clicked through their advertisements. </p>

<p>For the same purposes, we may use "cookies" - that is, small text files
placed on your computer's hard drive - to help us determine the type of
content and sites to which you link, the length of time you spend at any
particular area of the GarageGames site, and the GarageGames
services you choose to use. Cookies also tell us which advertising you
have seen on our site. Essentially, cookies are your identification
cards for the GarageGames computers, or servers, that placed them
there. Cookies are only read by the server that placed them, and are
unable to execute any code or virus. </p>

<p>Cookies allow GarageGames to serve you better and more efficiently,
and to personalize your experience at GarageGames' web site.
Nevertheless, you should be able to control how and whether cookies will
be accepted by your web browser. For more information on how to do so,
please refer to the documentation accompanying your browser. </p>

</li><li><p>Personally identifiable information: In certain areas of the
GarageGames web site - for example, when registering to become an
GarageGames member - we request, but do not require, that you
provide us with personally identifiable information (including, for
example, first name, surname, street address, email address, telephone
number, and when applicable, credit card information). </p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
children (defined herein as minors younger than thirteen years of age)
without obtaining parental consent. Before registering for membership
with GarageGames, we ask that children have their parents read our
Privacy Policy. Before and during the registration process, we encourage
children to include a parent or guardian in the process. </p>
</li></ol>

<p>GarageGames does not control the acts of its members or visitors.
All members and visitors should be aware that, when they disclose
personally identifiable information in a bulletin board, chat room,
guestbook, or other forum, the information may be collected and used by
others to send that person unsolicited email from other parties outside
GarageGames. In the event that you encounter any GarageGames
user who is improperly collecting or using information about you or
other users, please contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@Garagegames.com">webmaster@Garagegames.com</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>How we use (and do not use) the information we gather</h3> 
<div class="indent">
<p>Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways
GarageGames uses the information that it gathers. Keep in mind that,
while GarageGames encourages all third parties involved - including
but not limited to its affiliates and advertisers - to adhere to our
policies regarding the privacy of our visitors and members and to
otherwise handle personal information in a responsible manner, we cannot
and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of
third parties, including the manner in which they use information
received either from GarageGames or independently. Nevertheless, in
the event you encounter any third party associated with, or who claims
association with GarageGames who you feel is improperly collecting
or using information about you, please contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@Garagegames.com">webmaster@Garagegames.com</a>; we
will be happy to forward your message to the third party.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How we use (and do not use) non-personally identifiable information:
We use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to
build higher quality, more useful online services by performing
statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of
our members and visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests
regarding specific areas of the GarageGames web site. We provide
statistical information based on this data to advertisers, affiliates,
and other current and potential business partners. We also use the
aggregate data to inform these third parties as to the number of people
who have seen and clicked on links to their web sites. </p>

<p>The GarageGames web site contains links to other Internet web sites,
including co-branded or other affiliated sites which may or may not be
owned or operated by GarageGames. Unless otherwise explicitly
stated, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content
of such web sites, including such sites' use of any information (such as
IP number, browser type, or operating system) collected when visitors to
the GarageGames web site click through links to those sites. Even
though such information might not identify you personally, we strongly
encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of those
sites.<!--0-->

</p></li><li><p>How we use (and do not use) personally identifiable information:
GarageGames provides notice to potential GarageGames registrants
that personally identifiable information will be collected during the
registration process. Such notice is provided simultaneously with your
GarageGames registration; moreover, this Privacy Policy itself
serves as notice that such information is collected under those
circumstances. Although you may not "opt out" of the registration
process if you wish to become a GarageGames member, you may choose
to "opt out" of receiving promotional materials from GarageGames
and/or its affiliates, advertisers, or other business partners. If you
do not "opt out" of receiving such promotional materials,
GarageGames reserves the right to release any personally
identifiable registration information regarding you to third parties who
provide goods or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We
will not release your credit card information to third parties unless
necessary to complete a transaction between you and such a third party.
If you decide that you would like to discontinue receiving promotional
information from such third parties, please contact those third parties
directly, or contact GarageGames at <a href="mailto:info@Garagegames.com">info@Garagegames.com</a>.</p>

<p>GarageGames limits its own e-mail solicitations to those customers
who have not "opted out" of receiving such communications. The
solicitations are limited in that they, among other things, will clearly
indicate the originator of the e-mail and provide the customer with a
method of "opting out" of receiving future communications of a similar
nature. </p>

<p>In addition, GarageGames sometimes uses individual data to "target"
advertising - to decide which advertisements and sponsor messages to
show to which members. As an example, if Sponsor Co. wishes to display
their advertising only to female GarageGames members,
GarageGames uses member registration data to ensure that Sponsor
Co.'s ads are displayed only to female members. </p>

<p>Finally, GarageGames may use individual members' data to
"pre-populate" forms which are displayed for the purpose of collecting
individual data by GarageGames and/or its sponsors. In no case does
pre-populating a form automatically transfer any data to any advertiser
or third party. Only if the member voluntarily requests that such data
be transferred will any transfer take place - for example, if/when a
member clicks a "submit form" button or other button. </p>

<p>We reserve the right to release information contained within our access
logs concerning any visitor or member when that visitor or member is in
violation of our Terms of Service or other published guidelines, or
partakes (or is reasonably suspected of partaking) in any illegal
activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, and to
release such information in response to discovery requests. We cooperate
with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our
servers or services for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to
report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for
investigation or prosecution.</p>

<p>If and when GarageGames sponsors promotions or sweepstakes, or third
parties sponsor promotions or sweepstakes in conjunction with
GarageGames, either GarageGames or the third party will post
relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration
area for the promotion or sweepstakes. That privacy information, to the
extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, will govern that
particular promotion or sweepstakes. </p>
</li></ol></div>

<h3>Changing or deleting personal information</h3> 

<div class="indent">
<p>If you would like to have your personally identifiable information
removed from GarageGames' database, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:webmaster@Garagegames.com">webmaster@Garagegames.com</a>, and we will use reasonable efforts to comply with
your request. Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual
information that will remain within GarageGames databases, access
logs, and other records, which may or may not contain such personally
identifiable information. The residual information will not be used for
commercial purposes; however GarageGames reserves the right, from
time to time, to recontact former customers or users of GarageGames.</p>
