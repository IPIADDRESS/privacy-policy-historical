              <p><span class="heading10">What does GARMIN do to protect the data 
                I transmit to your Online Store?</span> <br>
                GARMIN's online store, shop.garmin.com, uses industry standard 
                Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption 
                of personal information such as your name and address, as well 
                as critically sensitive information such as your credit card number. 
                GARMIN uses <a href="http://www.verisign.com/">VeriSign</a>, an 
                industry leader in online security and site verification, to ensure 
                our site's security. GARMIN's website shop.garmin.com is also 
                registered with site identification authorities so that your browser 
                can confirm our identity before any personal information is sent. 
                In addition, our secure servers protect this information using 
                advanced firewall technology. </p>
              <p><span class="heading10">What do you do after you get an order 
                from me? </span><br>
                Not only does GARMIN protect your purchase-related information 
                as it is transmitted to our servers, but we also secure the servers 
                themselves to help prevent unauthorized access to the data after 
                it is in our hands. We have comprehensive security measures in 
                place to protect our Internet servers, as well as our internal 
                corporate computer resources, from loss, misuse, and alteration. 
                In addition, your credit card and billing information cannot be 
                read as it travels to our ordering system. </p>
              <p><span class="heading10">What can I do to help make sure online 
                shopping works correctly? </span> <br>
                To help ensure that these measures are effective in preventing 
                unauthorized access to your private information, you should be 
                aware of the security features available to you through your browser. 
                You should use a security-enabled browser to make purchases at 
                GARMIN's online store.<span class="heading10"> Please note: </span>If 
                you do not use a SSL-capable browser, you are at risk for having 
                data intercepted. GARMIN will not be responsible for any compromise 
                of data that is intercepted due to the customer's use of an unsecured 
                browser. </p>
              <p>Most browsers have the ability to notify you if you change between 
                secure and insecure communications, receive invalid site identification 
                information for the site you are communicating with, or send information 
                over an unsecured connection. We recommend that you enable these 
                browser functions to help ensure that your communications are 
                secure. You can also monitor the URL of the site you are visiting 
                (secure URLs begin with https:// rather than the normal http://), 
                along with the security symbol of your browser (an open or closed 
                padlock in Netscape or a broken or complete key in Internet Explorer) 
                to help identify when you are communicating with a secure server. 
                You can also view the details of the security certificate of the 
                site to which you are connected. We encourage you to use this 
                to check the validity of any site you connect to using secure 
                communications. </p>

                use, and disclosure practices. Please consult each site's policies 
                and practice. GARMIN is not responsible for the policies or practices 
                of third parties. The information practices of those websites

              <p><span class="heading10">Do you offer opt-out or opt-in services? 
                </span><br>
                There are no opt-in or opt-out selections on our website. GARMIN 
                does not have any mail lists or other systems in place that are 
                traditionally associated with these service options. However, 
                we may implement electronic newsletters or similar broadcast mail 
                systems in the future. If we do, these services will only be offered 
                on an opt-in basis. Currently, we do not mass e-mail or provide 
                such information to outside mailing lists. </p>

                GARMIN does maintain responsibility for and authority over all 
                information contained on its website. However, we may post links 
                to sites that we do not control. GARMIN is not responsible for

              <p><span class="heading10">What about testimonial copy?</span><br>
                Testimonials submitted to stories@garmin.com may be used on the 
                website and in promotional newsletters and other publications. 
                If you submit communications—either written or electronic—to 
                GARMIN, please indicate if you do not want your submission published 
                or if you would prefer us to use your initials rather than your

              <p><span class="heading10">What's your policy regarding children's 
                use of your website? </span> <br>
                While GARMIN encourages everyone to visit our site and learn about 
                our company and GPS technology and applications, we have no desire 
                to collect information from those under the age of 18. Any instance 
                of personal information about a minor being collected would be 
                purely accidental and unintentional. If a minor would like to 
                submit information to GARMIN, we ask that the child's parent submit 
                the information on his or her behalf. We strongly encourage parents 
                to take an active role in their children's use of the Internet 
                and to take appropriate steps to ensure a positive and safe experience.
