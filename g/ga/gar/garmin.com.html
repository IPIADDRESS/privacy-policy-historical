						<h3>Garmin® International's Privacy/Security Statement </h3>
						<p>Effective Date: 08/29/2006</p>
						<p>Garmin International respects your right to privacy and shares your concern  about the security of any data you may submit to Garmin’s website. The  following statement discloses the guidelines Garmin has established for  protecting the information you provide to Garmin during your visit to http://www.garmin.com/.</p>
						<p>This website is owned, operated, and maintained by:<br>
						Garmin International Inc.<br>
						1200 E 151st Street.  Olathe, KS   66062<br>
						Phone: 913-397-8200<br>
						Fax: 913-397-8282<br>
						E-mail: <a href="mailto:webmaster@garmin.com">webmaster@garmin.com</a></p>
						<p>Garmin  is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to  build user’s trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair  information practices. This privacy  statement covers the site <a href="http://www.garmin.com/">http://www.garmin.com</a> and information collected on Garmin’s blog website. Because Garmin wants to demonstrate its  commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices  and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
						<p>If  you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first  contact Garmin by e-mail at <a href="mailto:webmaster@garmin.com">webmaster@garmin.com</a>. If you do not receive acknowledgement of your  inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should  contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>.  TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison between  you and Garmin to resolve your concerns.</p>
						<p>The TRUSTe  program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and  does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded  from this site.</p>
						<p>Garmin complies  with the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce  regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.</p>
						<p><strong>What information about me does Garmin collect and how is it used? </strong><br>
						Garmin only collects personal information about you if you voluntarily choose  to share it with Garmin. Garmin does not share, rent or sell information  concerning Garmin’s customers to third parties in ways other than disclosed in  this privacy statement.</p>
						<p>When you visit garmin.com, unless you voluntarily disclose personal  information, Garmin does not collect or store any personally identifiable  information about you. However, Garmin does collect and store certain data  about the use of Garmin’s website. This is done on an anonymous basis, and the  same information is collected for all hits on Garmin’s servers. The information  collected may include the time and date you visited the site, the pages you looked at, and your IP address and domain name. Garmin does not link this  information to anything personally identifiable to you. Garmin only uses this  information for system administration and to help Garmin develop ideas about  how it might tailor its site to improve your visit. This information is not  rented or sold to third parties and will not be used by Garmin to contact you in any way.</p>
						<p>When you visit shop.garmin.com, a cookie will be stored on your computer.  Cookies are small text files that help Garmin keep track of your shopping cart  as you move through Garmin’s store, and they only contain the necessary  information to associate a shipping ID on your computer with the orders in the  "shopping cart" table on Garmin’s server. <strong>Please note:</strong> At the present time, you cannot purchase from shop.garmin.com with the  "cookies" feature shut off on your browser. If you place an order at  shop.garmin.com or you request an unlock code for a MapSource® CD at the  garmin.com MapSource unlock pages, Garmin will request and collect personal  information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone  number, credit card number, and expiration date. This information is used to  fill your order or process your request for a MapSource unlock code, as the  case may be.</p>
						<p>On  the garmin.com website and the garmin.blogs.com website, there are several  opportunities for you to share personal information about yourself with Garmin.  This may include information about you such as your interests, your name, and  your mailing address and e-mail address. Submission of this information is  strictly voluntary.&nbsp; If you choose to  share any personal information with Garmin, Garmin may store it and use it for  internal marketing research and other marketing purposes, including e-mailing  you with special promotions and other programs of interest. Garmin may also, in the event that this  information is collected as part of a warranty registration process, use this  information to contact you later. If the information is sent as part of a  website evaluation, Garmin may also use the information to contact you about  your comments. However, Garmin does not share, rent or sell your information to  another company in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement. In the  case of MapSource Unlock data, certain customer information, such as name and  address, may be shared with Garmin’s data providers. These providers currently  use this information for internal demographic analysis. These providers may,  unless you opt-out during the Unlock process, use this information to inform  you when new data is released or new products become available.</p>
						<p>You may decide to send Garmin personally identifying information in an  e-mail message which might contain information or inquiries about Garmin’s  products or services. Garmin will use this information to identify you as a  Garmin customer and to respond to the electronic mail. Garmin will only use the  information obtained to resolve the issue identified in the e-mail. Garmin  never sells e-mail addresses. You may change your personal information by  contacting either Product Registration or Cartography Registration (for  MapSource products).</p>
						<p>Garmin may transfer personal information that you share within the Garmin group of companies in order to provide the products that you request. Except as specified above, Garmin will only share your personal information with third  parties if: </p>
							<ul>
                          		<li>Garmin has your consent; </li>
						 		<li>Garmin determines that it is required to do so by law; </li>
						  		<li>Garmin finds that you are in breach of its terms and conditions or any of its policies or usage guidelines for specific products or services; </li>
						  		<li>it is necessary in Garmin’s opinion to do so to prevent, investigate, detect or prosecute criminal offences or attacks on the technical integrity of Garmin’s site(s) or its network; </li>
						  		<li>it is necessary in Garmin’s opinion to do so to protect the rights, property, or safety of Garmin or its employees, the users of its website(s), or the public; or</li>
						  		<li>it is necessary to fulfill your product or service order. Garmin may use an outside shipping company to fulfill your order, and a credit card processing company to process your credit card information as required for your order and to ensure that your transaction is secure. These companies do not retain, share, store or use your personally identifiable information for any other purposes. &nbsp;</li>
					  		</ul>
						<p><strong>What does Garmin do to protect the data I transmit to Garmin’s  Online Store? </strong><br>
						Garmin's online store, shop.garmin.com, uses industry standard Secure Sockets  Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of personal information such  as your name and address, as well as critically sensitive information such as  your credit card number. Garmin engages a company that is an industry leader in  online security and site verification to ensure the security of Garmin’s site. Garmin's website shop.garmin.com is also  registered with site identification authorities so that your browser can  confirm Garmin’s identity before any personal information is sent. In addition,  Garmin’s secure servers protect this information using advanced firewall technology.</p>
						<p><strong>What does Garmin do after it gets an order from me?</strong><br>
						Not only does Garmin protect your purchase-related information as it is  transmitted to Garmin’s servers, but Garmin also secures the servers themselves  to help prevent unauthorized access to the data after it is in Garmin’s hands. Garmin  has comprehensive security measures in place to protect its Internet servers,  as well as its internal corporate computer resources, from loss, misuse, and  alteration. In addition, your credit card and billing information cannot be  read as it travels to Garmin’s ordering system.</p>
						<p><strong>What can I do to help make sure online shopping works correctly?</strong><br>
						To help ensure that these measures are effective in preventing unauthorized  access to your private information, you should be aware of the security  features available to you through your browser. You should use a  security-enabled browser to make purchases at Garmin's online store. Please  note: If you do not use a SSL-capable browser, you are at risk for having data  intercepted. Garmin will not be responsible for any compromise of data that is  intercepted due to the customer's use of an unsecured browser.</p>
						<p>Most browsers have the ability to notify you if you change between secure  and insecure communications, receive invalid site identification information  for the site you are communicating with, or send information over an unsecured  connection. Garmin recommends that you enable these browser functions to help  ensure that your communications are secure. You can also monitor the URL of the  site you are visiting (secure URLs begin with https:// rather than the normal  http://), along with the security symbol of your browser (an open or closed  padlock in Netscape or a broken or complete key in Internet Explorer) to help  identify when you are communicating with a secure server. You can also view the  details of the security certificate of the site to which you are connected.  Garmin encourages you to use this to check the validity of any site you connect  to using secure communications.</p>
						<p><strong>If my credit card company determines that there are fraudulent  charges on my account, what should I do?</strong><br>
						If your credit card company determines that there are fraudulent charges on  your account that are the result of your purchase at shop.garmin.com and they  hold you liable for the unauthorized changes, please contact Garmin  immediately. You can contact Garmin by e-mail at mailto:websales@garmin.com or  postal mail:</p>
						  Garmin International Inc.<br>
						  1200 E. 151st St.<br>
						  Olathe, KS 66062<br>
						  Attn: Webmaster (credit card fraud)<br>
						  <p>You should carefully review security/privacy policies of any third party  sites accessible from Garmin’s site. Other sites accessible through Garmin’s  website have their own policies and data collection, use, and disclosure  practices. Please consult each site's policies and practice. Garmin is not  responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. The information  practices of those websites linked from Garmin’s site are not covered by this  Privacy/Security Policy. These other sites may send their own cookies to users,  collect data, or solicit personal information.</p>
						  <p><strong>Does Garmin offer opt-out or opt-in services?</strong><br>
						  When registering a Garmin product on the website, you will receive emails from  Garmin regarding updates on only the products you are registering. You may initially opt-out of receiving these  emails during the product registration process. As stated above, Garmin may also send you special promotions and other  programs of interest via email. If you choose to stop receiving these emails in  the future, please follow the unsubscribe instructions within each email  communication or send an email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@garmin.com">webmaster@garmin.com</a>. Garmin will not provide or share any  mailing lists or other information about you to another company or service for  promotional purposes.&nbsp;Any service related emails (to confirm a purchase,  etc.) generally do not offer an unsubscribe as they are necessary to provide  the service you requested.</p>
						  <p><strong>What  if information I have previously submitted has changed? </strong><br>
						  If you need to change the information you have sent to Garmin on a product  registration, please e-mail <a href="mailto:warranty@garmin.com">warranty@garmin.com</a>.  If you need to correct, amend or delete  submitted information that is inaccurate please contact Garmin at <a href="mailto:webmaster@garmin.com">webmaster@garmin.com</a>. Garmin will respond to  your email request within 10 -15 business days.</p>
						  <p><strong>Is Garmin responsible for all of the material I see on Garmin’s  website? </strong><br>
						  Garmin does maintain responsibility for and authority over all information  contained on its website. However, Garmin may post links to sites that Garmin  does not control. Garmin is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these sites.</p>
						  <p><strong>What about testimonial copy?</strong><br>
						  Testimonials submitted to stories@garmin.com or to Garmin’s Blog site at <a href="http://garmin.blogs.com/">http://garmin.blogs.com</a> may be used on the  website or the Blog site and in promotional newsletters and other publications.  If you submit communications—either written or electronic—to Garmin, please  indicate if you do not want your submission published or if you would prefer Garmin  to use your initials rather than your full name.</p>
						  <p><strong>What about Garmin’s Blog Site? </strong><br>
						  Garmin  maintains a relationship with an outside service provider to administer the  online Blog feature offered through Garmin’s site at <a href="http://garmin.blogs.com/">http://garmin.blogs.com</a>. This website maintains the look and feel of  the <a href="http://www.garmin.com/">www.garmin.com</a> website. When posting a  comment you will be asked to register for the blog. The personal information submitted here,  although collected on the 3rd party provider website, is wholly  governed by Garmin’s privacy statement. The 3rd party provider does not access nor use the information submitted here for any secondary purposes.</p>
						  <p>If you use the Blog feature, you should be aware that any personally  identifiable information you submit in the comment field can be read,  collected, or used by other users of these forums indefinitely, and could be  used to send you unsolicited messages.&nbsp; Garmin  is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to  submit in this field.</p>
						  <p><strong>What's Garmin’s policy regarding children's use of Garmin’s website?</strong><br>
						  While Garmin encourages everyone to visit its web site and learn about the company  and GPS technology and applications, Garmin has no desire to collect  information from those under the age of 18. Any instance of personal  information about a minor being collected would be purely accidental and  unintentional. If a minor would like to submit information to Garmin, Garmin  asks that the child's parent submit the information on his or her behalf. Garmin  strongly encourages parents to take an active role in their children's use of  the Internet and to take appropriate steps to ensure a positive and safe  experience.</p>
						  <p><strong>Where can I learn more about using the Internet and protecting my  privacy?</strong> <br>
						  The United States Federal Trade Commission has a web page <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/index.html">http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/index.html</a> devoted to providing you with information about protecting your privacy online.  Garmin encourages you to familiarize yourself with the concepts discussed on  this page.</p>
						  <p><strong>Privacy/Security Policy changes</strong><br>
						  If Garmin makes changes to any terms or conditions of this Privacy/Security  Policy, these changes will be posted on Garmin’s websites in a timely manner.
