                In the case of MapSource Unlock data, certain customer information

                To help ensure that these measures are effective in preventing 
                unauthorized access to your private information, you should be 
                aware of the security features available to you through your browser. 
                You should use a security-enabled browser to make purchases at 
                Garmin's online store.<span class="heading10"> Please note: </span>If 
                you do not use a SSL-capable browser, you are at risk for having 
                data intercepted. Garmin will not be responsible for any compromise 
                of data that is intercepted due to the customer's use of an unsecured 
                browser. </p>
              <p>Most browsers have the ability to notify you if you change between 
                secure and insecure communications, receive invalid site identification 
                information for the site you are communicating with, or send information 
                over an unsecured connection. We recommend that you enable these 
                browser functions to help ensure that your communications are 
                secure. You can also monitor the URL of the site you are visiting 
                (secure URLs begin with https:// rather than the normal http://), 
                along with the security symbol of your browser (an open or closed 
                padlock in Netscape or a broken or complete key in Internet Explorer) 
                to help identify when you are communicating with a secure server. 
                You can also view the details of the security certificate of the 
                site to which you are connected. We encourage you to use this 
                to check the validity of any site you connect to using secure 
                communications. </p>

                While Garmin encourages everyone to visit our site and learn about 
                our company and GPS technology and applications, we have no desire 
                to collect information from those under the age of 18. Any instance 
                of personal information about a minor being collected would be 
                purely accidental and unintentional. If a minor would like to 
                submit information to Garmin, we ask that the child's parent submit 
                the information on his or her behalf. We strongly encourage parents 
                to take an active role in their children's use of the Internet 
                and to take appropriate steps to ensure a positive and safe experience.
