<b> 
<p>II. Summary</p>
</b> 
<p>Here's the deal. The internet has a lot of great advantages, and it enables 
  people to interact in many different ways. As a result of interaction, data 
  and information can be obtained from you. We only want to use that information 
  in a ways that are known by you in advance, and in ways that are acceptable 
  to you. </p>
<p>The information that may be collected from you generally falls into three (3) 
  categories.</p>
<ul type="SQUARE">
  <ul type="SQUARE">
    <li>Anonymous electronic footprints. When our computers are "communicating" 
      with another, that is, when you are surfing our pages, our computer identifies 
      your computer and accumulates certain information, such as which pages you 
      visited, and how long you were there. But we don't know your name, where 
      you live, etc. We use this anonymous information to figure out what people 
      like about our site, how many visitors we get, and so forth. We share this 
      information with advertisers and others so they will know how valuable it 
      is to be associated with our site and we'll hopefully make some money and 
      nobody gets hurt.</li>
    <li>Contact information. It is always up to you, but you may GIVE us your 
      e-mail address, or other method of contacting you. When you do this, we 
      assume that you want us to communicate directly with you. So that's exactly 
      what we'll do unless and until you tell us to stop. Then we'll sulk but 
      immediately abide by your request.</li>
    <li>Personally identifiable information. This is personal information about 
      you, such as your name, address, phone number, et cetera. Again, we only 
      get this information if you VOLUNTARILY GIVE it to us, and when you do, 
      we assume that you want us to use it. If you later change your mind, we'll 
      stop using it immediately.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>Each time we provide you with an opportunity to "register" with us,
or provide us with contact information or other personally identifiable
information, there will ALWAYS be a "No Thanks" button so that you can tell
us to not communicate directly with you, and to not share your information
with anyone else.  And, if at any time you want us to stop using the
information, all you have to do is one of the following:</p>
<ul type="SQUARE">
  <ul type="SQUARE">
    <li>e-mail <a href="mailto:garfield@uclick.com">garfield@uclick.com</a></li>
    <li>Write<i> uclick </i>LLC., or Paws, Inc. at the addresses stated above.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>Now for the "long version:"</p>
<p><b>III. Information from Individuals Under the Age of 13</b></p>
<p>After years of research that turned out to be, well, frankly, worthless, we 
  do not collect any information from unborn children. We eventually learned that 
  the only thing these "people" wanted were things we couldn't sell, like water, 
  air, and a mother's love. They weren't much for typing, either.</p>
<p>We've also given up on kids that can't read, or type, or who could care less 
  about the internet, or worse, our sites.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, for individuals under the age of 13, we've discovered that they might 
  actually WANT to give us personally identifiable information, such as their 
  name, birth date, and email address. But we won't let them unless we have parental 
  consent. So, on pages controlled by us, if any personally identifiable information 
  is needed, we'll first ask if the user is under the age of 13. If you answer 
  "Yes," then we only collect personally identifiable information that we need 
  to allow you to participate, or to respond to a request by you -- typically, 
  this is limited to your name and email address. Registration for an individual 
  under the age of 13 can only be completed by a parent. </p>
<p>Once you have registered as an individual under the age of 13, your personally 
  identifiable information will be maintained in a separate database and it will 
  not be made available to any other company or entity. We will only use such 
  information to respond to specific requests, or to facilitate your participation 
  in a given activity on the site. We will also use email addresses to communicate 
  with the individuals about GARFIELD related matters, and to perhaps send an 
  electronic birthday card, unless you ask that such information not be sent to 
  you. Registration information can always be updated, revised, or deleted. The 
  choice is yours. All you have to do is contact us, or visit one of our sites 
  and update the registration.</p>
<b><u> 
<p>"Information Automatically Collected Online," and "Information Voluntarily 
  Provided to Site Affiliates," set forth below, also apply to individuals under 
  the age of 13. </p>
