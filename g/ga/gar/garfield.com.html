&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you are SO SPECIAL, we have assembled privacy experts from around the globe to devise the MOST PRIVATE PRIVACY STATEMENT ever created.  It is so private that NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IT IS!!  And we're going to keep it that way BY NOT TELLING YOU, EITHER!</p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just kidding.</p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the official GARFIELD® online site, and is jointly managed by Paws, Inc., an Indiana corporation owned by Jim Davis, the creator of "GARFIELD," and Universal New Media, a Missouri corporation owned by terrorists.  (O.k., the last part is a lie.  It's actually owned by very classy people that have made GARFIELD® the most widely syndicated comic strip in the world).  This site is dedicated to providing online entertainment to GARFIELD fans around the globe.  If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Statement, or this website, please feel free to contact:</p><p>

Producer, Garfield.com<br>
c/o Universal New Media<br>
4520 Main Street<br>
Suite 700<br>

<b>Summary</b></p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's the deal.  The internet has a lot of great advantages, and it enables people to interact in many different ways.  As a result of interaction, data and information can be obtained from you.  We only want to use that information in a ways that are known by you in advance, and in ways that are acceptable to you.</p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information that may be collected from you generally falls into three (3) categories.</p><p>
</p><li>Anonymous electronic footprints.  When our computers are "communicating" with another, that is, when you are surfing our pages, our computer identifies your computer and accumulates certain information, such as which pages you visited, and how long you were there.  But we don't know your name, where you live, etc.  We use this anonymous information to figure out what people like about our site, how many visitors we get, and so forth.  We share this information with advertisers and others so they will know how valuable it is to be associated with our site and we'll hopefully make some money and nobody gets hurt.<p>
</p></li><li>Contact information.  It is always up to you, but you may GIVE us your e-mail address, or other method of contacting you.  When you do this, we assume that you want us to communicate directly with you.  So that's exactly what we'll do unless and until you tell us to stop.  Then we'll sulk but immediately abide by your request.<p>
</p></li><li>Personally identifiable information.  This is personal information about you, such as your name, address, phone number, et cetera.  Again, we only get this information if you VOLUNTARILY GIVE it to us, and when you do, we assume that you want us to use it.  If you later change your mind, we'll stop using it immediately.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time we provide you with an opportunity to "register" with us, or provide us with contact information or other personally identifiable information, there will ALWAYS be a "No Thanks" button so that you can tell us to not communicate directly with you, and to not share your information with anyone else.  And, if at any time you want us to stop using the information, all you have to do is one of the following:</p><p>
</p></li><li>e-mail <a href="mailto:garfield@uexpress.com">garfield@uexpress.com</a><p>
</p></li><li>Write Universal New Media or Paws, Inc. at the addresses stated above.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for the "long version:"</p><p>

<b>We respect your privacy</b></p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We respect your privacy, and therefore we want to disclose to you how we may use information which you provide to us online, and give you some options to limit or restrict such use(s).  Since Internet technologies and the Internet environment are rapidly changing, these guidelines are subject to change, and any such changes will be posted on this page.</p><p>

<b>Information automatically collected online</b></p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our web server automatically recognizes the IP address (the location of your computer on the Internet) and the action of each visitor while on our site.  It also takes a picture of your bedroom.  (Just kidding on that last one).  Such information is used in the aggregate (and not specific to you or your specific usage) to improve our site, and may be shown to others (such as potential advertisers) to "profile" aggregate site usage.  Information automatically collected, and specific to your usage of the site, is only used for error tracking.</p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our web server deposits tasteless, odorless, no-fat cookies on the hard drive of your computer when it visits our site to make your visit a more enjoyable experience. We also use cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly.  The use of cookies is standard in the internet industry.  Your browser probably has a feature that will refuse our cookies (as would Garfield), or at least notify you before a cookie is placed, but utilizing this feature may interfere with your enjoyment of the Site.</p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do NOT use cookies to identify specific individuals, except when you specifically disclose such information to us.   We do NOT use cookies for promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third party.</p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may also occasionally get cookies from our advertisers or other participants on our Site.  These cookies are not controlled by us, and are subject to the privacy policies of the provider.</p><p>

<b>Information you provide to us</b></p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our site will give you various opportunities to interact with us.  For example, you may want to register in the GARFIELD® Fan Club.  Or participate in a contest.  Or buy something.  Or request information.  In any case, we may ask you to provide your name, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address, and other personally identifiable information.  We also request credit card information for stuff you want to buy. Credit card information is encrypted for security purposes, and is not shared with any other firm except as necessary to process your order.</p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will obviously use the information you give us for the specific purpose for which it was given.  We will also use it to improve our Site, and to improve the way that we do business.  Unless you request otherwise at the time you provide the information, we may also use your personally identifiable information to communicate with you about the GARFIELD Stuff® Catalog, and other GARFIELD-related information.</p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We occasionally make our customer list, consisting of names and mailing addresses, available to selected firms that want to offer products or services to you by mail.  In delivering this information, we may group you with other persons on our list that have bought similar amounts and/or types of products, but no information specific to you or your household will be disclosed.   If you do not want to receive such mailings, please notify us by contacting Producer Garfield.com at the mail or e-mail address stated above.  Phone numbers and e-mail addresses are never provided by us to third parties.</p><p> 

<b>Information you voluntarily provide to Site Affiliates</b></p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make our Site as entertaining as possible, and to deliver as many services to you as we can, we enter into agreements with third parties that will actually control a part or segment of our Site in connection with a service provided by them.  For example, G-TV, and G-Mail, are "Powered By" or controlled by independent companies.  We only do business with outfits that aren't outlaws, so we do our best to bring you only the best and most reputable providers in their respective fields.  Nonetheless, any data which you provide to them may be used in accordance with their policies and, if the data is shared with us, it may be used by Paws subject to these policies.</p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with any location on the internet, please be careful with whom you share information.</p><p>

<b>Information from children</b></p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not knowingly provide any identifiable information about a person under the age of 18 to any unrelated third party.   Typically, such information will only be used to fulfill a specific request.  We encourage parents to supervise the use of the internet by their children.  We also expect that any person under the age of 18 will not provide personally identifiable information to us without the consent of his or her parent or guardian.</p><p>

<b>Information we do not share with others</b></p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not sell or trade telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, or specific information about your household.  Except to verify credit card information and process orders, we do not use or disclose your credit card information for any purpose.  For privacy purposes, we store all customer information in a highly secure server that cannot be accessed through the Internet.</p></li></td>
