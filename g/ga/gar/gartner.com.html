 <li>When you provide information to us when registering to attend or while attending a Gartner event. At our events:
 <ul>
  <li>You may choose to use an RFID-enabled badge (which we use to track your location around our event sites so we can better understand your areas of interest) or a non-RFID enabled badge (which is not tracked); and</li>
  <li>Some exhibitor sessions and keynote presentations are recorded.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li>If you choose to link your Gartner account with your LinkedIn profile, we collect information from your profile.</li>
 <li>We use automated means (such as cookies) to collect data from your devices.</li>
 <li>If you choose to use our browser extension, Gartner Everywhere, we collect information from your browser.</li>
 <li>We share information within the Gartner corporate family in the ordinary course of business.</li>
 <li>We receive referrals from users and others.</li>
 <li>We collect or receive data from third parties, including, in some cases, publicly available directories, as part of our marketing and prospecting activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Types of Information</u></p>

<p>From the sources listed above, we collect the following types of information:</p>

<ul>
 <li>name, business email address, phone number, physical address</li>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Information Collected Automatically</u></p>

<p>When you use our websites or apps, we automatically collect and analyze certain information, which includes unique browser identifiers, IP addresses, browser and operating system information, device identifiers (such as the Apple IDFA or Android Advertising ID), geolocation and other device-specific information, Internet connection information, as well as details about your interactions with websites and apps.</p>

<p>When you access Gartner content via our apps, the apps will store an authentication token so you will not need to login every time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Use of Cookies and Other Technologies</u></p>

<p>We and third parties use various technologies to collect information about your activities on the Gartner websites and apps.</p>

<ul>
 <li><u>Cookies and other local storage technologies</u>. Cookies and local storage objects are files that contain data, such as unique identifiers, that we or a third party transfer to or read from your device to recognize the device, provide services, keep records, and conduct analytics and marketing. We and third parties use automated means to read or write information on your devices. These means include various types of cookies and other browser-based or plugin-based local storage (such as HTML5 storage or Flash-based storage).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:40px">You may choose to set your web browser to refuse certain types of cookies or to alert you when certain types of cookies are being sent.&nbsp; Some browsers offer similar settings for HTML5 local storage&nbsp;and Flash storage.&nbsp; However, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies or local storage, certain websites (including our own Websites) may not function properly.</p>

<ul>
 <li><u>Other technologies</u>. We use other standard automated technologies, such as web beacons (also called clear GIFs or pixel tags) or similar technologies to deliver or communicate with cookies and track your use of our websites and/or apps. We include web beacons in email messages to track whether you open the messages, as well as for other uses as described below.</li>
</ul>

<p>In some cases, we facilitate the collection of information by advertising services administered by third parties. The ad services track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means such as cookies, and they use this information to show you ads tailored to your individual interests or characteristics and/or based on prior visits to certain sites or apps, or other information we know, infer or have collected from you.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
 <li>For example, we and the third-party vendors use first- and third-party cookies together, as well as other automated means and other data (such as the data described above) to:
 <ul>
  <li>Recognize you and your devices;</li>
  <li>Inform, optimize, and serve ads; and</li>
  <li>Report on our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services (including how they are related to visits to specific sites or apps).&nbsp;</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<p>To learn more about interest-based advertising generally, including how to opt out from the targeting of interest-based ads by some of our current ad service partners, <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">click here</a>.&nbsp; For controls specific to advertising and analytics services offered by Google, click <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb#display_optout">here</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads">here</a> and <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>.&nbsp; If you replace, change or upgrade your browser, or delete your cookies, you may need to use these opt-out tools again.&nbsp; We do not respond to browser-based do-not-track signals.</p>

<p>Please refer to your mobile device manufacturer's website (or the website for its operating system) for instructions on how to use any additional privacy controls offered by your mobile operating system, such as privacy settings for device identifiers and geolocation.</p>

  <li>To create aggregated or anonymized data, which we may use and disclose without restriction;</li>
