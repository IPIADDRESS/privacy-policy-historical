<blockquote>

Cookies are used to track general usage patterns and to make the forums easier to use. For instance, after you have posted a message, your name and email address will be "remembered" in a cookie so the next time you post, you won't have to enter this information again. We could save this information in a central file on our server, but in the interest of privacy, we save it to a cookie, which resides on <i>your</i> computer. Cookies are also necessary for members to log in. Cookies are used both by ourselves and the various ad networks with which we are associated (see: Third Parties.)
<p>There are many misconceptions about cookies. Here are some facts:
</p><ul><p>
</p><li>The cookie is assigned by the Web site. It can only contain information known to that site.
</li><li>When a Web site reads a cookie, it can only read the information that the Web site itself had assigned to the cookie earlier.
</li><li>Only the site assigning a cookie can read it later.
</li><li>Drinking milk with your cookies will make them go down easier.
</li></ul>
