  </p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">GauherChaudhry</font><span class="bodytext"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">.com strives to offer
its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide
an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable
Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number)
subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter,
or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. Period."</font>
  </span>
  </p><p><span class="bodytext"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How we gather information from users</font>
  </span>
  </p><p><span class="bodytext"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How we collect and store information depends
on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate
and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information
when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request
certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You
may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests,
message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site.
Like most Web sites, </font></span><font face="Arial,Helvetica">GauherChaudhry</font><span class="bodytext"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">.com also collects information automatically
and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our
visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider
or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your
visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password,
sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit,
or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement
while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also
gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose
not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser
to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access
certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name
and password, and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features according
to your preferences.</font>
  </span>
  </p><p><span class="bodytext"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What we do with the information we collect</font>
  </span>
  </p><p><span class="bodytext"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Like other Web publishers, we collect information
to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising.
We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</font>
  </span>
  </p><p><span class="bodytext"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Aggregated Information (information that
does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example,
we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information
obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g.,
to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive).
Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers
and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally
Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</font>
  </span>
  </p><p><span class="bodytext"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We may use Personally Identifiable Information
collected on </font></span><font face="Arial,Helvetica">GauherChaudhry</font><span class="bodytext"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">.com to communicate with you about your
registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy
policy; services and products offered by GauherChaudhry.com and other
topics we think you might find of interest.&nbsp;</font>
  </span>
  </p><p><span class="bodytext"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Personally Identifiable Information collected
by GauherChaudhry.com may also be used for other purposes, including
but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of
e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and
other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical
support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example)
may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted
by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business,
we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses.
In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.
We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at
other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law,
in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or
to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary.
Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such
cases.</font>
