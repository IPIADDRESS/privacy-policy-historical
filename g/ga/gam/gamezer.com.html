are a winner. We may also use the information to communicate with you about new
features, products or services, or to improve the services that we offer by
tailoring them to your needs.

<br>

<br>Service Provider does not sell our users' e-mail addresses.

search software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to
provide those services. And if you choose to purchase items through features on
our site, we may forward your information to third parties for services such as
credit card processing and order fulfillment. There are also times when you
provide information about yourself to us in areas of the site that are managed
or participated in by third parties, such as our auction services or shopping

your needs or match your interests. While Service Provider will seek to require
such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not
authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which
it is provided, Service Provider does not bear any responsibility for any
actions or policies of third parties. There may also be occasion when we are
legally required to provide access to our database in order to cooperate with
police investigations or other legal proceedings. In those instances, the
