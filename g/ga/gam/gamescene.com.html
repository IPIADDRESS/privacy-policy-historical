<p class="headline">CleverMedia Privacy Statement for GameScene.com</p>

<p class="plain">CleverMedia, and its advertisers and affiliates are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. We do not collect information for any marketing purposes at all.</p>

<p class="plain">Memberships: Under our new system, you can sign up for a standard membership to GameScene, which gains you benefits, like a reserved high score name, subscription to our newsletter and notifications for beta tests. To do this, you must provide an email address. This is used to email a password to you, to send you newsletters and beta test notices. It is also used to verify that you have not signed up for a reserved name before -- we want there to be only one membership per person. We do not use this email address for any other purpose. We will not resell this email address or use it to send any advertisements. Optionally, you can provide your location from a list of counties and states. This is to allow us to show high score boards sorted by location. It is not used in conjunction with your email address for any other purpose.</p>

<p class="plain">Multiplayer Game Names: Users are asked for an alias when they enter a multiplayer game area. This alias is used to identify the players in the game. No other information is collected. These aliases are not used for any other purpose.</p>

<p class="plain">Recommend to a Friend: When you use the "Recommend this game to a friend" feature on one of our sites, your email address is required so that it can be attached to the email, just like it would be if you were sending an email using client software. We do not use this email address for any other purpose.</p>

<p class="plain">Advertisements: CleverMedia uses a variety of Web advertising companies. These companies place banner ads and pop-up windows on our site automatically. They each have a privacy policy. You can find the individual ad company policies in links organized by site further down in this document.</p>

Notice that I have replaced the @ symbol with (at) and the . with (dot) so that the email can't be harvested by spammers from this page. If anyone uses this special email address to send us SPAM, we will take appropriate action according to federal and state laws.</p>
