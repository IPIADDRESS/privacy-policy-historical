                <p>
                Gametop Pte. Ltd. is committed to protecting your privacy online. To further this commitment,
                we have adopted an Online Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, store,

                </p>
                <h2>What information does Gametop Pte. Ltd. collect?</h2>
                <p>Gametop Pte. Ltd. may request and/or collect information from you on a voluntary
                basis when you: register with us; participate in contests, events or promotions;

                The requested information may include personal information such as your name
                and e-mail address.</p>
                <p>If you are under the age of 13, you will need your parent or guardian's consent
                before you can provide any personal information to us for purposes of registration
                and other online activities.</p>
                <h2>Promotions</h2>
                <p>
                To participate in some of our promotions, you may be asked to provide an e-mail
                address and/or name, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. Please
                do not use your real name for these promotions;</p>
                <h2>E-mail</h2>
                <p>By allowing you to send e-mail to us, we are not attempting to collect any
                personal information about you. We will only use personal information (such
                as name and e-mail address) contained in your e-mail to respond to your specific
                inquiry or comments in the e-mail. Although we may retain your e-mail for
                a period of time, we will not use any personal information contained in your
                e-mail for any purpose other than responding to your specific inquiry or comments.
                Whatever the activity may be, we will only collect information to the extent

                objectives.</p>
                <h2>Cookies</h2>
                <p>
                Gametop Pte. Ltd. may use cookies to improve the use of our websites. A cookie
                is a small file that websites often store on a user's
                computer. Storage of cookies on your system provides an easy and convenient
                method for us to personalize your experience on our websites. For example, cookies
                allow us to remember your screen name, tell us that you have visited our website
                before, and may contain information that will make your next visit to our website
                more enjoyable. However, we do not use cookies to store personal information
                such as your name. In addition, Gametop Pte.Ltd. does not use cookies to retrieve
                information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. You

                <p>Gametop Pte. Ltd. may also collect your IP address for safety and security purposes.
                An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify
                your computer every time you log on to the Internet.</p>
                <h2>Log Files</h2>

                example, log file entries are generated every time a visitor clicks the "Online
                Shop" icon on our site. These entries enable Gametop Pte. Ltd. to assess
                overall site activity, track interest in advertised sales, track interest in
                purchase behavior, and troubleshoot technical concerns.
                Through the use of log files, we may also collect certain demographic information
                such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer),
                the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows 98 or Mac OS), and
                the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).</p>

                users to read third party sites' privacy policies before submitting personal
                information. Gametop Pte. Ltd. is not responsible for the privacy practices of
                the content of third party sites'. Gametop Pte. Ltd. hereby disclaims any representations
                or warranties expressed on any site other than its own site.</p>
