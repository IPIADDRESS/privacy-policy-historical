</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
	          3.1 The information we collect will only be used in connection with our provision of Services to you and to comply with legal obligations.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
	          We also may share with our service providers and partners personal information, necessary for provision of their services (see point 4.1.2). We use information held about you to assist you as our customer, to provide you with the information you have requested, to improve our Services to prevent fraud, and note your preferences to provide the best user experience possible, and particularly for the following legitimate business purposes:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
	<strong>To provide and operate our Service</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="background-color: initial;">To create user accounts / profiles to enable you to play our games and use our Services, where necessary;</span></li>
	<li>To provide, deliver and operate Services you request;</li>
	<li>To enable you to communicate with other users;</li>
	<li>To send you Service-related communications (for example changes, updates, new features);</li>
	<li>To verify and confirm payments (we do not collect or retain credit card information);</li>
	<li>To provide you with the correct versions of our games (for example, language of the game). </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
	<strong>To keep the Service safe and fair </strong>
</p>
<p>
	          In order to keep the Service and its social features safe and fair, to fight fraud and ensure acceptable use otherwise:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="background-color: initial;">To monitor use of the Service and its social features;</span></li>
	<li>To moderate chats either automatically or manually;</li>
	<li>To prevent and/or detect illegal activities, fraud or fraudulent behavior;</li>
	<li>To take action against fraudulent or misbehaving players as well as illegal activities (such as hacking or cheating). </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
	<strong>To keep eSports tournaments cheat-free and fair </strong>
</p>
<p>
	          From time to time, Game Insight together with its eSports tournament partners may organize eSports tournaments of our games (such as ESL Guns of Boom Season 2). Cheat-free and fair eSports tournaments are of utmost importance to Game Insight and its eSports tournament partners. We are putting forth maximum efforts to make sure that eSports tournament rules are followed and enforced to the fullest extent, all contenders have an equal opportunity to compete and the winners are determined by skill rather than cheating.
</p>
<p>
	         Therefore, only for the duration of your eSports tournament match, Game Insight may record data relating to your gameplay (for example, capture screenshots). Players who refuse such recording will not be able to join the matches and may be disqualified. Game Insight may use such recorded data for the purposes of cheat investigation and sanctioning. We will send you an in-game reminder before the start of the tournament match.
</p>
<p>
	            We kindly ask players to disable device notifications for the whole duration of the tournament match, so they won’t be unintentionally captured.

<p>
	<strong>7. COOKIES </strong>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
	      7.1 We use cookies and similar technologies such as local storage within our apps to provide and optimise our Service. You can control which cookies you get and which you keep on your device through your browser settings. Unless you have adjusted your browser settings so that it will refuse our cookies, our system will issue cookies when you visit our website.

</p>
<p>
	<strong>8. LINKS </strong>
</p>
<p>
	    Our Service may contain links to and from other websites and Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any third party sites. Please check the individual Privacy Notice of any such websites or Services before you submit any personal information to them.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>9. ADVERTISERS </strong>
</p>
<p>
	    Please note that we show third party advertising in our games and also advertise our Services via third parties. We wanted to provide you with more detail about how we use information for advertising, both in-game and on other third party properties.
</p>
<p>
	<u><strong>When you view ads on Game Insight’s properties </strong></u>
</p>
<p>
	    To enable us to show in-game ads we may send your advertising ID, IP-address and other information to advertisers (or ad networks) to enable them to find appropriate ads to serve to you in our games and on third party properties. You can control and limit our use of your advertising ID in your device settings. Game Insight does not control which specific ads are shown in our games (this is controlled by ad networks) but we do blacklist certain categories of ads.
</p>
<p>
	   Advertising IDs are used by the ad networks for a number of purposes, for example, to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="background-color: initial;">limit the number of times you see the same ad;</span></li>
	<li>ensure they are dealing with humans/with real devices and not automated bots;</li>
	<li>to serve you with advertisements likely to be relevant to you; </li>
	<li>other brands buy advertisement placement via an ad network or ad exchange to advertise their products in Game Insight’s games. The ad network or ad exchange acts as intermediary between the other game companies and Game Insight. In order for an ad network to charge the company buying the ad, clicks from the ad and potentially installs of other developers’ applications party apps are tracked. Views, clicks, installs and similar events from ads are measured using Advertiser ID. </li>
</ul>
<p>
	   IP-address is typically used by advertisers to broadly see the general geographic area you are coming from for example country, state, and sometimes at city level.
</p>
<p>
	 <u><strong>When you view Game Insight’s ads on third party services </strong></u>
</p>
<p>
	   Game Insight also advertises its games in other apps by asking ad networks to serve its ads to audiences that will be interested in them. The advertising IDs are used by the ad networks for a number of purposes, including, for example, to measure ad effectiveness (looking at aggregated views, clicks and installs it generates through its advertising in other publishers’ games). Advertising IDs are also used to track views, clicks, installs and other similar events from ads.
</p>
<p>
	   You can opt out of interest based advertising on mobile applications by changing the privacy settings of your device and selecting "limit ad tracking" (Apple iOS) or "opt out of interest based ads" (Android).
</p>
<p>
	 <strong>10. KEEPING YOUR ACCOUNT SECURE </strong>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
	   10.1 Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the Service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and you are responsible for any misuse of such information. You must change your password on a regular basis and must not share your password with anyone.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
	   10.2 You are solely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your account. Please ensure that you do not allow anyone else to access the Service in your name and sign off after you have finished accessing your account.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
	   10.3 You are responsible for all orders, and for the accuracy of all information, sent via the internet using your user ID, password or any other personal identification used to identify you on the Services.
</p>

</p>
<p>
	   (c) to opt-out of personalized offers based on your in-game activities and behavior and to object to use your personal information for direct marketing purposes;
</p>
<p>
	   (d) if we are processing your personal information with your consent, you can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> at any time.

</p>
<p>
	     (e) you have <strong>the right to complain</strong> to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.

	   We will respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
