    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY </h1>
    <h3>EB Games’ Commitment to Privacy</h3>
    <p> At EB Games we are committed to your right to privacy.  We collect personal information from our customers in the regular course of doing business.  We have developed this Privacy Policy to explain our practices for the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.</p>
    <p>This Policy applies only to our websites.  It does not apply to our retail stores or to any other channels owned or operated by EB Games that are used for the sale of products or services.  EB Games maintains a separate privacy policy for personal information collected with respect to its retail store operations. All references to “websites” in this Privacy Policy mean <a href="http://www.ebgames.ca" target="_blank">www.ebgames.ca</a>, <a href="http://www.gamestop.ca" target="_blank">www.gamestop.ca</a>, or other EB Games-provided websites.</p>
    <h3>How Do We Obtain Your Consent to the Collection of Your Personal Information?</h3>
    <p>When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, place a pre-order, or return a purchase, we assume you consent to our collecting your personal information and using it for that specific reason. </p>
    <p>If we ask you for personal information for a secondary reason, like contests, we will either ask you directly for your consent or provide you with an opportunity to say no.  If you accept an offer made by any of our third party marketing partners, we will disclose your relevant personal information, including name, address, credit/debit card number and other billing information to that third party, in accordance with the terms of the offer.</p>
    <p>Express and Implied Consent – We may ask you to give your express consent, such as by checking a box to indicate your consent to receive marketing communications, or by providing your signature to indicate your acceptance of the use and disclosure terms presented on an application form.  Other times, we may obtain your consent implicitly when we can reasonably conclude that you’ve given consent by some action you have taken or an action you have decided not to take. Generally, this occurs where the purpose for use of your personal information would be reasonably apparent to you.</p>
    <p>How to Change or Withdraw Your Consent - You may notify us at any time that you wish to withdraw or change your consent to our use and disclosure of your information. We will accommodate your request following receipt of such notice, subject to legal and contractual restrictions related to your transactions.</p>
    <p>If you have "opted in" or subscribed to one of our newsletters or mailing lists, we will always provide you the opportunity to "opt out" or unsubscribe. For example, each e-newsletter we send to you will include a link or other method to unsubscribe or decline further e-newsletters.</p>
    <p>When you choose to provide us with your personal information you consent to the use and disclosure of your personal information as identified in this Privacy Policy and as may be further identified at the time of collection.</p>
    <h3>What Information Do We Collect About You?</h3>
    <p>At EB Games, we collect personal information and non-personal information. The types of information we collect depend on the nature of your interaction with us. You may choose not to provide us with your personal information. However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or information that you requested.</p>
    <p>Personal information - Personal information is information that can identify an individual or information about an identifiable individual. We may collect personal information including the following:</p>

        <li>financial information and transaction information – products purchased, method of payment, amount paid, and credit or debit card number.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Non-personal information - Non-personal information does not identify you as an individual. For example, we may collect certain non-personal data when you visit our websites, such as your Internet Protocol address, the type and version of browser you are using or the referring URL; or we may collect and summarize customer information in a non-personal, aggregate format for statistical and research purposes.</p>
    <h3>How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</h3>

    </ul>
    <h3>Information EB Games Collects Directly from You</h3>
    <p>Returns and Exchanges – In connection with any returns, refunds or exchanges, we ask for personal information such as your name, address, and telephone number for the purposes of detecting and preventing fraud.</p>
    <p>Purchase Follow-Up and Surveys - Following a purchase, we may send you a follow-up letter either thanking you for your business or inquiring as to whether you are satisfied with your new product.  We may use contact information collected from you to conduct occasional surveys and other customer research. These surveys are entirely voluntary.</p>
    <p>Our Websites – You can browse our websites anonymously.  However, to order products and services from our websites, or to use special features or functions of our websites, you may be asked to provide personal information, such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, or credit or debit card information. We use this information to create your account, contact and correspond with you about your order, respond to your inquiries, and monitor functions or features of our websites that you may use.</p>
    <p>Customer Reviews and Posted Content – We may provide you with the ability to rate or review products or services we sell, or otherwise post content on our websites.  Any comments or reviews that you provide are accessible to all visitors to our website, so you should use discretion when posting information and you should not post personal information.  EB Games has no responsibility if you do post personal information.  Subject to the other provisions of this privacy policy relating to your personal information, you grant a perpetual worldwide non-exclusive license to EB Games to copy, use and/or display any content that you post on any of our websites.</p>
    <p>Newsletters or Updates - EB Games also may offer you the opportunity to sign up for newsletters or other promotional communications.  If you decide to do so, we will collect your contact information, such as name and email address. This information will only be used to send you the newsletter and promotional announcements that you have requested. You may “unsubscribe” at any time by using the unsubscribe link included in the footer of the newsletter or by using the unsubscribe link included below under the heading “Unsubscribe”.  We do not rent our subscriber list or offer to sell it to other parties.</p>
    <p>Contest and Other Promotions - From time to time, we may run contests or promotions. If you participate, you may be asked for contact information as well as additional optional survey information (for example, product preferences).  Personal information from contest entries will be used only to administer the contest and contact you if you win. For research and analysis purposes, we may also aggregate contest survey information in a manner that no longer identifies individual participants. All contests and promotions are subject to this Privacy Policy and the rules provided for each particular contest or promotion.  If a contest is by a third party, it will be subject to the third party’s contest rules and policies.</p>
    <p>Subscription Services and Activations - EB Games may offer activation of certain products and services like online games, downloadable games or game components, or Internet services. These activations may require that certain contact and financial information be collected and provided to EB Games or to the respective service providers as part of the activation process.</p>
    <p>Call Centres - EB Games operates customer support call centres to respond to your questions, concerns, or complaints regarding our products or services. When you contact our call centres, we may ask for personal information to help us respond to your inquiry or to verify your identity.  For example, if you have a question about the status of a recent online order, we will ask for personal information to verify that you are the account holder. We may also monitor or record your telephone discussions with our customer support representatives for training purposes and to ensure service quality.</p>
    <h3>Information EB Games Collects Automatically</h3>
    <p>Our Websites - When you use our websites, we may collect the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer and of your Internet service provider, the date and time you access our websites, the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our website, the computer operating system you are using, the sections of our website you visit, the website pages read and images viewed, and the content you download from the website. This information is used for website and system administration purposes and to improve the websites.</p>
    <p>Cookies – EB Games may use cookies to store your individual preferences and system information.  “Cookies” are small electronic data files that websites can store on your computer for record keeping purposes.  For example, cookies will remember what you've placed in your shopping cart, and tell us that you have visited one of our websites before. Cookies also may be used on the website for other reasons, such as to limit the number of times you have to enter a password or enter your language preference, to offer personalized web page content and information for your use, and to track your activity at the website.  The use of cookies is standard in the Internet industry and many websites use them.  In addition, you may modify your browser’s settings to notify you whenever a website is going to deposit a cookie on your computer’s hard drive or other storage media.  The notification option generally gives you the opportunity to decide whether to accept or refuse a cookie in each instance. You can configure your browser to always disable cookies when cookies are being sent to your computer, although this may affect your ability to shop online, both at EB Games and elsewhere.</p>
    <p>Website Tracking Information – Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. We may use web beacons (sometimes called “clear gifs”, “web bugs” or “pixel tags”) to compile tracking information reports regarding website user demographics, website traffic patterns, and website purchases. We may then provide these reports to advertisers and others. None of the tracking information in these reports can be connected to the identities or other personal information of individual users. In addition, we may use web beacons in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you do not want to receive these emails, please see the “unsubscribe” section below.  For EB Games’ own research purposes we may link tracking information with personal information voluntarily provided by website users. Once such a link is made, all of the linked information is treated as personal information and will be used and disclosed only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Links to Other Websites - Our website may contain links that permit you to link to other websites or Internet resources. When you click on one of those links you are connecting to another website or Internet resource. EB Games has no responsibility or liability for, or control over, those other websites or Internet resources or their collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those other websites before you submit any personal information to them.</p>
    <p>Data on Returned Product – if you return products that may contain stored or recorded personal information, like computers, game consoles, etc., you are responsible for deleting or removing all personal information and media from your product before you return it. EB Games is not responsible for any personal data or media that you do not delete or remove from such product.</p>
    <p>We May Supplement Information - From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information you have provided to us. This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide better service.</p>
    <h3>Does EB Games Share Your Information?</h3>
    <p>EB Games does not sell or rent our customers’ personal information to any other party. However, in the normal course of business we may share some of your personal information within our corporate family and with third parties (such as agents, mandataries or service providers) acting on our behalf, or as permitted or required by law.</p>
    <p>In addition, if you accept an offer from any of our third party marketing partners, we will share your contact and billing information with that specific third party, in accordance with the terms of the offer.  If you have previously requested that your personal information not be shared with third parties, but then later consent by accepting a third party marketing offer available through one of our websites, we will share your contact and billing information with that specific third party, in accordance with the terms of the offer.</p>
    <p>Some of these operations may result in personal information collected by EB Games being stored or processed outside of Canada and, as a result, your personal information may be accessible to law enforcement and regulatory authorities in accordance with the law of these foreign jurisdictions.</p>
    <p>Service Providers - EB Games may use third parties to manage one of more aspects of our business operations, including the processing or handling of personal information.  We may share personal information with such third parties to perform services on our behalf such as fulfilling online orders, processing non-cash payments, sending marketing communications, servicing products, conducting research surveys, verifying and validating information that you have provided to us, delivering products, and providing customer support services.  When we do use an outside company, we use contractual and other appropriate means to ensure that your personal information is used in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>EB Games has taken precautions to prevent the fraudulent use of your information on our websites. EB Games has adopted industry standard authentication procedures to ensure your protection while shopping with us online. This includes, but is not limited to, contacting financial institutions or credit reporting agencies to ensure the authenticity of your credit card and to validate your credit card billing information.</p>
    <p>Information Shared Amongst EB Games, its Corporate Parents, Affiliates, Subsidiaries and Divisions - EB Games may share personal information gathered on our websites with EB Games retail stores (and vice versa) and amongst our corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or divisions for internal business purposes in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  If EB Games shares your information within its corporate family, we will ensure that your information continues to be used only in accordance with this Privacy Policy and your expressed choices.</p>
    <p>Product Safety Recalls - In the event we receive notice from a manufacturer or supplier of a product safety recall, we may provide your contact information, limited to name, address and telephone number, to the manufacturer so that they may notify you of the recall and supply details of any replacement or repair programs. This transfer of your contact information will occur only for recalls that may impact your personal safety or impair the functionality of the product you purchased from us.</p>
    <p>Sale or Transfer of Business or Assets of EB Games - Any information we have about you may be transferred or disclosed to a purchaser or prospective purchaser in the event of a sale, assignment, or other transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the transferee uses your information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Legal Disclosure - EB Games may disclose your information as permitted or required by law. For example, we may be compelled to release information by a court of law or other person or entity with jurisdiction to compel production of such information. If we have reasonable grounds to believe information could be useful in the investigation of improper or unlawful activity, we may disclose information to law enforcement agencies or other appropriate investigative bodies.</p>
    <h3>How does EB Games Protect Your Information?</h3>
    <p>The file containing your personal information will be stored on our servers and will only be accessible to our employees and those of our agents, mandataries and service providers who require it in the course of their duties. EB Games takes appropriate steps to protect your personal information.  We maintain appropriate safeguards and current security standards to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse. For example, electronic records are stored in secure, limited-access servers; electronic data is stored behind secured encryption access; we use technological tools like firewalls and passwords; and we ensure our employees are trained on the importance of maintaining the security and confidentiality of personal information.</p>
    <p>SSL Technology - Our websites use encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”), to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL encrypts ordering information such as your name, address, and credit card number.</p>
    <p>VeriSign Certification - Our websites have received a VeriSign certificate to confirm that we have met with industry standard security protocols. For your online security, always verify you are on an authentic EB Games website by clicking on the VeriSign logo located in the lower right footer of our homepage. Make sure that the URL of the VeriSign confirmation page begins with "<a href="https://seal.verisign.com/">https://seal.verisign.com</a>".</p>
    <p>Choosing a Password - When you create an online account on our websites, you will be prompted to select a personal password. To maximize your level of protection, you should choose a strong personal password, which means that you should use at least 6 characters including a combination of both letters and numbers. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and any account information. EB Games will never send an unsolicited communication asking you for your password or requesting that you update your account credentials.</p>
    <p>Although we cannot take responsibility for any theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction of data by a third party, we take reasonable precautions to prevent such occurrences.</p>
    <h3>How Can You Verify Your Information?</h3>
    <p>You may check your information to verify, update, or correct it, and to have any obsolete information removed. If you created an account on one of our websites, you can access and change your online account profile yourself. You can also ask to review any of the information that we have retained, how we have used it, and to whom we have disclosed it at any time by contacting us as indicated below under the heading “Contacting EB Games”. Subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law, and provided we can authenticate your identity, you will be given reasonable access to your personal information, and will be entitled to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and to have it amended as appropriate. You may also ask us to change your preferences regarding how we use or disclose your information, or let us know that you do not wish to receive any further communication from us.</p>
    <h3>When is Your Information Removed?</h3>
    <p>We keep your information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and to meet any legal requirements. We have retention standards that meet these parameters.
