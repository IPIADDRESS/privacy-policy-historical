However, as described in more detail in Part C below, there are limited circumstances in which some of your information will be shared with third parties, under strict restrictions, so it is important for you to review this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This Privacy Policy contains numerous general and technical details about the steps we take to respect your privacy concerns. We have organized this Privacy Policy by major processes and areas so that you can quickly link to the information of most interest to you. The bottom line is that meeting your needs and expectations form the foundation of everything we do – including protecting your privacy.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;"><b>Changes in Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A-Digi wants you to be always aware of what personal information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it. All personal information, as further described in Part B, that we collect and maintain will be subject to the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of such collection. A-Digi reserves the right to change the Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion, and will prominently post any material changes on the home page of the Website. You will be given the opportunity to opt-out. If as the result of such changes, you want to alter the ways in which A-Digi is allowed to use your personal information, you can do so by following the procedure described in Section Creating and Updating Your Personal Account and Preferences. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, and will be subject to, the changes to the Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Website after such notice has been posted for thirty (30) days with the following exception: if at the time you provide personal information to A-Digi you limit how such information will be used to communicate with you, either by A-Digi or by third parties, A-Digi will not change your preference in this regard without your express consent.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>Third Party Websites</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A-Digi does not control the information collection and distribution policies on Internet domains other than those Internet domains that are under the control of A-Digi itself. When you are on the A-Digi Website, you may be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. These other sites may independently collect data, solicit personal information, or send their own cookies to you. A-Digi is not responsible for any use of the information including click-stream data created when using such third party sites.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>Legal Issues</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A-Digi will disclose personally identifiable information without your permission when required by law, or in good faith belief that such action is necessary to investigate or protect against harmful activities to A-Digi guests, visitors, associates, or property (including this Website), or to others. As mentioned above, laws related to personal identifiable information vary by country. Personally identifiable information collected in the European Union is subject to the EU Directives concerning personal data, privacy and electronic communications, including but not limited to Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector and Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A-Digi may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information to appropriate governmental authorities.

A-Digi may also provide information to law enforcement to protect its property and the health and safety of individuals as permitted by statute.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">B. COLLECTED INFORMATION</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>Browsing</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This Website does not collect personally identifiable information from your computer when you browse the Website and request pages from our servers. This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with personally identifiable information, we will not know your name, your e-mail address, or any other personally identifiable information. When you request a page from our Website, our servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header, JavaScript or similar technical tools, including the IP number, the time of the request, the URL of your request and other information. We collect such information in order to make our Website function correctly and provide you the functionality that you see on this Website, as our servers use this information to deliver to you the pages on this Website. We also use this information to better understand how visitors use our Website and how we can better tune our Website, its contents and functionality to meet your needs.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>Information We Collect</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As a visitor to this Website, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal information as described above in Section Browsing above. In connection with other activities, such as subscribing to the services offered on the Website, subscribing to periodic newsletters sent by A-Digi, requesting customer support, downloading browser extensions, utilizing online software applications and services available on the Website, A-Digi may ask you to voluntarily supply us with certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities or make purchases, however, A-Digi may ask that you provide us personal information, defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including but not limited to your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), e-mail address, employer, and other personal information. This information is requested in conjunction with the registration of our Products or Services. In addition, as noted below, minimum information is requested if you choose to subscribe to our newsletter service.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">You never have to answer any questions, and you can decline this exchange of information at any time. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A-Digi is the sole owner of the information it gathers on the Website. A-Digi will only share your information with outside parties in ways that are described in this privacy statement or if we are required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, cooperate with law enforcement agencies, or comply with a legal process served on our Website.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">When you use the Website, A-Digi or third parties authorized by A-Digi may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Website and its services. When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to A-Digi every time you access content on one of our internet domains within the Website. Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the “Refer”), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version you are using to access our site. All of this information may be collected by A-Digi and used to help improve our offerings to you.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">We use such data to facilitate and track your use of the Website and its services. A-Digi also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Website. Without expressly informing you in each particular circumstance, we do not match such information with any of your personal information.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">When you place an order for software or services online, you may be re-directed to a third-party Website. Any third-party company administers its own Privacy Policy that is not under the control of A-Digi. Prior to placing an online order, please review the Privacy Policy on that Website.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">You are provided an opportunity on the A-Digi Website to subscribe to a periodic newsletter. This newsletter is a marketing tool that allows A-Digi to inform you of new Products and Services, as well as other news relevant to the company. The subscription service requires you to provide your first and last name as well as your email address. Optionally, you are asked to provide the name of the company you represent. You are given the opportunity to choose the type of information we provide to you.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b><i>While the subscription list is maintained by a trusted third party affiliate, the list remains the sole exclusive property of A-Digi. Your name and email address is not shared with any third party and will not be used to send you unsolicited communications. A link is provided to allow you to change your subscription preferences, including cancellation of your subscription.</i></b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">When you submit personal information to A-Digi through this Website, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which A-Digi and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of A-Digi. Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A-Digi may establish relationships with various service providers whose services may become available to you from this Website or from other websites that are linked to this Website. Typically, these providers would offer services that A-Digi customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with A-Digi services and products. In order to use those services, you may be required to provide personal information to the providers. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide while you are visiting a provider’s Website will be subject to the privacy policy posted on such site, and personal information that you provide while on this Website in conjunction with a provider’s service will be subject to this Privacy Policy. You should be aware that our agreements with these service providers often provide that they will share with A-Digi personal information collected from you. In such instances, A-Digi may use this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>Information for Affiliates and Software Developers</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">From time to time, companies or individuals who develop software may access this Website in an effort to enter into a business relationship with A-Digi. In addition, owners of third-party websites may access this Website in an effort to affiliate with A-Digi. Contact information for this purpose is posted on our Website. For these individuals and entities, in addition to information related to your business, A-Digi reserves the right to request personal information including but not limited to your full name, physical address, email address, telephone contact number, employer, etc. This information will normally be requested only in those situations where you are not contacting A-Digi in the capacity of an agent or representative of an established business, and only in those circumstances where the information is required in order to consummate a business relationship. You may elect not to provide personal identifying information. However, failure to provide the requested information may hinder A-Digi’s ability to do business with you.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>Accessing and Updating Your Personal Preferences</b></p>

While playing an arcade game, the player must make decisions quickly and react instantly. In general, arcade games are characterized by an extensive bonus system.  Bonuses can be charged during gameplay and after completing a level.

The term &quot;arcade&quot; appeared after casinos installed the first slot machines. The games were simple so large numbers of people could master them. Thereafter, arcade games began to appear on consoles.

Arcade games can offer a variety of experiences. For example, there are shooters, racing games, and classical titles. Popular arcade games include &quot;Pac Man,&quot; &quot;Mario,&quot; and &quot;Icy Tower.&quot;

Arcade games are becoming popular again. They're simple to learn and play, and they don't demand a large investment of time. One can play an arcade game in five minutes, and then play another, and another if they choose, which serves only to boost their popularity.
">Arcade Games</a>

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-3"><a href="http://gamextazy.com/category/arkanoid/" title="Arkanoid games are exceeded in popularity only by Tetris. This style of game first appeared in the mid '80s and immediately became very popular. The essence of the game is to break walls built of small blocks. To do this, the player must hit the bricks with a ball bounced off of a small paddle, which the player controls. When the player has destroyed all of the blocks, the next level loads. Typically, each successive level has a tougher wall to break or the speed of the game increases.

Players of all ages enjoy Arkanoid because of the variety of games available, including simple games for children and more intense games for avid fans.

Arkanoid is well suited to fans of fast-paced action. While playing, there's no time to relax or stop thinking because the ball could quickly slip past the paddle and be out of play.

When Arkanoid first appeared on the scene, no one thought it would still be wildly popular today, when games have become more captivating and realistic. But it continues to attract players with its simplicity, both in terms of the gameplay and the lack of a complex storyline. People simply launch the ball and begin to play. Also, Arkanoid titles are similar to each other, differing only in terms of the bonuses provided and the setting in which the game takes place, so there's a familiarity with which people feel comfortable. And people like that they can play an Arkanoid almost indefinitely. After all, coming up with a hundred or even a thousand levels is easy, as a game can be programmed to create a level more complicated and intense than the previous one. Finally, people love to boast about their accomplishments.

Players have probably spent too much time playing Arkanoids. If you took all of the time people have spent playing Arkanoid and invested it in the aerospace industry, people would be playing Arkanoid in space. But each person is able to choose what he or she does - whether it's working or relaxing while playing Arkanoid. While playing Arkanoid might not value society in a tangible way, it's important for people to enjoy themselves. After all, man cannot simply work, eat, and sleep, but must enjoy life as well. That enjoyment can include not only going to a play or visiting a museum, but also playing a wonderful game of Arkanoid.

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-4"><a href="http://gamextazy.com/category/hidden-object/" title="The beautiful outdoors, mysterious tombs, dark rooms, old cellars, mine shafts, lonely streets, and a greenhouse filled with stunning blossoms. What do these things have in common? When ruined, they can turn into an awful mess. But what can you do about it?

As luck would have it, you meet a stranger. He begins to explain why your surroundings resemble your worst nightmares. Of course, this will not do, and your conscience compels you to explore the area and find a way to make things right.

Hidden object games are designed to grab your interest and challenge your brain. Maybe you think hunting for hidden items and solving puzzles sounds boring, like chess. The developers of the first hidden object games avoided this pitfall by combining the mental challenges of chess with captivating searches for cleverly concealed items. To make the games even more immersive, they added the element of storytelling. Some games have a plot comparable to a full-length movie, while the characters are reminiscent of Hollywood stars.

Hidden object games exercise your mind, so the more you play them, the easier it is to remember important things. For example, trying to memorize passages in a book, formulas, and dates in history can cause students a terrible headache, all because they haven't developed a good memory. However, logic games strengthen the mind, giving young people firm ground on which to stand when telling their parents they need to take time out from their studies to play.

Also, over time, every person's memory weakens, to the point where it's difficult to remember people's names. Scientists, however, have proven that logic games fortify the mind. The research is so conclusive, games are even used in classes in the U.S.

All arguments in favor of playing logic games aside, one fact remains: If you want to plunge into a world of adventure and save a princess, kill a dragon, capture a villain, drive a mummy back to his tomb, or search for dinosaur footprints - you need to play a hidden object game.

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-5"><a href="http://gamextazy.com/category/match-3/" title="In a match 3 game, the player makes combinations of three or more matching items on a game board. At the beginning of a level, the game board (which is often laid out like a grid) is filled with randomly placed items of different colors, and the player must swap the items in order to line up three or more matching items. When a match is created, the items are removed from the board, and new items fall down from the top of the board to replace them. The goal of most match 3 games is to score as many points as possible within a limited amount of time.

The match 3 genre has been popular for several years, and its popularity has only grown since its introduction on mobile devices. The ease of the gameplay and the simplicity of the mechanics make it a good fit for touch screen devices.

Several free match 3 games are available for online play or download on Gamextazy.

Shooters are a staple in the game industry. Before there were strategy games, before there were role playing games, before there were puzzle games, there were shooters. But the shooter has long since evolved from its simple roots. Whereas shooters once consisted of pointing two-dimensional ships at enemies or asteroids and furiously pressing the fire button, 21st century shooters are works of art complete with intricate storylines, complex characters, and a bevy of features. The most important part of any shooter, however, is that the player do a lot of SHOOTING. Everything else is secondary. Gamextazy will always help you to choose and download the best PC shooters.
