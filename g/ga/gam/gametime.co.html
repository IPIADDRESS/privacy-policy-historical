      <p>
        We collect the following
        types of information about you:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          Information you provide
          us directly:
        </b>
        We ask for certain information such as your username, first and last name, phone number and e-mail address
        when you register for a Gametime United account, or if you correspond with us.  We may also retain any
        messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post
        to the Service.  We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.
      </p>
      <p><b>
          Information we may
          receive from third parties
        </b>: We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or
        Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,”
        adding the Gametime United application, linking your account to the Gametime United Service, etc., that third party
        may pass certain information about your use of its service to Gametime United.  This information could include,
        but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token
        necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and
        any information you have made public in connection with that service.  If you allow us access to your friends list,
        your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, these may be used and stored to make your experience
        more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and
        when your friends join Gametime United. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on
        third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Gametime United Service.  You may also unlink
        your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.  If you unlink your
        third party account, we will remove the information collected about you in connection with that service.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b></b>
        If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service through our “Invite friends” feature,
        you may directly choose a friend to invite through your mobile device’s native contact list.  If you allow us access to
        your mobile device’s native contact list, it may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you
        to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join Gametime United.
        You should always review, and if necessary, change your privacy settings on the Service, by changing your profile settings.
        You understand that by inviting a friend to Gametime United through the “Invite friends” feature, you are directly sending a text
        or email from your personal accounts. In addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications
        sent from your phone. Since this invitation is coming directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this
        communication.
      </p>
      <p><b>
          Finding your friends on
          the Service:
        </b>If
        you choose, you can locate your friends with Gametime United accounts through
        our “Find friends” feature. The “Find friends” feature allows you to choose to
        locate friends either through (i) your contact list, (ii) social media sites
        (such as Twitter or Facebook) or (iii) through a search of names and usernames
        on Gametime United. If you choose to find your friends through your contact
        list, then you agree to provide Gametime United access to your contact list
        such that we can perform the search necessary to determine whether or not
        someone associated with the information you provide is using Gametime United.
        If you choose to find your friends through social media sites, then you
        understand that the information these sites provide to use to conduct this type
        of search is governed by their privacy policies and your account settings on
        those sites. If you choose to find your friends through a search of names or
        usernames then simply type a name to search and see if that name or username
        appears on our Service.
      </p>
      <p><b>Analytics information</b>:&nbsp; We may
        directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us
        measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.&nbsp; These tools collect information sent by your
        browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information
        that assists us in improving the Service.&nbsp;
        We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such
        that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual
        user.

        cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.&nbsp; However, some features of the Service may not
        function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
      </p>
      <p><b>Log file information</b>:&nbsp; Log file
        information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each
        time you access the Service.&nbsp; When you
        use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file
        information.&nbsp; These server logs may
        include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol
        (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks
        and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,
        pages viewed, and other such information.

      <p><b>
          Clear gifs/web beacons
          information
        </b>:&nbsp; When you use the Service, we may employ clear
        gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online
        usage patterns of our Users.&nbsp; In
        addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to
        track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.&nbsp; The information is allows for more accurate
        reporting and improvement of the Service.
      </p>
      <p><b>Location data</b>:&nbsp; When you
        access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect,
        monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS
        coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding
        the location of your mobile device.&nbsp;
        Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use
        the Service.&nbsp; Some features of the
        Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use
        or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.
