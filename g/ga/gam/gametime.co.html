        <p><b>1.&nbsp; <u><a id="howwecollectanduseinformation">HOW WE COLLECT AND USE
        INFORMATION</a></u></b></p>

        <p>Capitalized terms that are
        not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of
        Service. </p>

        <p>We collect the following
        types of information about you:</p>

        <p><b>Information you provide
        us directly:</b> We ask for certain
        information such as your username, first and last name, phone number and e-mail
        address when you register for a Gametime United account, or if you correspond
        with us.&nbsp; We may also retain any messages
        you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User
        Content you post to the Service.&nbsp; We use
        this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and
        functionality of the Service.</p>

        <p><b>Information we may
        receive from third parties</b>: We
        may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you
        access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for
        example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the
        Gametime United application, linking your account to the Gametime United
        Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of
        its service to Gametime United.&nbsp; This
        information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with
        your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to
        access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to
        share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that
        service.&nbsp; If you allow us access to your
        friends list, your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may
        be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to
        invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if
        and when your friends join Gametime United. You should always review, and if
        necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services
        before linking or connecting them to the Gametime United Service.&nbsp; You may also unlink your third party account
        from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.&nbsp; If you unlink your third party account, we
        will remove the information collected about you in connection with that
        service.</p>

        <p><b>Inviting a friend to use
        Gametime United from the “Invite friends” feature:</b> If you choose to use our invitation service to
        invite a third party to the Service through our “Invite friends” feature, you
        may directly choose a friend to invite through your mobile device’s native
        contact list - but we do not require that you import your contacts list to the
        Service, and we do not retain the information contained in your contacts list.
        You understand that by inviting a friend to Gametime United through the “Invite
        friends” feature, you are directly sending a text or email from your personal
        accounts and that we are not storing your contact list. In addition, you
        understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent
        from you phone. Since this invitation is coming directly from your email or
        phone, we do not have access to or control this communication. </p>

        <p><b>Finding your friends on
        the Service: </b>If
        you choose, you can locate your friends with Gametime United accounts through
        our “Find friends” feature. The “Find friends” feature allows you to choose to
        locate friends either through (i) your contact list, (ii) social media sites
        (such as Twitter or Facebook) or (iii) through a search of names and usernames
        on Gametime United. If you choose to find your friends through your contact
        list, then you agree to provide Gametime United access to your contact list
        such that we can perform the search necessary to determine whether or not
        someone associated with the information you provide is using Gametime United.
        If you choose to find your friends through social media sites, then you
        understand that the information these sites provide to use to conduct this type
        of search is governed by their privacy policies and your account settings on
        those sites. If you choose to find your friends through a search of names or
        usernames then simply type a name to search and see if that name or username
        appears on our Service.&nbsp; Note that we do
        not retain any information contained in your contacts list, or information from
        social media sites about your contacts, and we do not use such information for
        any purpose other than to help you find your friends on Gametime United.</p>

        <p><b>Analytics information</b>:&nbsp; We may
        directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us
        measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.&nbsp; These tools collect information sent by your
        browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information
        that assists us in improving the Service.&nbsp;
        We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such
        that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual
        user.</p>

        <p><b>Cookies information</b>:&nbsp; When you
        visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file
        containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely
        identifies your browser and lets Gametime United help you log in faster and
        enhance your navigation through the site.&nbsp;
        A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service
        (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on
        the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the
        Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you
        close your browser.&nbsp; Persistent cookies
        may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site.&nbsp; Persistent cookies can be removed by
        following your web browser’s directions.&nbsp;
        A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.&nbsp; You can reset your web browser to refuse all
        cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.&nbsp; However, some features of the Service may not
        function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>

        <p><b>Log file information</b>:&nbsp; Log file
        information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each
        time you access the Service.&nbsp; When you
        use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file
        information.&nbsp; These server logs may
        include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol
        (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks
        and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,
        pages viewed, and other such information.</p>

        <p><b>Clear gifs/web beacons
        information</b>:&nbsp; When you use the Service, we may employ clear
        gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online
        usage patterns of our Users.&nbsp; In
        addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to
        track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.&nbsp; The information is allows for more accurate
        reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>

        <p><b>Location data</b>:&nbsp; When you
        access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect,
        monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS
        coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding
        the location of your mobile device.&nbsp;
        Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use
        the Service.&nbsp; Some features of the
        Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use
        or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.</p>

        <p><b>Commercial and marketing
        communications: </b>We
        use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with
        you.&nbsp; We may send you emails containing
        newsletters, promotions and special offers.&nbsp;
        If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the
        option to opt out or change your preferences.&nbsp;
        We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g.,
        account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders,
        changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security
        notices).&nbsp; You may not opt out of
        Service-related e-mails. You will also be able to be “found” on Gametime United
        based on information that you provide (see “Find friends on Gametime United”)
        above.</p>

        <p><b>Use of&nbsp; certain service type information we collect
        about you: </b>We use or may use
        cookies, log file, location data and clear gifs information to:&nbsp; (a) remember information so that you will not
        have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b)
        provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and
        monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as
        total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or
        fix technology problems; (f) help you efficiently access your information after
        you sign in; and (g) automatically update the Gametime United application on
