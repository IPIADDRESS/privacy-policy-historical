			<div id="inline-31" style="display: none;"><div class="inline" style="padding:10px;font-size:13px;line-height:150%;"><b class="inline2">Dragon Age III influenced by Skyrim</b><br><br><!--[CDATA[ <p-->BioWare's Aaryn Flynn says it would be impossible to develop an RPG today without acknowledging and reacting to Bethesda's game. <p></p><p><img src="http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2012/295/DragonAgeIII2_44181_thumb.jpg">&nbsp;</p><p>
Few concrete details are known concerning BioWare's upcoming <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamespot.com/dragon-age-iii-inquisition/">Dragon Age III: Inquisition, but the developer has now gone on record saying it has been influenced by <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamespot.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Speaking to <i>Game Informer</i> (via <span rel="nofollow" href="http://kotaku.com/5965711/looks-like-dragon-age-3-will-definitely-be-influenced-by-skyrim">Kotaku), BioWare Edmonton and Montreal general manager Aaryn Flynn said it would be impossible to create a role-playing game today without acknowledging and reacting to Bethesda's <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/skyrim-takes-top-honors-at-gdc-awards-6365130">award-winning game. 
</span></span></span></span></p><div class="embscreen">

<p></p><p>
"You can't look at a game like Skyrim and not think about how impressive what they've accomplished is or [think] that's an interesting new direction or that there was something that didn't work well for them that we could take in a new direction," Flynn said. "So, we're always influenced by these games, especially in a relatively tight-knit genre like RPGs."
</p><p>
Dragon Age III: Inquisition is the third entry in BioWare's role-playing game series. It follows 2009's <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/dragon-age-origins/reviews/dragon-age-origins-review-6238631/">Dragon Age: Origins and 2011's <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/dragon-age-ii/reviews/dragon-age-ii-review-6301813/">Dragon Age II. In all, the series has sold more than 8 million units. 
</span></span></p><p>
Last month, BioWare released <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/bioware-releases-dragon-age-iii-inquisition-concept-art-6398652">concept art for Dragon Age III: Inquisition, followed by the <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/first-dragon-age-iii-screenshot-shown-6400096">first, albeit blurry, screenshot. 
</span></span></p><p>
Most recently, an EA Shanghai employee's LinkedIn resume suggested Dragon Age III: Inquisition is targeting a release for <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/dragon-age-iii-for-next-gen-in-2014-6400730">next-generation platforms in 2014.

The first expansion for <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamespot.com/far-cry-3/">Far Cry 3 will release exclusively for the PlayStation 3 version of the game in January 2013. Developer Massive Entertainment announced today through the <span rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/12/04/far-cry-3s-high-tides-dlc-sails-to-ps3-in-january/">PlayStation Blog that the game's High Tides downloadable content will add two new co-op chapters to the action-shooter.
</span></span></p><div class="embscreen">
                                <span rel="nofollow" href="http://au.gamespot.com/pages/image_viewer/index.php?single=1&amp;path=2012%2F338%2FHighTides_56405_screen.jpg&amp;blog=1">

<p></p><p>
These are Jailbreak and Redemption and will take place where the original six co-op chapters left off. "These are the gang?s final moments, and we?re really challenging ourselves to go all-out," the developer said.
</p><p>
Up for grabs in the High Tides expansion are new missions, "tougher fights," larger competitions, and "explosive moments unlike anything you've seen before." No price for the content was announced, and a Ubisoft representative was not immediately available to comment. It is also unclear if the content will be later made available for Xbox 360 and PC gamers.

A GameSpot reader initially tipped the news yesterday, saying Fable II had mysteriously vanished. This person also said those who had previously purchased the game but deleted it, were not able to re-download it. This is no longer the case.

Sony is going to war with <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamespot.com/planetside-2/">PlanetSide 2 hackers.

Smedley called out one specific gamer, saying each of his three accounts had been banned, but not before firing off some harsh words. "Goodbye you scumbag. Find a new hobby or get good at the game," he <span rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/j_smedley/status/275738278190280704">said.

Rockstar Games has released a new title update for <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamespot.com/max-payne-3/">Max Payne 3 that fixes a player invisibility bug, among other issues. As detailed on the company's <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/46421/latest-title-update-for-max-payne-3-now-available-for-download-a.html">blog, the update is now available for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC versions of the game.

<p></p><p>
In addition to scratching the player invisibility bug, the Max Payne 3 update also fixes an issue when players would get stuck in cover, when game modes could appear to be over 100 percent full, and where players encountered trouble loading into a new game when a party member had left. 
</p><p>
Additionally, with the Max Payne 3 update applied, the Kill screen now shows what weapon and burst enemies used to knock players down with. Further, it fixes an issue where on occasion a Loadout slot could overwrite another Loadout slot at the start of a Gang Wars round.

A trailer for Wii U game <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamespot.com/rayman-legends/">Rayman Legends suggested the title would leverage the system's near-field communication (NFC) technology, allowing users to place objects on the GamePad to beam them into the game. However, creative director Michel Ancel has clarified the situation, saying the trailer was only displaying a possible feature, not something concrete.
</span></p><div class="embscreen">
                                <span rel="nofollow" href="http://au.gamespot.com/pages/image_viewer/index.php?single=1&amp;path=2012%2F117%2FRaymanLegends_13328_screen.jpg&amp;blog=1">

<p></p><p>
"We didn't announce this officially and it was more the kind of experiment we do when working on new hardware like the Wii U," Ancel told the <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/44214/rayman-legends-director-wii-u-nfc-could-be-quite-innovative/"><i>Official Nintendo Magazine</i>. "We had prototypes of this and we believe that having real objects manipulating gameplay could be quite innovative. But again, this was a prototype and we won't discuss it until it's ready to demonstrate its full potential."
</span></p><p>
None of the dozens of Wii U launch titles take advantage of the Wii U GamePad's NFC technology. This includes Activision's <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamespot.com/skylanders-giants/">Skylanders Giants, which instead uses its own Portal of Power to bring real-world objects into the game.  
</span></p><p>
Rayman Legends was originally intended to launch in November, but is <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/rayman-legends-delayed-to-2013-6397897">now expected in early 2013.

<span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamespot.com/hitman-absolution/">Hitman: Absolution may have only released last week, but Square Enix is already preparing for the next entry in the series. Concept art for the next game in the stealth-killing franchise has been released (via <span rel="nofollow" href="http://schaffigames.de/news/erste-artworks-zu-hitman-6-gesichtet/">Schaffi Games) by Square Enix art director Rasmus Poulsen and senior concept artist Leonid Enin.
</span></span></p><div class="embscreen">

<p></p><p>
The concept art comes from the Montreal International Game Summit held earlier this month, where it was created live at the show. The shots focus on a character (at right) who does not appear to be Agent 47, the protagonist of past entries in the series. 
</p><p>
It was revealed last week that IO Interactive <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/next-hitman-game-to-be-developed-by-square-enix-montreal-report-6400523">would not develop the next entry in the Hitman series, but rather Square Enix Montreal. Hitman: Absolution director Tore Blystad said, "It's like with Treyarch and Infinity Ward. You have an IP that has been developed. They will feed off each other, as well as some things that stand out. I think with these big franchises, it takes a long time to develop just one game. If you can, work a little bit in parallel at least, and help each other out."

The Omega downloadable content focuses on Aria and her fight to take back Omega with the help of series hero Commander Shepard.

"Forced to rely on Arias unique knowledge of the station and faced with her lust for revenge, how far will you go to retake Omega?" reads a line from the content's announcement.

[UPDATE] Following the publication of this story, Nintendo confirmed the Wii Mini as a Canada-exclusive to be sold through the holiday season. No mention was made of a release in other territories. A <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nintendo.com/wiimini/what-is-wii-mini/">landing page at the company's website confirms the earlier reports. The Wii Mini cannot connect to the Internet or play GameCube games.
</span></p><p>
<i>The original story follows below</i>.
</p><p>
The evidence for the Wii Mini continues to mount. Though Nintendo has not officially announced the hardware revision, <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/first-image-of-wii-mini-revealed-6400628">Best Buy Canada has posted images of the device, and now Future Shop has provided even more details. A post to the retailer's <span rel="nofollow" href="http://community.futureshop.ca/t5/Tech-Blog/Just-Announced-Nintendo-Wii-Mini/ba-p/397656">blog corroborates <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/wii-mini-hitting-december-7-6400570">earlier reports that the Wii Mini will be available December 7, but also reveals a price: $99. The current MSRP for the Wii is <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/wii-drops-to-130-6398236">$130. 
</span></span></span></span></p><div class="embscreen">
                                <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamespot.com/pages/image_viewer/index.php?single=1&amp;path=2012%2F331%2FWiiMinny_36326_screen.jpg&amp;blog=1">

<p></p><p>
The lower price tag does not come without functionality setbacks. The Wii Mini does not include Wi-Fi support, and according to the retailer, will not be able to connect to the Internet at all or make use of online features in games. Additionally, the Wii Mini does not have GameCube functionality. The system is not compatible with GameCube discs, with controller ports and memory slots stripped from the system.
</p><p>
As for the system itself, the Wii Mini will sport a red case with a black matte finish on its top. It will come bundled with a red Wii Remote Plus and matching Nunchuck controllers. The Wii Mini is, as its name suggests, smaller than the original Wii, and requires the unit to be laid flat. The original Wii allowed users to either position the system horizontally or vertically.
 </p><p>
The Wii Mini's power-on button is positioned at the system's bottom left corner, with an Open button on the right. This suggests the Wii Mini will be a top-loading system, similar to the GameCube. 
</p><p>
A Nintendo representative was not immediately available for comment.
</p><p>
If the report is true, it would mark the second Wii redesign, following last year's Europe-only "<span rel="nofollow" href="amzn.to/10X65Nk">Wii Family Edition" bundle. This console did not feature GameCube controller ports. 
</span></p><p>
Last week, Nintendo director of product marketing Bill Trinen said the Wii <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/nintendo-on-wii-u-still-a-lot-to-do-6400343">remains a viable platform because of its large install base. He also suggested Nintendo could spur hardware sales by making the system available "at the right price."
</span></p><p>
"I think there's also the potential for a lot of people who still haven't purchased Wii, believe it or not, who might be interested at the right price," Trinen said at the time. "So we'll probably be looking at it more from that standpoint."

Valve has been pursuing a Half-Life movie for <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/valve-shopping-for-half-life-movie-6071475">nearly a decade, but the project has not gotten rolling. That has not changed, but Valve writer Marc Laidlaw has opened up on who his dream candidates would be to direct a big-screen adaptation of the sci-fi shooter series.
</span></p><div class="embscreen">
                                <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamespot.com/pages/image_viewer/index.php?single=1&amp;path=2012%2F115%2Fgordonfreeman2_55498_screen.jpg&amp;blog=1">

<p></p><p>
"If Paul Verhoeven returned to science fiction films, he would do something insane with Half-Lifemaybe something objectionably insane, but at least not boring. Peter Jackson has proved himself an amazing purveyor of faithful adaptations. Guillermo del Toro has the horror vibe that I think a lot of people miss out on when thinking about a Half-Life movie," Laidlaw said. "Half-Life is essentially horror after all. The science in it barely passes as hand-waving, but when a headcrab jumps at your head, its a precisely engineered jolt."
</p><p>
Verhoeven is most famous for directing <i>Total Recall</i> and <i>Robocop</i>, while Jackson earned his place in film history for the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy. Del Toro directed <i>Pan's Labyrinth </i> and <i>Hellboy</i>
</p><p>
Ultimately, Laidlaw said he believes there are numerous directors who could do the Half-Life fiction justice on the silver screen. However, fans may want to temper their excitement for the film, as Laidlaw said "most of them are busy pursuing their own visions."
</p><p>
The Half-Life movie was first revealed in 2003, following Half-Life 2's showing at the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Valve is looking to for a project that would extend the elements of the game and broaden the franchise's audience, though no other details are available.
</p><p>
 <i>Pulp Fiction</i> and <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> director <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/tarantino-to-direct-half-life-movie-6142692">Quentin Tarantino was reportedly in talks to direct the film, though Valve said this was not the case.

The <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/wii-mini-hitting-december-7-6400570">rumor appears to be right. <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/home.aspx">Best Buy Canada has posted a listing for a Wii Mini, slating the system redesign to launch December 7. An internal document from a "major retailer" first tipped the console, though Nintendo has yet to confirm its existence.
</span></span></p><div class="embscreen">
                                <span rel="nofollow" href="http://uk.gamespot.com/pages/image_viewer/index.php?single=1&amp;path=2012%2F331%2FWiiMini_44331_screen.jpg&amp;blog=1">

<p></p><p>
According to the listing, the Wii Mini (at right) is square-shaped and will be available in a red and black color style. The retailer's website indicates the unit is available for preorder, though clicking the link does not lead to a product page. It is not clear what the Wii Mini will cost. 
</p><p>
Nintendo recently <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/wii-drops-to-130-6398236">dropped the Wii MSRP to $130.

<p></p><p>
The developer took to <span rel="nofollow" href=" https://twitter.com/cactusquid/status/273084286599561216" target="_blank">Twitter this week to tell fans that a preliminary Hotline Miami 2 soundtrack was in the works.
</span></p><p>
"Working while listening to the sweet tunes of a preliminary Hotline Miami 2 soundtrack that we've put together during the weekend," Söderström said.
</p><p>
The comments were later clarified in a <span rel="nofollow" href=" http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-26-hotline-miami-sequel-announced" target="_blank">Eurogamer article, in which Söderström revealed the planned DLC for Hotline Miami eventually turned into a fully-fledged game, which the studio plans to reveal as Hotline Miami 2 rather than DLC for the first game.
</span></p><p>
However, Söderström later <span rel="nofollow" href=" https://twitter.com/cactusquid/status/273175130123952129" target="_blank">Tweeted that the team only has some "general plans" for the next game and that their main priority remains "fixing Hotline Miami".

<p></p><p>
Fans may be wondering why Gearbox is not planning to bring its popular Borderlands franchise to the Wii U. According to CEO Randy Pitchford, it's due to Gearbox not having yet found a compelling way to use the system. 
</p><p>
We get asked if there is going to be a Wii U version of Borderlands, and the reason why theres not is because we couldnt think of a 'natural, obvious OMG-I-want-that-for-what the-Wii-U-brings-to-the-table feature," Pitchford told GamesMaster (via <span rel="nofollow" href="http://nintendoeverything.com/106748/why-borderlands-isnt-on-wii-u/">Nintendo Everything).
</span></p><p>
On the other hand, bringing Aliens: Colonial Marines to the Wii U was an easy decision for Pitchford.
</p><p>
But with Aliens, the first thing we thought was Holy sh*t, I can have a motion controller in my hands! When its there in my lap it feels like Im part of the movie," he said.

"In the end, our competitors need to react to what we're doing in the marketplace and need to figure out what their innovation will be," Fils-Aime told GameSpot sister site <span rel="nofollow" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10797_3-57554148-235/nintendos-fils-aime-microsoft-sony-need-to-react-to-us/">CNET. "It's likely that faster processors and pretty pictures won't be enough to motivate consumers. They need to react to what we've done and we need to continue innovating with the Wii U and we will."

The Wii U <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/features/gamers-embrace-cold-weather-for-wii-u-launch-6400300/">launched in the United States November 18 to sales of 400,000 units during its first week. Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime revealed the sales milestone to GameSpot sister site <span rel="nofollow" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10797_3-57554183-235/nintendo-400k-wii-u-units-sold-1.2m-devices-total/">CNET today, adding that total hardware sales (Wii U, Wii, 3DS, and DS) for the week exceeded 1.2 million units. The original Wii launched in 2006 and sold more than <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/over-600000-wiis-served-6162373">600,000 units during its first eight days on the market in the Americas.

<p></p><p>
In addition to the Wii U's 400,000 units, the aging Wii console moved 300,000 systems during the past week, which included the one-day shopping bonanza known as Black Friday.
</p><p>
 Nintendo's portable devices also prospered last week, with the 3DS moving 250,000 units and DS devices shifting another 275,000 systems. Fils-Aime said the original DS line outpaced sales of the newer 3DS last week due to the numerous Black Friday deals held by various retailers.
</p><p>
Despite being outsold by its predecessor last week, the executive said the <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/3ds-sales-nearing-6-million-in-us-6400326">6 million 3DS units sold through its first 21 months is ahead of the original DS line during the same time by one million units. 
</span></p><p>
According to Fils-Aime, the Wii U's 400,000 first-week sales could have been even higher if stock had been replenished sooner.
</p><p>
"Wii U is essentially sold out of retail and we are doing our best to continually replenish stock," Fils-Aime said. "Retailers are also doing their best to get the product to store shelves. But as soon as product hits retail, they're selling out immediately."
</p><p>
Though the Wii U may be facing shortages right now, Fils-Aime does not foresee the drought to be on par with the original Wii in 2006. 
</p><p>
"Wii was a unique phenomenon. You couldn't walk into a retailer and buy a Wii until spring of 2009," Fils-Aime said. "We've certainly learned many lessons from that and we are replenishing retailers more quickly this time around. We are looking to have as much product into retail as possible. It's driven by consumer response."

Rockstar Games is inviting players to experience <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamespot.com/max-payne-3/">Max Payne 3 Painful Memories next week, the company <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/46381/max-payne-3-painful-memories-dlc-coming-december-4th.html">announced today. The game's Painful Memories expansion arrives December 4 and is free for those with a $30 Rockstar Pass. The content can be purchased separately for $10 on Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and PC.

<p></p><p>
The Painful Memories downloadable content for Max Payne 3 includes four new maps (Roscoe Street Subway, Marty's Bar, Shoot First, and Canal De Panama) for the game's multiplayer component. In addition, the expansion adds the IMG 5.56 and UAR-21 assault rifles, new avatars and items, as well as the Hangover Burst. This causes enemies to respawn with fuzzy vision, and reduced stamina and health.
</p><p>
Max Payne 3's Painful Memories DLC follows previously released expansions Local Justice, Hostage Negotiation, and Disorganized Crime. The fifth and final map pack for the game--Trickle Down Economics--is slated to arrive at a later date.

<span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamespot.com/shadowrun-returns/">Shadowrun Returns will be slower to return than originally expected. Developer Harebrained Schemes <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1613260297/shadowrun-returns/posts/354030">announced through its Kickstarter page recently that the project has been pushed from a release in January 2013 to either May or June 2013. 
</span></span></p><div class="embscreen">
                                <span rel="nofollow" href="http://uk.gamespot.com/pages/image_viewer/index.php?single=1&amp;path=2012%2F330%2FShadow_10401_screen.jpg&amp;blog=1">

<p></p><p>
Producer Mitch Gitelman said Shadowrun Returns' January 2013 release date "might've worked for the scope of the game we originally envisioned, but as our ambitions (read that 'features list') grew, so did the time we needed to deliver." 
</p><p>
Gitelman added that Shadowrun Returns was originally planned with a top-down camera, but that has been swapped out in favor of an isometric point of view. This, according to Gitelman,  took serious research and development time."
</p><p>
Shadowrun Returns will be a single-player 2D turn-based role-playing title. Harebrained Schemes is also promising an interactive story, with narrative work provided by a host of experienced Shadowrun authors and designers.
</p><p>
The game was originally targeted for PC and tablets only, but its Kickstarter campaign finished with $1.8  million, which resulted in Linux and Mac versions of Shadowrun Returns.

Tomb Raider protagonist Lara Croft will have <span rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/tombraider/status/272554645849780225">regenerative health in the game.

 Stewart also addressed a question regarding the possibility of a Tomb Raider sequel. He said "of course" Crystal Dynamics will make a second game if the first is successful.

Third-party games like <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamespot.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/">Call of Duty: Black Ops II look better on Wii U than they do on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3. That's according to Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime, who told <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=137X2LcF-wM">CNN recently that players seeking the best-looking experience would be smart to choose the Wii U version. Responding to a question regarding the Wii U being on par in terms of specifications with the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Fils-Aime said this was not the case.

<p></p><p>
"First off, I have to correct you. The specs are quite different than the competitive systems; much more graphically intensive. If you do a side-by-side comparison you would actually see that third-party like Call of Duty look dramatically better on our system," Fils-Aime said.
</p><p>
Gearbox Software CEO Randy Pitchford said earlier this year that the Wii U version of <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamespot.com/aliens-colonial-marines-2012/">Aliens: Colonial Marines would be the <span rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamespot.com/aliens-colonial-marines-2012/videos/aliens-colonial-marines-interview-with-randy-pitchford-6377485/">best-looking iteration of the game. The title is also planned for Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. 
</span></span></p><p>
Fils-Aime was also asked how Nintendo feels about launching the Wii U just a year before Microsoft and Sony are rumored to have <span rel="nofollow" class="gslink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/next-xbox-playstation-4-due-in-2013-analysts-6380978">new, more capable systems on the market. Ultimately, he said the Wii U's second-screen approach is the "next innovation" and early sales of the system in the Americas are proving this point. 
</span></p><p>
"And then, in terms of what competition is going to do in the future, we'll see," Fils-Aime said. "We know that, based on our development, this two-screen gaming experience really is the next innovation that consumers are gravitating to; it's selling extremely well here in the Americas, already stocks are quite low in the marketplace. And so for us, certainly the consumer is deciding that the innovation is well worth their investment."
