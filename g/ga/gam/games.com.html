            <br>
            <b>What information does Infogrames collect and how will it be used?</b><br>
            <br>In order to give you the best experience on our site, Infogrames 
              may collect information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide 
              it to us. Typically, we may ask a user to submit personal and/or 
              demographic information, and it will usually take the form of either: 
              (1) game-specific registration; (2) community registration; (3) 
              technical product support; (4) placement of an order for goods or 
              services in the event Infogrames launches an online store; (5) sending 
              an e-card to a friend; (6) submitting a question or comment to our 
              webmaster; and/or, (7) personal information submitted in a business 
              capacity (e.g., resumes). The types of information requested for 
              each activity and the way the information is used are detailed below. 
              <br>
            <blockquote>
            <b>Game Specific Registration</b><br>
            <br>
            Almost all game pages that appear on our sites provide you the opportunity 
            to register to receive the latest news and information about a particular 
            game (i.e., Subscription Center). If you choose to subscribe, you 
            may be prompted to submit personal information such as your full name, 
            home address, phone number and email address. Additionally, we may 
            ask you for some demographic information including your age, gender, 
            the game systems you own, and the types of games you play. The information 
            you provide on this registration form will be used to send you, via 
            email, game news and information tailored to your game and platform 
            preferences. In addition, we may use the information to send you notices 
            that contain additional information, discounts, and offers from Infogrames, 
            unless you opt out from receiving such notices at the time of registration 
            or at a later time. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Community Forum Registration</b><br>
            <br>
            To register for membership in our online community, we may ask you 
            to provide personal information such as your email address, and to 
            create a username and password. We may also collect demographic information 
            about you, including your occupation, hobbies and interest, and other 
            preferences. The information that you submit to us for this purpose 
            is used to give you access to our community forums and other community 
            features. <br>
              The ability to participate in the community forums by simply logging 
              in is available to only those Web users that have already created 
              a password during an earlier visit to the community registration 
              area of our site. To login as a member, we may ask you to submit 
              your username and password. This information is collected so that 
              you can access and participate in the community forums without having 
              to reregister. <br>
              Please note that whenever you give out personal information in public 
              areas such as on our community forums, that information can be collected 
              and used by people you don't know. While we strive to protect those 
              who wish to participate in these forums, we cannot guarantee the 
              security of any information you post in these areas. When you register 
              for the community forum, you have the option to make your email 
              address inaccessible to other users of the forum.<br>
            <br>
            <b> Technical Support</b><br>
            <br>To submit a question or problem to our technical support center 
              using Infogrames' email form, you may be asked to provide your first 
              and last name, date of birth, country, state or province, email 
              address, telephone number, the date and location of your purchase, 
              the name of the game in question, the operating system you are having 
              the trouble on, and a description of the problem you are encountering. 
              The information you provide us for this purpose is used to respond 
              to the sender's troubleshooting problem.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Online Store</b><br>
            <br>
            In the event Infogrames launches an online store for its web users, 
            visitors purchasing goods or services may need to provide a valid 
            credit card number and expiration date, in addition to name, mailing 
            and billing addresses, phone number and e-mail address. In the event 
            that we launch such an online store, we may also ask you to create 
            a password so that when you return to our site, you can easily retrieve 
            your shopping cart by logging in. <br>
            <br>
            <b>E-cards</b><br>
            <br>
            Web users who wish to send an e-card to a friend or family member 
            may be asked to provide their name and email address, and the name(s) 
            and email address(es) of the person(s) to whom they wish to send the 
            e-card. After we send the E-card, we do not store the recipients' 
            email addresses or use them for other purposes.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Email to Webmaster</b><br>
            <br>
            Infogrames may collect and temporarily store personal information 
            that you voluntarily submit to us via email correspondence. For example, 
            Infogrames provides a link through which an online visitor can send 
            e-mail to our Webmaster addressing any issue a user encounters when 
            using our Website. Any personal information contained in such email 
            is used by Infogrames for the sole purpose of responding to your questions. 
            Although most e-mail messages are deleted after they are responded 
            to, in certain cases hard copies or data from certain e-mail correspondence 
            may be kept on file for security purposes. Any such copy or data will 
            also be stored in a secure location, and information from these messages 
            will not be used for marketing purposes.<br>
            <br>
            <b> Resumes</b><br>
            <br>Infogrames allows for the online submission of resumes. Personal 
              information collected from resumes will be used solely for the purpose 
              of accepting and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings. 
              Information obtained from resumes may be shared within our company.</blockquote>
            <br>In addition to the uses specified above, we may also use your personal

            <br>Infogrames uses cookies on its Web site. A "cookie" is 
              a small bit of record-keeping information that Web sites often store 
              on a user's computer. Cookies do not include people's names, e-mail 
              addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable;

            <br>Infogrames also keep tracks of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses 
              for safety and security reasons. An IP address is a number that 
              is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every 
              time you log on to the Internet.<br>

            <br>You should be aware that while you are on a website operated by 
              Infogrames, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond 
              our control and for which we are not responsible. Because we cannot 
              guarantee that the privacy policies of these websites meet our high 
              standards and the requirements of the ESRB Privacy Online Program, 
              we recommend that you read the privacy policy of the website to 
              which you link before you submit any personal information.<br>

            <b>Does Infogrames collect personal information from children under 
            13?</b><br>
            <br>
            <u>Collection and Use of Personal Information</u><br>
            <br>
              At this time, we collect and store personal information about children 
              under 13 if it submitted by way of our email support page (accessible 
              from the Technical Support area of our site) and is submitted after 
              we've obtained verifiable parental consent. To determine who is 
              younger than 13 years old and whether parental consent is required, 
              we ask all users of our email support page to submit their age (i.e., 
              date of birth). If given verifiable permission from a parent, Infogrames 
              may collect and store the following types of personal information 
              about a child under 13: first and last name, email address, and 
              telephone number. Infogrames may also collect demographic information 
              about a child such as the country and state in which the child lives, 
              the child's date of birth, and a description of the hardware (e.g., 
              operating system) and/or product the child has encountered a problem 
              with; and, combine such information with the child's personal information. 
              Infogrames will only collect this information if it is voluntarily 
              submitted to us by the child. We do not collect personal information 
              about a child through the use of passive collection mechanisms such 
              as cookies. <br>
              The information collected from a child is used by Infogrames for 
              purposes of diagnosing a child's specific technical problem and 
              providing an acceptable solution, and may be stored for purposes 
              of providing ongoing technical support. From time to time, we may 
              also receive requests relating to Frequently Asked Question documents 
              (FAQ's), Hint documents, and/or patch disks or update disks related 
              to a specific game or games, and we may use the child's contact 
              information to respond to such requests. <br>
            <br>Under no circumstances will we ask the child to provide us more 
              personal information than is reasonably necessary for the child 
              to receive technical support help. <br>
            <u><br>
            Third Parties</u><br>
            <br>
            Infogrames does not disclose personal information about children under 
            13 to third parties. However, this policy does not apply when disclosure 
            is required to provide information to law enforcement agencies or 
            investigations on matters related to public safety, to take precautions 
            against liability, to respond to judicial process, or to protect the 
            security or integrity of our website(s). <br>

            or use of your child's personal information. To do so, please contact
