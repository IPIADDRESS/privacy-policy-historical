		    advertising such as educating the user about the ads he will see, transparency in regards
		    to their placement and data security for the user browsing our web pages.

		    <h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>

		    Our Online Behavioral Advertising compliant partners might use cookies and web beacons through their ads. Cookies are small text files that are placed in the visitor's computer with the purpose of storing their preferences. Cookies cannot damage user files, nor can they read information from a user's hard drive, they are purely "shortcuts" that allow websites to remember users activities on a web site as well as users visits to a site. Since we use third party advertisements to support <strong>www.gamolition.com</strong> , there is a chance the companies running these ads might store your data in cookies, in order to collect advertisement information or protect you from abusive advertising (for example, stopping pop-up scripts from running multiple times from your IP).

		    Because these advertising companies may also collect the personal information stated above, we at <strong>www.gamolition.com</strong> make sure we only use trustworthy 3rd parties, in order to protect our users.

		    <strong>www.gamolition.com</strong> is displaying advertisements on the game pages, ads from Google Adsense, ValueClick Media, CPM Star  and other advertising vendors. Google offers child safe targeted ads to our users. Google is also using the DART cookie to collect information about every user. This cookie does not store any personal data or sensitive information and can be removed by you searching the cookie in the cookies folder of your browser on your PC. If you as a parent or as a user find ads that are not appropriate for children please notify us at once.

		    In general, these cookies and web beacons are used for research purposes and for geo-targeting and behavioral targeting of the ads. If you feel uncomfortable providing this kind of information to our advertisers through cookies, you can turn them off from your preferred browser's settings, or manage them through Internet Security software (such as Norton Internet Security for example).

		    <h3>External Links</h3>

		    Our site has several external links pointing to our partners, or the flash games we post on our site might have in-game links to other sites that might offer content that we have no control over. Unfortunately, we cannot take responsibility for the content shown by our partners, although we only pick to link to related, quality websites that are non-intrusive and offer clean content suitable for our target audience.

		    Advertising on <strong>www.gamolition.com</strong>

		    <strong>www.gamolition.com</strong> offers advertisement places in several places across the website. These ad spots show Google Adsense Ads, ValueClick Media or other ads and are child friendly.

		    <h3>Opt out Mechanism</h3>

		    All sites using advertisements provided by companies that adhered to the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) must provide an opt-out button that will allow users to no longer receive online advertising. In order to opt out from the advertisements provided by our NAI compliant partners, please use the opt-out form provided by the organization.

		    <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
