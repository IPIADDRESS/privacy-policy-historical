  We have information about your use of our GameShadow services (such as the amount of time you are connected to the service). &nbsp;We mainly use this information to manage our network. &nbsp;However, we may also use this information for marketing Aardwork Software Ltd's services. &nbsp;We do not disclose this information to anyone other than to our agents who process it on our behalf. &nbsp;Your decision on whether you want to receive details of other Aardwork Software Ltd products and services made when you register for or order a service also applies to this information. Consequently, if you do not wish us to use this information for marketing purposes but during registration elected to receive details on other Aardwork Software Ltd products and services, you will need to write to <a href="mailto:marketing@gameshadow.com">marketing@gameshadow.com </a> and request that you opt-out from us using your information for marketing purposes. </p>
                      <p>When you use the GameShadow service, all the deductive logic to determine the versions of your games is conducted locally on your PC.&nbsp; We do not transfer or transmit any game related information held on your computer or network to the Aardwork servers. </p>
                      <p>As with most (if not all) website operators, we also collect anonymous information from visitors to our website and registered customers to help us improve our website and the services we make available. &nbsp;This anonymous information tells us, for instance, how many visitors there were to our website, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our website they went visited. &nbsp;This information helps us to assess which parts of our website are popular or need improving. &nbsp;We may share this aggregate data with our advertisers and other companies which offer their goods or services on our website so that they can see how effective our website is as a sales channel for their products. &nbsp;Remember though that they, and we, cannot see which individuals this data relates to - it only shows the usage patterns of a particular PC. </p>

  We use "cookies" on our Forums to collect anonymous information from visitors to our website and registered customers. &nbsp;A "cookie" is a text file which is allocated by our server to your PC when you visit our website. &nbsp;The text file contains a random number which, unless the cookie is deleted, allows us to identify your PC if you visit our website again. </p>
                      <p>Our servers use two different types of cookies. &nbsp;The first type is known as a "session-based" cookie and is allocated to your PC only for the duration of your visit to our website. &nbsp;It helps you to move around the website faster and, if you are a registered customer or subscriber, it allows us to give you information relevant to GameShadow. &nbsp;This cookie automatically expires when you close down your browser. </p>
                      <p>Other companies which advertise or offer their products or services on our website may also allocate cookies to your PC. &nbsp;The types of cookies they use and how they use the information generated by them will be governed by those companies' privacy policies, not ours. </p>
                      <p>All types of cookies can be removed from your PC. &nbsp;However, if you do this there is likely to be a deterioration of your experience of our website (e.g.: you may end up being shown endless numbers of pop up boxes containing the same advertisements or not being able to see a personalised page). &nbsp;Your browser lets you choose whether to accept, not to accept, or to be warned before accepting cookies. &nbsp;These settings can be found in the advanced preferences - <br>

  We sometimes have to share your personal information with other companies which we use to provide some of our own services. &nbsp;For example, we use specialist companies to conduct market research on our behalf to see how we can improve the services we offer to our customers. &nbsp;We would need to give those companies your personal information so that they can contact you to see if you'd like to participate in our market research. &nbsp;However, those companies can only process this information according to the instructions we give them. </p>
                      <p>We also share your personal information with other parts of Aardwork Software Ltd or other companies so that they (or we, on their behalf) can contact you with details of other products or services you may be interested in. &nbsp;We will only do this if you have agreed to receive this information. &nbsp;During your registration as a GameShadow customer, or if you enter a promotion or competition on our website, you can decide whether you would like this information. </p>
