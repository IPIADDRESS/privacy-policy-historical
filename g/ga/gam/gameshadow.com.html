              <p>However, in addition to our legal obligations, we have developed this Privacy Policy because we want you to feel confident about the privacy and security of the personal information you disclose to us when you register for our services or, as a visitor, enter into any of our competitions or promotions. &nbsp;If you only browse our website we do not collect any personal information from you but we may gather anonymous information (using cookies) to help make your visit to our website more satisfying. &nbsp;Please see "Other information we collect" for more information on how we do this. </p>
              <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. &nbsp;If you are visiting our website or using our services, you indicate your agreement to our use of your personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy by continuing to use our website. &nbsp;If you want to register for or order one of our services, you will also be asked to accept this Privacy Policy during registration. </p>
              <p><strong><font color="#990000">What does this Privacy Policy cover? </font></strong><br>
  This Privacy Policy only applies to our website and services. &nbsp;It does not apply to any third party or other GameShadow Limited sites whichGameShadow Limited may host or which you may access from our website or any other GameShadow Limited or third party services.

              <p>Once in a while we may receive personal information about you from third parties. &nbsp;Except in the cases where we are merely processing such information on their behalf, such third parties should have requested your consent for us to use this information. </p>

              <p><strong><font color="#990000">What other information do we collect? </font></strong><br>
  We have information about your use of our GameShadow services (such as the amount of time you are connected to the service). We mainly use this information to manage our network.&nbsp;However, we may also use this information for marketing GameShadow Limited's services. &nbsp;We do not disclose this information to anyone other than to our agents who process it on our behalf.&nbsp;Your decision on whether you want to receive details of other GameShadow Limited products and services made when you register for or order a service also applies to this information. Consequently, if you do not wish us to use this information for marketing purposes but during registration elected to receive details on other GameShadow Limited products and services, you will need to write to <a href="mailto:marketing@gameshadow.com">marketing@gameshadow.com </a> and request that you opt-out from us using your information for marketing purposes. </p>
              <p>When you use the GameShadow service, all the deductive logic to determine the versions of your games is conducted locally on your PC. We do not transfer or transmit any game related information held on your computer or network to the GameShadow servers. </p>
              <p>As with most (if not all) website operators, we also collect anonymous information from visitors to our website and registered customers to help us improve our website and the services we make available.&nbsp;This anonymous information tells us, for instance, how many visitors there were to our website, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our website they went visited.&nbsp;This information helps us to assess which parts of our website are popular or need improving. We may share this aggregate data with our advertisers and other companies which offer their goods or services on our website so that they can see how effective our website is as a sales channel for their products. Remember though that they, and we, cannot see which individuals this data relates to - it only shows the usage patterns of a particular PC. </p>

              <p><strong><font color="#990000">How do we collect anonymous information? </font></strong><br>
  We use "cookies" on our Forums to collect anonymous information from visitors to our website and registered customers.&nbsp;A "cookie" is a text file which is allocated by our server to your PC when you visit our website. The text file contains a random number which, unless the cookie is deleted, allows us to identify your PC if you visit our website again. </p>
              <p>Our servers use two different types of cookies. &nbsp;The first type is known as a "session-based" cookie and is allocated to your PC only for the duration of your visit to our website. It helps you to move around the website faster and, if you are a registered customer or subscriber, it allows us to give you information relevant to GameShadow. This cookie automatically expires when you close down your browser. </p>
              <p>Other companies which advertise or offer their products or services on our website may also allocate cookies to your PC. The types of cookies they use and how they use the information generated by them will be governed by those companies' privacy policies, not ours. </p>
              <p>All types of cookies can be removed from your PC. However, if you do this there is likely to be a deterioration of your experience of our website (e.g.: you may end up being shown endless numbers of pop up boxes containing the same advertisements or not being able to see a personalised page). &nbsp;Your browser lets you choose whether to accept, not to accept, or to be warned before accepting cookies. &nbsp;These settings can be found in the advanced preferences - <br>

              <p><strong><font color="#990000">Do we share your personal information with anyone else? </font></strong><br>
  We sometimes have to share your personal information with other companies which we use to provide some of our own services.&nbsp;For example, we use specialist companies to conduct market research on our behalf to see how we can improve the services we offer to our customers. We would need to give those companies your personal information so that they can contact you to see if you'd like to participate in our market research. However, those companies can only process this information according to the instructions we give them. </p>
              <p>We also share your personal information with other parts of GameShadow Limited or other companies so that they (or we, on their behalf) can contact you with details of other products or services you may be interested in. &nbsp;We will only do this if you have agreed to receive this information. &nbsp;During your registration as a GameShadow customer, or if you enter a promotion or competition on our website, you can decide whether you would like this information. </p>
              <p>If you agree to receive information about other companies' products and services, we will only share your personal information with those companies if they agree to use your personal information only for that purpose. </p>

              <p>To the extent required by law, we will disclose your personal information to law enforcement and other government agencies. You should also be aware that if you are a registered customer and we find that you are using our services for illegal purposes, we may investigate how you are doing so and prohibit you from using the service.&nbsp; We may ultimately notify the police. If we receive a Court Order requesting us to reveal your identity to someone complaining that you have used our service abusively, we will do so. </p>
              <p>If there is a change (or prospective change) in the ownership of GameShadow Limited or any of its assets, we may have to disclose personal information to the new (or prospective) owner. </p>
