        <br>
        By registering as a member of a GameBattles Site, you agree to accept this Privacy Policy and are aware that our policy may change over time as discussed below.<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        B. Membership Information. When you register for membership on one of our sites, we ask for information about you and your interests. We do this so we can better understand what you like and tailor the site to suit you better. At a minimum, we require your name, birth date, gender, email address and zip code. The more information you volunteer, the more we can tailor the site and promotions to your interests. <br>
        o	Service Providers. We also offer our members other services provided by third parties such as free email and free userpages, among others. When you register for membership on an GameBattles Site or activate a service by clicking on a particular service link (i.e. email) on our sites, you may be automatically registered to receive the free services we offer and some of your Personally Identifiable Information may be transferred from GameBattles to those third-party service providers. By becoming a member, you authorize us and our third-party service providers to send you email updates and information about promotions and special offers. We take care to require that our third-party service providers only use our member's data as necessary to provide the particular service and to give you updates on that service provider's products and services. <br>
        <br>
        o	Co-registration with Other Sites. As a member, we offer you the ability to co-register with select third-party partner sites. In some instances where GameBattles provides co-registration, the co-registration partners allow you to opt-out of their membership. If you choose to co-register with our partners and accept their terms of service, then you are automatically registered as a member of their select web sites and your Personally Identifiable Information is transferred to those organizations. As a result, you mayreceive information from one of these web sites as any of their members would. We advise you to review their privacy and data collection policies for further information. In order to cancel your membership with any of these partners you will need to go directly to the partner's site. <br>
        <br>
        o	Advertisers. By becoming a member, you authorize GameBattles to share your Personally Identifiable Information with our advertisers. Our advertisers may use your Personally Identifiable Information to send you, via email or postal mail, advertisements or other notices, and it is possible that your information may be shared with others. <br>
        C. Email Updates to Members. If you so elect at registration, the GameBattles Sites will periodically send you promotional email about services offered by the GameBattles Sites, our partners and advertisers. If you want to update your email address or stop receiving these types of promotional emails, please follow the procedures to unsubscribe at the bottom of any email we send you or simply visit http://my.GameBattles.com to update your profile.<br>
        <br>
        The GameBattles Sites may contact you regarding account status, changes to the user agreement, and to confirm registration. <br>
        <br>
        D. Promotions. We may ask you for Personally Identifiable Information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you enter sweepstakes, contests or promotions sponsored by a third party. If you choose to enter sweepstakes, contests or promotions of this nature, we may share your Personally Identifiable Information with the third party so they can contact you. The third party may use that information to send you advertisements or other notices, and it is possible that your information may be shared with others.<br>
        <br>
        E. Surveys and User Research. GameBattles conducts email and web-delivered surveys from time to time, as well as instant polls, to gather information about our audience. It is important to remember that taking these surveys and polls is entirely optional. You have no obligation to respond to them. We share only the aggregate results of these surveys, not individual data, with our advertisers and partners to help them better understand our services and monitor the reach of their advertising on our service. We also store some of the information that our users provide in these surveys to help us understand your interests and to make the site more useful for you.<br>
        <br>
        F. Use of Cookies. On the Internet, a "cookie" is a piece of information (a file) that a Web site transfers to a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common on the Internet. The process we use to serve advertisements and to track use of our site involves cookies. Cookies help GameBattles and our advertising service (discussed below) track the frequency and placement of advertisements. Cookies also enable us to measure aggregate, or total usage and traffic to our site and to specific offerings. This aids us in producing content that best meets our users' preferences. In order to implement new services, we may use other types of cookies as well. We also may use cookies to understand better what parts of our site you like best. We may use that information to display advertisements that we think will be of particular interest to you. You may configure your browser to reject cookies, but this may interfere with some functionality of the GameBattles Sites. To find out more about changing your browser to reject cookies, we suggest the EPIC Cookies Page [http://www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies].<br>
        <br>
        G. Sites You Visit. As you access our Affiliate Sites and browse around the GameBattles Sites, GameBattles may store information about which pages and which Affiliate Sites you visit and other information presented in your browser's URL address line. GameBattles will use this information to help determine what our users are most interested in.<br>
        <br>
        H. Other Third Parties. GameBattles may share non-personal, aggregate, or summary, information regarding our users with other third parties not mentioned in this policy. This kind of information does not identify you individually.<br>
        <br>
        I. Merger or Acquisition. In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of all or substantially all of its assets, or the sale of an individual website owned by GameBattles, GameBattles may transfer your Personally Identifiable Information to a third party as a part of such merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale.<br>
        <br>
        J. Legal Authorities. The GameBattles Sites may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information in cases when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify someone who may be violating GameBattles's User Agreement or may be causing injury to GameBattles's rights or property, other users, or anyone else. The GameBattles Sites may disclose Personally Identifiable Information of our users to government authorities at our discretion. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Access to Other Sites Through GameBattles</b><br>

These sites are identified as our "Affiliates" and/or - "Partner Sites" These sites are not owned or operated by GameBattles, but are part of a larger network of sites with which the GameBattles Sites share content and advertising opportunities. We do not share Personally Identifiable Information of our members with these Affiliate Sites.<br>
        <br>
        Linking to Other Sites. You may also visit independent web sites, not operated by GameBattles, that are connected to our network for our users. Such sites are operated by external, third-party service providers. Some of these sites will have their own separate membership processes and privacy policies. The GameBattles Sites do not control sites that are operated by others and so cannot be responsible for the information practices of these sites. Other sites may set their own cookies, collect data or solicit personal information. It is always a good idea to check the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use of any site before offering any of your personal information.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Security</b><br>
        <br>
        The GameBattles Sites use diligent efforts to protect the security and integrity of the information you provide to us once it is received on our systems. However, when you submit information about yourself to the GameBattles Sites over the Internet, the information may travel over many systems that are not under the control of GameBattles.
