        <br>
        This Privacy Policy applies to the web sites owned by GameBattles, Inc. including GameBattles.com, Socom2Battles.com, MaddenBattles.com, FifaBattles.com, SocomBattles.com and GhostReconBattles.com. We refer to these web sites as the GameBattles Sites.<br>
        <br>
        While the GameBattles Sites offer different combinations of services and tools from one site to another, this policy states GameBattles's company-wide Privacy Policy with regard to data-collection practices.<br>
        <br>
        By registering as a member of a GameBattles Site, you agree to accept this Privacy Policy and are aware that our policy may change over time as discussed below.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Overview of our Policy</b><br>
        <br>
        The security of personal information is a high priority at GameBattles. We maintain these web sites and all associated data with technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification and improper disclosure. No computer system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard. But GameBattles is committed to providing reasonable and appropriate security controls to protect our web sites and their information against foreseeable hazards.<br>

It also enables us to provide you updates about our services and special offers from our partners. When you become a registered member of one of our sites, you may receive email or postal mail from GameBattles and our partners.<br>
        <br>
        Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information in public areas of an GameBattles Site, such as the member home pages and message boards, your information can be viewed and possibly used by others. We advise users not to disclose information that can be used to contact the user ("Personally Identifiable information") that they do not wish for others to obtain, such as full name, home address, or phone number.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Changes to this Policy</b><br>
        <br>
        This Privacy Policy will always be available to users on this page for you to read. We will update this privacy and fair information practices policy to reflect new features, services and options, as well as any other changes with regard to the use of personal information.

By registering as a member of an GameBattles Site, you agree to accept this Privacy Policy and are aware that our policy may change over time. Continued use of the GameBattles Sites or other GameBattles services will sGameBattlesify that you agree to these changes. <br>
        <br>
        <b>About Children</b><br>
        <br>
        The GameBattles Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13. The GameBattles Sites prohibit registration by and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. This requirement will be posted at points of data collection within the GameBattles Sites, such as registration for services.<br>
        <br>
        Note to Parents. If you have any concerns about the GameBattles Sites or its related services, please contact us via our online form, available at http://www.GameBattles.com/email.html.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
        <br>
        Below are more details about the information the GameBattles Sites gather from you and how we use it.<br>
        <br>
        A. Email Newsletters. GameBattles offers email newsletters. Only registered users will be able to receive newsletters. We will use your email address only to send you the newsletter(s) that you sGameBattlesed up for. If you want to update your email address or stop receiving our newsletter, follow the procedures to unsubscribe at the bottom of any newsletter we send you or simply visit http://my.GameBattles.com to update your profile.<br>
        <br>
        B. Membership Information. When you register for membership on one of our sites, we ask for information about you and your interests. We do this so we can better understand what you like and tailor the site to suit you better. At a minimum, we require your name, birth date, gender, email address and zip code. The more information you volunteer, the more we can tailor the site and promotions to your interests. <br>
        o	Service Providers. We also offer our members other services provided by third parties such as free email and free userpages, among others. When you register for membership on an GameBattles Site or activate a service by clicking on a particular service link (i.e. email) on our sites, you may be automatically registered to receive the free services we offer and some of your Personally Identifiable Information may be transferred from GameBattles to those third-party service providers. By becoming a member, you authorize us and our third-party service providers to send you email updates and information about promotions and special offers. We take care to require that our third-party service providers only use our member's data as necessary to provide the particular service and to give you updates on that service provider's products and services. <br>
        <br>
        o	Co-registration with Other Sites. As a member, we offer you the ability to co-register with select third-party partner sites. In some instances where GameBattles provides co-registration, the co-registration partners allow you to opt-out of their membership. If you choose to co-register with our partners and accept their terms of service, then you are automatically registered as a member of their select web sites and your Personally Identifiable Information is transferred to those organizations. As a result, you mayreceive information from one of these web sites as any of their members would. We advise you to review their privacy and data collection policies for further information. In order to cancel your membership with any of these partners you will need to go directly to the partner's site. <br>
        <br>
        o	Advertisers. By becoming a member, you authorize GameBattles to share your Personally Identifiable Information with our advertisers. Our advertisers may use your Personally Identifiable Information to send you, via email or postal mail, advertisements or other notices, and it is possible that your information may be shared with others. <br>
        C. Email Updates to Members. If you so elect at registration, the GameBattles Sites will periodically send you promotional email about services offered by the GameBattles Sites, our partners and advertisers. If you want to update your email address or stop receiving these types of promotional emails, please follow the procedures to unsubscribe at the bottom of any email we send you or simply visit http://my.GameBattles.com to update your profile.<br>
        <br>
        The GameBattles Sites may contact you regarding account status, changes to the user agreement, and to confirm registration. <br>
        <br>
        D. Promotions. We may ask you for Personally Identifiable Information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you enter sweepstakes, contests or promotions sponsored by a third party. If you choose to enter sweepstakes, contests or promotions of this nature, we may share your Personally Identifiable Information with the third party so they can contact you. The third party may use that information to send you advertisements or other notices, and it is possible that your information may be shared with others.<br>
        <br>
        E. Surveys and User Research. GameBattles conducts email and web-delivered surveys from time to time, as well as instant polls, to gather information about our audience. It is important to remember that taking these surveys and polls is entirely optional. You have no obligation to respond to them. We share only the aggregate results of these surveys, not individual data, with our advertisers and partners to help them better understand our services and monitor the reach of their advertising on our service. We also store some of the information that our users provide in these surveys to help us understand your interests and to make the site more useful for you.<br>
        <br>
        F. Use of Cookies. On the Internet, a "cookie" is a piece of information (a file) that a Web site transfers to a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common on the Internet. The process we use to serve advertisements and to track use of our site involves cookies. Cookies help GameBattles and our advertising service (discussed below) track the frequency and placement of advertisements. Cookies also enable us to measure aggregate, or total usage and traffic to our site and to specific offerings. This aids us in producing content that best meets our users' preferences. In order to implement new services, we may use other types of cookies as well. We also may use cookies to understand better what parts of our site you like best.
