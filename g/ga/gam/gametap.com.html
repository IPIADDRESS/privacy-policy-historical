		 			GameTap Online Privacy Policy
				</p>
				<p>
					Thank you for visiting GameTap.  Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this website and the GameTap service.  
				</p>
				<p class="textTemplateSection">
		 			The Information We Collect
				</p>
				<p>
					At some Time Warner sites, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. 
				</p>
				<p>
					At some other Time Warner sites, you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card, to send a link or message to a friend about GameTap products or services, or this site, or other material, and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.
				</p>
				<p>
					At certain parts of some of our sites, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages or  when you utilize the GameTap service, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows '95 or Mac OS ) the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink), your activities while visiting our web pages, and your activities while using the GameTap service (e.g., which of our web pages you viewed, or which games within the GameTap service you played, etc.).  Functions within the GameTap desktop application will automatically transmit this data back to us on a regular basis.
				</p>
				
				<p class="textTemplateSection">
		 			How We Use the Information
				</p>
				
				<p>
					We may use the information you provide about yourself and any other information we collect about you to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings (including, without limitation, customer service inquiries), and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for customer service assistance, for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.   
				</p>
				<p>
					We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts, messages, or cards. From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs, or services to them. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The information we collect in connection with the GameTap service and our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate your participation and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services. 
				</p>
				<p>
					If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a "letter to our editors"), we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We sometimes use information that we collect to improve the design and content of our service and to enable us to personalize your experience with us. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations or our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Agents and contractors of Time Warner who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Time Warner. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Certain Time Warner sites may disclose personally identifiable information to companies whose practices are not covered by this privacy notice (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations) that may want to market products or services to you. If we share personally identifiable information with third parties, we will provide you with notice prior to sharing such information. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We may on occasion combine information we receive online with outside records to enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that may be of interest to you. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, GameTap will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses. 
				</p>
				
				<p class="textTemplateSection">
		 		Cookies and Web Beacons  
				</p>

				<p>
					To enhance your experience with our websites and the GameTap service, many of our web pages use "cookies" and “web beacons.” Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.   We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages ( e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services. 
				</p>
				<p>
					"Web beacons" or clear.gifs are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We may use web beacons on this site from time to time for this and other purposes.   
				</p>
				
				<p class="textTemplateSection">
		 		Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers and Sponsors 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					GameTap and other Time Warner websites contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. 
				</p>
				<p>
					GameTap and other Time Warner websites sometimes may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that is sponsored by or cobranded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. Time Warner has no control over these third parties' use of this information. The Time Warner site will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information. 
				</p>
				<p>
					GameTap and other Time Warner websites may use a reputable third party to present or serve the advertisements that you may see at its Web pages. These third party ad servers may use cookies, web beacons, clear .gifs or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements’ effectiveness. The use of these technologies by these third party ad servers is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our privacy policy. For more information on such third-party ad servers, please <a href="#sites" id="request_link">click here</a>.

				<p class="textTemplateSection">
		 			Our Commitment to Security

					We put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in an effort to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.

		 			Special Note for Parents
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Visitors to GameTap’s website may participate in activities without providing any personally identifiable information.  However, if a user wants to receive emails from GameTap, or wants to access GameTap’s broadband gaming network, we ask the user to provide us with personal information, including name, screen name, e-mail address, gender, and/or age information.  If a visitor to GameTap’s website self-identifies as under 13 years of age, we will either collect no personally identifiable information from that individual, inform the child that a parent's verifiable consent is required, or we will collect the e-mail address of the user's parent in addition to the user's e-mail address.  We use the parent's e-mail address to seek the parent's verifiable consent or notify the parent of his/her child's online activities and enable the parent to unsubscribe his/her child from a newsletter or other similar activity.   For children joining the GameTap service, we will ask parents to create sub accounts and obtain their prior consent prior to collecting personally identifiable information from their children.  If a user is under 13, we will not condition his/her participation in an online activity on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.  We do not share children's personally identifiable information with outside third parties not bound by this privacy notice for their own marketing purposes. 
				</p>
				<p>
