							<h1>Gamestar Mechanic - Privacy Policy</h1>

<form>
	<div class="wide tall" style="overflow:auto">Gamestar Mechanic is an online service that allows users to play, design and share online games. This policy covers how we treat the information we collect and receive from you. Our goal is to create a safe, entertaining and educational online environment that complies with the United States Federal Trade Commission's Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule, effective April 21, 2000.<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 16, 2011. In the future, our site or our practices may change. When we make changes related to privacy, we will revise this Privacy Policy to reflect the changes. We'll post the updated version here, and we'll notify you if we think the changes will significantly impact the treatment of information you have already provided.<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy applies to the version of Gamestar Mechanic that is open to registration and use by members of the general public. We also make private “realms” of the service available to certain organizations or groups, and it is the responsibility of those organizations or groups to inform their users if their own privacy policies differ from this one. Users within these realms should contact their Realm Administrator for more information.<br>
<br>
<strong>Information we collect</strong><br>
<br>
<em>Information you provide to us</em><br>
<br>
When you register for a Gamestar Mechanic account, we ask for and store certain personal information: a username, a password, birthdate and an email address. We do not require any additional personal information from our users such as name, address or telephone number. We only collect the information that is necessary to allow our users to use the features of Gamestar Mechanic.<br>
<br>
We also ask for your birthdate when you register in order to comply with federal guidelines for protecting children. We may also use your birthdate for the purpose of sending you a special gift on your birthday. We will not use your birthdate for any other promotional purposes.<br>
<br>
For users registering free accounts who enter a birthdate that indicates they are children, we ask for a parent or guardian’s email address. This parent/guardian email address is used right away to notify the parent/guardian that their child has registered to use Gamestar Mechanic and to obtain consent from the parent/guardian for the child to use Gamestar Mechanic. For users registering Premium Accounts who enter a birthdate that indicates they are children, the consent of the parent or guardian is obtained during the process of completing the premium purchase. <br>
<br>
We will only use email addresses we collect for communication directly related to Gamestar Mechanic, and every email we send will have clear opt-out instructions.  Furthermore, we will never share these email addresses with any third party.<br>
<br>
Gamestar Mechanic account holders can view the personal information they have provided to us any time they are logged into their account by going to their profile page. At any time, you may request that your personal information be removed from our system and your account be disabled, either from your profile page or by sending a request to <a href="/help/report" onmouseover="javascript:this.href=ob_e('gamestarmechanic%2Acom', 'support', true);" onfocus="javascript:this.href=ob_e('gamestarmechanic%2Acom', 'support', true);"><script type="text/javascript">document.write(ob_e('gamestarmechanic%2Acom', 'support', false));</script></a>. If you make such a request, we will disable your account and remove the personal information from our system so that it cannot be used in the future.<br>
<br>
<em>Information we track</em><br>
<br>
When you visit the site and use different features of Gamestar Mechanic, our automated software and tools routinely collect information such as IP address, browser type and site usage (for example: what pages are accessed, how much time was spent on each page, etc…).<br>
<br>
<em>Community features</em><br>
<br>
As you use Gamestar Mechanic, you will have the option to participate in an online community with other users. Community features include<br>
<br>
•	Sharing games you have created with other users<br>
•	Sharing an online profile with other users<br>
•	Posting comments, reviews or ratings for your games or games shared by other users<br>
<br>
All of these activities are optional, and our goal is to make them part of the safe, fun and educational Gamestar Mechanic experience. Your participation in these activities – as with all of Gamestar Mechanic – is governed by the Rules of Conduct, which describe the acceptable ways to use our site.<br>
<br>
We do not ask for or collect any personal information from you in the course of your using the Community Features. In fact, the Terms of Service and Rules of Conduct specifically prohibit users from sharing personal information through Community Features. We make every effort to enforce these rules through electronic tools, selective monitoring by our staff and investigating reports from our community members. You should understand, however, that any information you choose to share through Community Features may be accessible by anyone who uses our site.<br>
<br>
<em>Sharing features</em><br>
<br>
In certain parts of the Gamestar Mechanic site, you may have the option of sharing something you’ve created or like using an “Invite a Friend” feature. In this case, you will be asked to submit your name and email address, as well as your friend’s name and email address. This information will be used only to send the message you requested, and will not be stored or maintained by Gamestar Mechanic.<br>
<br>
<em>Paid Subscribers</em><br>
<br>
We require users subscribing to the paid version Gamestar Mechanic to provide us with the information we need to process their payments such as name, address, telephone number and information about the method of payment. We may securely store this information in our system for the purposes of automating future payments and providing customer service. This information pertains to the individual making the purchase, who must be eighteen or older and who may or may not be the actual user of Gamestar Mechanic. Specific terms of use related to Paid Subscribers are described in the Subscriber Agreement.<br>
<br>
<em>Cookies</em><br>
<br>
In common with many websites, Gamestar Mechanic places small files known as “cookies” on our users’ machines. Cookies allow Gamestar Mechanic to provide a convenient experience for our users by keeping track of user identities as they navigate to different parts of the Gamestar Mechanic site. <br>
<br>
For the best user experience, we recommend that you configure your web browser to accept cookies from Gamestar Mechanic. It is possible to configure your web browser not to accept cookies, but this may cause some features of Gamestar Mechanic not to work properly.<br>
<br>
<strong>How we use this information</strong><br>
<br>
We use the information we collect to enable site features; respond to your requests and provide customer service; let you know about new features and other news from Gamestar Mechanic; ask for your input and feedback on what we are doing; and provide personalized services and recommendations.<br>
<br>
We may contact you via email to share information that we think will be of interest to you such as new features, product updates and contests. If you would prefer not to receive these updates, you may opt out of them at any time by changing the notification settings on your account settings page. Each of these emails also contains instructions for how to opt out. If you opt out of these notices, you will still receive email from us related specifically to your usage of the site: for example in response to a customer service request.<br>
<br>
We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally identifiable site usage data to improve the quality and design of the Site and to create new features, promotions, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends.<br>
<br>
<em>Third parties</em><br>
<br>
As part of our regular business conduct, we may securely share information with companies or individuals providing services or acting on our behalf, such as companies providing payment processing, technological or fulfillment services.<br>
<br>
Outside of these specific circumstances, we never share your personally identifiable information with third parties. This includes not sharing your personal information with third parties for commercial or marketing purposes.<br>
<br>
Occasionally, we may share non-personally identifiable data with third parties such as sponsors or academic researchers who are conducting research involving Gamestar Mechanic. In these circumstances, we only share data in ways that do not result in the third parties obtaining our users’ personal information.<br>
<br>
<strong>How to contact us</strong><br>

If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, you can contact us via email at <a href="/help/report" onmouseover="javascript:this.href=ob_e('gamestarmechanic%2Acom', 'support', true);" onfocus="javascript:this.href=ob_e('gamestarmechanic%2Acom', 'support', true);"><script type="text/javascript">document.write(ob_e('gamestarmechanic%2Acom', 'support', false));</script></a> or at<br>
