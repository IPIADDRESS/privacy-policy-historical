<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is intended to explain our privacy practices and covers the following areas:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; When This Privacy Policy Applies.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; United States of America Governing Law.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Collection and Use of Personal Information and Other Information (Other than Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional Opportunities).</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Opting-out of Certain Uses of your Personal Information and Other Information (Other than Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional Opportunities).</p>

<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; Miscellaneous.</p>

<p><strong>1. When This Privacy Policy Applies. </strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies whether you: (i) are accessing the Site via a personal computer, a mobile device or any other technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered (each, a "<u>Device</u>"); and/or (ii) you are accessing the Site as a registered user (if offered by the Site) or other user of the Site. <strong>THIS PRIVACY POLICY GOVERNS ONLY THE PERSONAL INFORMATION AND OTHER INFORMATION (AS THOSE TERMS ARE DEFINED BELOW) COLLECTED BY THE SITE AND DOES NOT COVER ANY SUCH INFORMATION COLLECTED IN ANY OTHER MANNER (SUCH AS BY DEFY MEDIA, LLC NOT THROUGH THE SITE) OR BY ANY OTHER WEBSITE OFFERED BY DEFY AND/OR ANY SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OF DEFY (COLLECTIVELY, "<u>AFFILIATES</u>") OR COLLECTED BY ANY OTHER COMPANY, UNLESS SPECIFICALLY STATED.</strong> We may from time to time, combine Information (as that term is defined below) with other information we collect from other sources, such as information received from Defy, Affiliates, marketing companies or Advertisers and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your use of or participation in the Site or any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity offered through the Site terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the Site or any features, activities or services offered through the Site.</p>

<p><strong>2. United States of America Governing Law.</strong></p>
<p>The Site is designed and targeted to United States of America audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the United States of America We make no representation that this Site is operated in accordance with the laws or regulations of, or governed by, other nations. By participating in our Site activities, you certify that you meet the age and other eligibility requirements for this Site as set forth in our <strong><u>Terms of Use Agreement</u></strong>. If you do not meet such age and other eligibility requirements, please discontinue using the Site immediately as your continued use of the Site indicates that you are agreeing to the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you are located outside of the United States of America, you use this Site at your own risk and initiative and you, not us, are responsible for compliance with any applicable local and national laws. <strong>Please be aware that any Personal Information and Other Information you provide to us or we obtain as a result of your use of this Site will be collected in the United States of America and/or transferred to the United States of America and subject to United States of America law.</strong> By using this Site, participating in any Site activities and/or providing us with your Personal Information and Other Information, you (i) consent to the transfer and/or processing of any Information to and in the United States of America, (ii) acknowledge that United States of America law may provide a lower standard of protection for personal data than the laws of your location (see, for example, European Union Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995, a copy of which can be found <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:HTML">here</a>) and (iii) understand that we will collect, transfer, store, process and/or deal with your Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and United States of America law. Consequently, to the full extent permitted by law, you hereby waive any claims relating to the processing of your Personal Information or Other Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy that may arise under the laws and regulations that apply to you in or of any other country or jurisdiction. This policy and our legal obligations are subject to the laws of the State of New York and the United States of America, regardless of the location of any user. Any claims or complaints must be filed in the United States of America in the State of New York.</p>

<p><strong>3. Collection and Use of Personal Information and Other Information (Other than Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional Opportunities).</strong></p>
<p>When we use the term "Personal Information" we mean information that would allow someone to identify you or contact you, such as your full name, postal address, e-mail address or telephone number.  When we use the term "Other Information", we mean any information other than Personal Information that may be collected about you <strong>(Personal Information and Other Information, together, the "<u>Information</u>"). </strong></p>
<p><strong>a.&nbsp; Information We Collect that You Provide Us.</strong></p>
<ul class="text-list roman bold">
	<li><p><strong>User Registration.</strong> To the extent we offer user registration on the Site, to register as a member of the Site, you are required to select a user name and password (together, your "User ID") and may be required to also provide other Information, such as your email address and date of birth. Additional Information may be requested during the registration process (but not required).</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>In Connection with Certain Features and Functions.</strong> We may also provide you with access to certain features or functions that we may offer on the Site, such as the option to subscribe to a selection of free email newsletters and other periodic information, chat rooms, message boards, electronic mail services, messaging services, auctions, shopping, registration and member profile pages. To sign up for or participate in these features or functions, you may be required to provide us with certain Information about you in order for us to personalize and/or allow you to use such features and functions. For example, to sign up to receive email newsletters, you may be required to provide your email address, date of birth and zip code separate from any user registration. Further, for example, to the extent we offer such services, if you order any of our various Products (as defined in the <strong>Terms of Use Agreement</strong>), in addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect and may maintain your billing address, shipping address, Product selections, your credit card or other payment instrument information, your order number and information about your computer's internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to the Site (e.g., the referring URL). Your credit card or debit card number if collected will be via a secure transmission.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>In Connection with Promotions such as Contests and Sweepstakes.</strong> There may be a separate registration process to enter Promotions such as contests and sweepstakes which may require the submission of all or some of the following: your first and last name, street address, city, state and zip code, email address, telephone number and date of birth. Additional Information may be requested depending on the specific Promotion, but submission of such Information may be optional. The Promotion's entry page and/or Rules will provide the specific requirements. You may also have the opportunity to opt-in to receive special Promotions or offers from our third party advertisers, sponsors or promotional partners ("<u>Advertisers</u>") as a result of your use of the Site in connection with many of these types of Promotions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>b.&nbsp; Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</strong></p>
<p>"Cookies" (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity. "Web beacons" (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. The Site and/or third parties may use "cookies", "web beacons" and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, "Tracking Technologies") to collect Other Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web.</p>
<p>We use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between associated sites without logging into each site, understand Site and internet usage, improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your experience on this Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), understand your interactions with email messages (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), save your password in password-protected areas, save your online game or video player settings, enable you to use shopping carts on the Site, help us offer you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and administer the Site and for other purposes described in the "Use of Information", "Other Information Collected by Us" section below. These Tracking Technologies collect "click stream" data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Site (such as your visits to the Site's webpages, use of our features and purchasing history or preferences), may collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on this Site and other websites offered by Defy and/or Affiliates and may also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the Device you use to access the Site ("Identifier"). An Identifier is automatically assigned to any Device you use to access the Site. Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process but we may associate Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies with Personal Information.</p>
<p>By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site through these Tracking Technologies and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you.</p>
<p>This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, "<u>Third Party Advertising Service Providers</u>") to, for example, serve advertisements on the Site, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site ("<u>Targeting Services</u>"). These Third Party Advertising Service Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Site and other websites you have visited. Targeting Services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.</p>
<p>The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as Advertisers and other third parties, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise collect or have access to Information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Site.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>b.&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Opting-Out of Use of Certain Other Information Collected by Tracking Technologies.</strong></p>
<ol class="text-list roman bold">
	<li><p><strong>Tracking Technologies Set By Third Party Advertising Service Providers and Advertisers.</strong> With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Advertising Service Providers and Advertisers, you have a number of options:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="text-list" style="margin-left:40px;">
	<li><p>Third Party Advertising Service Providers and Advertisers may collect Other Information about you when you visit this Site to help identify products and services that may interest you and deliver advertising tailored to your interests.</p></li>
	<li><p>You can opt-out of the use of Other Information for these advertising purposes by DoubleClick/Google, by using such Third Party Advertising Service Provider’s opt-out tools. You can access DoubleClick's tool at <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/ads/"><strong>http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/ads/</strong></a> or as described in the next bullet point.</p></li>
	<li><p>We also may from time to time permit other Third Party Advertising Service Providers and Advertisers to collect Other Information on the Site. Some of these Third Party Advertising Service Providers and Advertisers may participate in the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp"><strong>Network Advertising Initiative's Opt-Out Tool</strong></a> and/or the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/"><strong>Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising</strong></a>. Please click on the links to these tools to learn more about your choices.</p></li>
	<li><p>Please note the following with respect to opting out:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><strong><u>The opt-out tools discussed above are "cookie based."</u></strong> This means that the tools rely on cookies to remember your choices with respect to the use of your information by the parties that offer you those choices. If you delete Tracking Technologies using the controls in your Web browser (a process described below) after opting out, you may have to opt out again to re-establish your opt-out preferences.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong><u>Opt-outs are "browser-specific."</u></strong> The opt-out preferences that you choose will apply only to the Web browser that you used when you selected these preferences. This means, for example, that if you opt-out while using Internet Explorer 9, this choice will not affect the use of Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same Device. It also means that opting-out on one Device will not affect the use of Other Information by Tracking Technologies on other Devices that you may use to access the Site.</p></li>
			<li><p>You also can prevent the use of certain Tracking Technologies (other than Flash cookies) on a particular Device by using the controls in your Web browser. To do so, you must:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p><u>Delete existing</u> Tracking Technologies through the "Internet Options" sub-option of the "Tools" menu option of your browser or otherwise as directed by your browser's support feature; <u>and</u></p></li>
					<li><p><u>Disable future Tracking Technologies</u> through the same browser controls. Additional information on enabling or disabling most Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser's support feature. </p></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>You can choose to have the Device you use to access the Site warn you each time a cookie or most other Tracking Technologies is being set (other than Flash cookies), or you can choose to turn off such warnings. This is done through your browser on the Device you use to access the Site. Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser's support feature.</p></li>
	<li><p>Opting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Third Party Advertising Service Providers' Tracking Technologies does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads. Opting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Third Party Advertising Service Providers' Tracking Technologies only means that such ads will no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you will continue to see ads on this Site.</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.</strong> Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.</p></li>

<p>We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.

<p><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional Opportunities. </strong></p>
<p>GameTrailers may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from GameTrailers, either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device. Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by Defy and/or Affiliates for GameTrailers. The Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user's telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier's name. Additional Information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information. Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement.</p>
<p>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party's interception of messages or a user's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.</p>
<p>Users that register for GameTrailers' wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from GameTrailers. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. <strong>Under no circumstances will the Site, Defy or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email address. </strong></p>
<ul class="text-list latin bold">
	<li><p><strong>Registration.</strong> To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for GameTrailers' wireless marketing services.  Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the "single opt-in" or the "double-opt-in" (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of GameTrailers depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services will require the "double opt-in" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</p>
		<ul class="text-list roman bold">
			<li><p><strong>Single Opt-in Method:</strong> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The user's voluntary submission of the designated word or code to GameTrailers will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to GameTrailers to send text messages to him or her. GameTrailers will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a "Thank you" message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from GameTrailers or by sending a text message to GameTrailers that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT". </p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method: </strong> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to GameTrailers' sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by GameTrailers) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site's registration page. The user must also agree to the Site's Privacy Policy and <strong><u>Terms of Use Agreement</u></strong> before the online registration process is completed. GameTrailers will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from GameTrailers to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of GameTrailers' wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time <u>provided that</u> GameTrailers may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while GameTrailers continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:</strong> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. GameTrailers will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from GameTrailers to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of GameTrailers' wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time provided that GameTrailers may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while GameTrailers continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p><strong>Termination of Wireless Services by User. </strong> Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from GameTrailers by the following procedure:</p><p>A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by GameTrailers at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT". GameTrailers will terminate the user's registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user. Any of these words followed by the word "ALL" in the user's termination request will cancel all of the user's registered wireless services with GameTrailers. If the user unsubscribes from one or all of GameTrailers service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user's previous opt-in.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Termination of Wireless Services by GameTrailers. </strong> A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that GameTrailers may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice. GameTrailers may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Use of Information. </strong> GameTrailers will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email address, or other Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use. We will not share any Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure. We will share Personal Information with the operational service providers that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you and with Defy and Affiliates.</p></li>
</ul>

			<li><p><strong>Disclosure to Certain Other Third Parties.</strong>  In addition to the above, we will make your Personal Information and Other Information available to certain third parties in the following limited circumstances:</p>
				<ul class="text-list">

					<li><p>If you opt-in or otherwise agree to have your Personal Information shared with or otherwise disclosed to a third party for marketing purposes, in which case the third party's use of your Information is subject to the third party's own privacy policy;</p></li>
					<li><p>If, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate: to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries; to protect our business and assets or the rights, property or safety of the Site, Defy Media, LLC, Defy, the Affiliates, or any of its or their operational service providers, licensors, suppliers, Advertisers, customers, users, or any other party; to limit our legal liability; to defend our interests; to enforce this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use Agreement and/or to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations or requests by law enforcement agencies or governmental authorities and/or</p></li>

		</ul>

	<li><p><strong>Sharing and Disclosure of Other Information.</strong> We may share or otherwise disclose Other Information with third parties, but we do not disclose Personal Information to them except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Reviewing, Updating or Deleting Certain Information.</strong></p>
<p>Generally, you may review, update or delete certain Information collected by the Site by, if you are a registered user of the Site and logged into the Site, by clicking "Profile" or your display name at the top of the Site and then selecting "Edit Profile." However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information. We will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID.</p>
<p>You may also exercise certain privacy settings options by, if you are a registered user of the Site and logged into the Site, clicking "Profile" or your display name at the top of the Site, selecting "Edit Profile" or "Manage Account" and selecting the "Privacy" tab.</p>
<p>Certain Information collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user's request. </p>
<p>If the burden or expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such Information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries</p>
<p><strong><u>Children or Ineligible Teenagers.</u></strong> If we, or Defy or Affiliates, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site ("<u>Ineligible Teenagers</u>"), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child's (or Ineligible Teenager's) parent or legal guardian (the "<u>Parent</u>") always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message. The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18 (or the age of majority in your state). </p>
<p>In addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's membership must use their child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the "Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use" Section of the <strong><u>Terms of Use Agreement</u></strong> to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's member; alternatively, Parents may send an email to the Site's Privacy Administrator and provide us with your child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID and request to terminate your child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user's account and Personal Information by any person without the user's User ID. If a Parent does not have his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID, the Parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the Parent's name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child's or Ineligible Teenager's name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child's or Ineligible Teenager's date of birth. The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. GameTrailers will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. GameTrailers will then terminate the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.</p>

<p><strong>8.&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Protection of Information.</strong></p>
<p>While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Information. However, regardless of our efforts and the Device you use to access the Site, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of the Site. We also limit access to the Site by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality.</p>
<p><strong><u>Phishing</u></strong>. Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' personal identity data and financial account credentials. "Phishers" use 'spoofed' e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and social security numbers. <strong>WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD!</strong> If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site's Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:privacy@gametrailers.com"><strong>privacy@gametrailers.com</strong></a>, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer. </p>

<p><strong>9.&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Your California Privacy Rights.</strong></p>
<p>If you are a resident of the State of California, we provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options such as your right to opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as "unsubscribe") or opt-in for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as Advertisers) for marketing purposes. Therefore, pursuant to the California Civil Code, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.</p>
