 <strong>b. </strong><strong>Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
 We use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between associated sites without logging into each site, understand Site and internet usage, improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your experience on this Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), understand your interactions with email messages (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), save your password in password-protected areas, save your online game or video player settings, enable you to use shopping carts on the Site, help us offer you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and administer the&nbsp;Site&nbsp;and for other purposes described in the "Use of Information", "<strong><u><a href="#link3">Other Information Collected by Us</a></u></strong>" section below.&nbsp; These Tracking Technologies collect "click stream" data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Site (such as your visits to the Site's webpages, use of our features and purchasing history or preferences), may collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on this Site and other websites offered by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates and may also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the Device you use to access the Site ("Identifier").&nbsp; An Identifier is automatically assigned to any Device you use to access the Site.&nbsp; Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process but we may associate Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies with Personal Information. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
 This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, "<u>Third Party Advertising Service Providers</u>") to, for example, serve advertisements on the Site, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site ("<u>Targeting Services</u>").&nbsp; These Third Party Advertising Service Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Site and other websites you have visited.&nbsp; Targeting Services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">

 <strong>5.<a name="link5"></a> Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional Opportunities. </strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 GameTrailers may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from GameTrailers, either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device.&nbsp; Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates for GameTrailers.&nbsp; The Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user's telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier's name.&nbsp; Additional Information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information.&nbsp; Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party's interception of messages or a user's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 Users that register for GameTrailers' wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from GameTrailers.&nbsp; Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise.&nbsp; <strong>Under no circumstances will the Site, </strong><strong>GameTrailers</strong><strong>, its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email address. </strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
 <strong>a. Registration.&nbsp; </strong>To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for GameTrailers' wireless marketing services.&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the "single opt-in" or the "double-opt-in" (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of GameTrailers depending on the type of Promotion.&nbsp; Premium rate services will require the "double opt-in" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
 <strong>i. Single Opt-in Method:</strong>&nbsp; In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted.&nbsp; The user's voluntary submission of the designated word or code to GameTrailers will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to GameTrailers to send text messages to him or her. GameTrailers will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a "Thank you" message.&nbsp; The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from GameTrailers or by sending a text message to GameTrailers that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT".&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 54pt;">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
 <strong>ii. Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:</strong>&nbsp; In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process.&nbsp; The user must affirmatively consent to GameTrailers' sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by GameTrailers) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site's registration page.&nbsp; The user must also agree to the Site's Privacy Policy and <strong><u>Terms of Use Agreement</u></strong> before the online registration process is completed. GameTrailers will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from GameTrailers to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of GameTrailers' wireless marketing service.&nbsp; Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.&nbsp; A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time <u>provided that</u> GameTrailers may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while GameTrailers continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 54pt;">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
 <strong>iii. Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:</strong>&nbsp; In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted.&nbsp; GameTrailers will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from GameTrailers to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of GameTrailers' wireless marketing service.&nbsp; Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.&nbsp; A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time provided that GameTrailers may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while GameTrailers continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 54pt;">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
 <strong>b. Termination of Wireless Services by User.</strong>&nbsp; Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from GameTrailers by the following procedure:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
 A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by GameTrailers at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT".&nbsp; GameTrailers will terminate the user's registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user.&nbsp; Any of these words followed by the word "ALL" in the user's termination request will cancel all of the user's registered wireless services with GameTrailers.&nbsp; If the user unsubscribes from one or all of GameTrailers service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user's previous opt-in.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
 <strong>c.</strong> <strong>Termination of Wireless Services by </strong><strong>GameTrailers.</strong>&nbsp; A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that GameTrailers may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice.&nbsp; GameTrailers may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
 <strong>d. Use of Information.&nbsp; </strong>GameTrailers will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email address, or other Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use.&nbsp; We will not share any Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure.&nbsp; We will share Personal Information with the operational service providers that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you and with the Parent Companies and Affiliates.</p>
