      <div class="para">Mindspark Interactive Network, Inc.

      <div class="para"><b>PLEASE NOTE: Zwinky.com and related applications and services are governed by a separate privacy policy available <a href="http://info.zwinky.com/zwinkyinfo/privacy.jhtml">here</a>. IWON.com and related applications and services are governed by a separate privacy policy available <a href="http://www.iwon.com/home/modules/pages/support/privacypolicy.jhtml">here</a>.</b> Other MINDSPARK websites, services and applications that are not a part of the FWP Products are governed by independent terms of services and privacy policies.</div>

      <div class="para">We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using any of our FWP Products or transacting business with us. By using any of our FWP Products, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Mindspark Interactive Network, Inc. is a part of the IAC family of businesses (<a href="http://www.iac.com/">www.iac.com</a>), which includes Ask.com, iWon.com, Girlsense.com, Life123.com, Citysearch, Vimeo.com, Evite, Match.com, ServiceMagic, Gifts.com, Pronto, Shoebuy, College Humor, and many others.

      <h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h3>
      
      <div class="para"><u>In General</u>. We may collect personal information that can identify you, such as your name and email address, and other information that does not identify you. When you provide personal information through any of the FWP Products, the information may be sent to servers located in the United States and other countries around the world.</div>
      
	  <ul>
		<li><b>Information you provide.</b> We may collect and store any personal information you enter on or via the FWP Products or provide to us in some other manner, including personal information that may be contained in any video, comment or other submission you upload or post to any FWP Product. This includes identifying information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender and age, and other demographic information. </li>
		<li><b>Information from other sources.</b> We may also periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from other IAC businesses, business partners, social networks, contractors and other third parties and add it to our account information or other information we have collected. Examples of information that we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, purchase history, and additional demographic information.
			<ul>
				<li>Note about Social Networks.  If you choose to login to an FWP Product via a social networking site, you are granting Mindspark permission to access and use general information about you, as provided by the social network, for purposes of establishing a unique FWP Product account for you. For example, if you use Facebook Connect® to login to a Webfetti application, per Facebook policies, Facebook may provide Mindspark access to your and your friends' names, profile pictures, gender, user IDs, connections, and any content shared using the "Everyone" privacy setting.  Facebook may also make information about the location of your computer or access device and your age available to applications and websites in order to help them implement appropriate security measures and control the distribution of age-appropriate content.  We strongly recommend that you review the policies of any social networks you use to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in which they use information you share with them.</li>
			</ul>
		</li> 
		<li><b>Information about others.</b> We may also collect and store personal information about other people that you provide to us. If you use any FWP Product to send others (friends, relatives, colleagues, etc.) a product such as a gift, information that may interest them or messages (such as invitations) through our system, we may store your personal information, and the personal information of each such recipient. If you use any FWP Product to store other people's contact information or event info (such as birthdays, anniversaries, etc.), we will store such information until you delete it. Similarly, if you use any FWP Product to upload, share and/or distribute content (including videos, comments or other submissions), and such content contains personal information about others, such information may be stored in order to allow for such uploading, sharing and/or distribution.<br><br>
			<b>PLEASE NOTE:</b><br><br>
			<u>When sending a MyFunCards ecard</u> you will be given the option to have the recipient's email address included in your address book and, if such option is selected, their address will be stored until you delete the entry from your address book. Whether you select the option to store the recipient's email address or not, the recipient's information is stored for the time necessary to process and/or deliver the ecard, and may also be stored for a limited amount of time in your "sent cards" history.<br><br>
			<u>When using the MyFunCards calendar functionality as a MyFunCards registered user</u>, you will be able to (i) include reminders of your friends', family members' and colleagues' birthdays, anniversaries or other events; or (ii) send a request to friends, family members or colleagues to add birthday or other event information to your account's calendar. If you decide to utilize this functionality or if your friends, family members or colleagues fulfill your request, the relevant information will be stored until you delete the entry from your calendar.<br><br>
			When using the MyFunCards calendar functionality as a recipient of a request from a MyFunCards user, you will be able to add your birthday or other event information to the MyFunCards user's calendar. If you fulfill the request, the relevant information will be stored until the MyFunCards user deletes the event information from their calendar and/or your contact information from their address book.<br><br>
			<u>When using our "tell-a-friend" referral functionality</u>, the recipient's information is not stored for longer than necessary to process and deliver the tell-a-friend notification.<br><br>
			<u>When using Smiley Creator to post Smileys</u> to your social networking page(s), the social networking page access information is not stored longer than necessary to process and deliver the Smiley, as requested by the user.

      <div class="para">Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy.

These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.</div>
      
      <div class="para"><u>Aggregated and non-personal information</u>. We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and our IAC sister companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties.

We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our FWP Product websites and the most popular features or services accessed.

      <div class="para"><b>We do not screen, filter or monitor user submissions to the FWP Product websites, nor do we scrape or glean personal information from any such submissions; however, to the extent that any video, comment or other user submission contains personal information (whether name, likeness, address, telephone number or otherwise, and whether such information pertains to the submitter or someone else), such personal information may be viewed by other users of the website.</b> See "<a href="#usersubmissions">USER SUBMISSIONS</a>", below.</div>
      
      <h3>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</h3>
      
      <div class="para">There are a number of places on or via the FWP Products where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement, social network link, or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</div>
      
      <h3>HOW YOU CAN ACCESS YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
      
      <div class="para">If you have registered for any FWP Product and have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account via the relevant FWP Product's log-in page. You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us. More information about how to contact us is provided below. If you have an online account with us, you also may choose to close your account at any time by contacting customer support at: <a href="mailto:customerservice@help.smileycentral.com">customerservice@help.smileycentral.com</a>. After you close your account, you will not be able to sign in to our website or access any of your personal information. However, you can open a new account at any time. If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our website or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.</div>
      
      <h3>UNIFIED REGISTRATION</h3>
      
      <div class="para">As a service to our users, we may consolidate registration data for one or more of the FWP Products, and/or for one or more of the FWP Products and certain other specified websites, services or applications offered by MINDSPARK or its affiliated companies, so that users are only required to provide registration information once, and would then be able to use the same unique ID and password to access all such websites, services or applications. Accordingly, if you close your online account related to one of the FWP Products, such closure may affect your ability to sign in to or otherwise use another FWP Product.</div>
      
      <h3><a name="yourinfo">YOUR CHOICES ABOUT COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</a></h3>
      
      <ul>
      	<li>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of one or more FWP Product because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; access certain assets or areas; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our FWP Product websites.</li>
      	<li>
      		When you register on a FWP Product website, you may be given a choice as to whether you want to receive email messages and/or newsletters about product updates, improvements, special offers, or containing special distributions of content by us.

You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial email that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future for the FWP Product for which the commercial e-mail was sent. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship email communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.<br><br>
      		Please note that, changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as a credit card processing partner or an event provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.
      	</li>
      	<li>You may tell us not to share your personal information with third parties or the IAC family of companies for direct marketing purposes by clicking on the following link and entering the email address associated with your account: <a href="http://www.mailunsubscribe.com/optout.jsp?pid=FWP001" rel="nofollow">click here</a>.</li>

      <h3>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
      
      <div class="para">We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.<br>
      We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.

      <h3><a name="usersubmissions">USER SUBMISSIONS</a></h3>
      
      <div class="para">We may provide areas on the FWP Product websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others; upload content (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.); and post comments or reviews of content found on the Website. Such postings are governed by the FunWebProducts EULA (available by clicking <a href="http://helpint.mywebsearch.com/intlinfo/eula/eula.jhtml">here</a>) or any terms and conditions of use, terms of service or similarly identified terms made available at the relevant FWP Product's website. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Once you have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information.</div>

They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party's privacy policy.

      <div class="para indented">Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.<br>
		Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may include web beacons in promotional [or other] e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.
