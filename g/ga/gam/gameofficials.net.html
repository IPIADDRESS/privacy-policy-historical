				&nbsp; (Updated February 4, 2018)

				<p>At GameOfficials.net we recognize that privacy is important. This Policy applies
				to all of the products, services and websites offered by
				GameOfficials.net or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies (collectively, GameOfficials.net's
				"services"). In addition, where more detailed information is needed to explain
				our privacy practices, we will post separate privacy notices to describe how
				particular services process <a href="/public/privacyFAQ.cfm#personalinfo">personal
				information</a>.</p>

				<p>If you have any questions about this Policy, please feel free to <a href="/public/contact.cfm">contact us</a> through our website or write
				to us at Privacy Concerns, c/o SPay, Inc., 5360 Legacy Drive, Suite 150, Plano, TX 75024.</p>

				<p><a name="information"></a><b><u>Information we collect and how we use
				it:</u></b>
				<br>We may offer services that do not require you to register for
				an account or provide any personal information to us. In
				order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types
				of information:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><b>Information you provide</b> - When you sign up for a <a href="/public/privacyFAQ.cfm#account">GameOfficials.net Account</a> or other GameOfficials.net service or
				promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such
				as your name, email address and an account password). For certain services,
				we also request credit card or other payment
				account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We
				may combine the information you submit under your account with information from
				other GameOfficials.net services or third parties in order to provide you with a better
				experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we
				may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information. <br><br>
				</li><li><b>GameOfficials.net cookies</b> - When you visit a GameOfficials.net website, we send one or more cookies -
				a small file containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely
				identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by
				storing user preferences and tracking user trends.
				Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your
				browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
				However, some GameOfficials.net features and services may not function properly
				if your cookies are disabled. <br><br>
				</li><li><b>Log information</b> - When you use GameOfficials.net services, our servers
				automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a
				website. These <a href="/public/privacyFAQ.cfm#serverlogs">server logs</a> may include
				information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type,
				browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that
				may uniquely identify your browser. <br><br>
				</li><li><b>User communications</b> - When you send email or other communication to
				GameOfficials.net, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries,
				respond to your requests and improve our services. <br><br>
				</li><li><b>Affiliated sites</b> - We may offer some services in connection with
				other web sites. However, <b>no personal information will be sent to any
				third party (outside of the GameOfficials.net family of products) without your
				explicit consent.</b> We process such information in
				accordance with this Policy. Any affiliated sites may have different privacy
				practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies. <br><br>
				</li><li><b>Links</b> - GameOfficials.net may present links in a format that enables
				us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to
				improve the quality of our technology, customized content and
				advertising. For more information about links and redirected URLs, please see
				our <a href="/public/privacyFAQ.cfm#urls">FAQs</a>. <br><br>
				</li><li><b>Other sites</b> - This Privacy Policy applies to web sites and services
				that are owned and operated by GameOfficials.net. We do not exercise control over sites
				that may be displayed as links from within our various pages. These
				other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect
				data or solicit personal information from you.</li></ul>

				<p>GameOfficials.net only processes personal information for the purposes described
				in the applicable Privacy Policy and/or privacy notice for specific services. In
				addition to the above, such purposes include:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Providing our products and services to users, including the display of
				customized content;
				</li><li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve
				our services;
				</li><li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and
				</li><li>Developing new services.</li></ul>

				<p>You can find more information about how we process personal
				information by referring to the privacy notices for particular services. </p>

				<p>GameOfficials.net processes personal information on our servers in the United
				States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we may process personal
				information on a server outside your own country. We process personal
				information to provide our own services. We will not process personal
				information on behalf of a third party, such as our advertising partners.</p>

				<p></p>

				<p><a name="infochoices"></a><b><u>Choices for personal information</u></b>
				<br>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration,
				we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a
				manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask
				for your consent prior to such use. </p>

				<p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than
				those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will
				offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for
				those other purposes. We will not collect or use <a href="/public/privacyFAQ.cfm#sensitiveinfo">sensitive information</a> for purposes
				other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service
				notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. </p>

				<p>You can decline to submit personal information to any of our
				services, in which case GameOfficials.net may not be able to provide those services to you.
				</p>

				<p><a name="infosharing"></a><b><u>Information sharing</u></b>
				<br>GameOfficials.net only shares personal information with other companies or
				individuals outside of GameOfficials.net in the following limited circumstances: </p>
				<ul>
				<li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any
				sensitive personal information.

				</li><li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of
				such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law,
				regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce
				applicable <a href="/public/termsOfService.cfm">Terms of Service</a>, including
				investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise
				address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent
				harm to the rights, property or safety of GameOfficials.net, its users or the public as
				required or permitted by law.</li></ul>

				<p>If GameOfficials.net becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of
				sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal
				information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
				</p>

				<p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of <a href="/public/privacyFAQ.cfm#aggregatedinfo">aggregated, non-personal information</a>,
				such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or
				how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not
				identify you individually. </p>

				<p>Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions
				about the management or use of personal data. </p>

				<p><a name="infosecurity"></a><b><u>Information security</u></b>
				<br>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized
				access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These
				include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing
				practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard
				against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. </p>

				<p>We restrict access to personal information to GameOfficials.net employees,
				contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate,
				develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality
				obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal
				prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. </p>

				<p><a name="dataintegrity"></a><b><u>Data integrity</u></b>
				<br>GameOfficials.net processes personal information only for the purposes for which
				it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable
				service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and
				processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the
				personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take
				reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate,
				complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their
				personal information whenever necessary. </p>

				<p><a name="access"></a><b><u>Accessing and updating personal information</u></b>
				<br>When you use GameOfficials.net services, we make good faith efforts to provide
				you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if
				it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise
				required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask
				individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be
				accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may
				decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic,
				require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or
				would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information
				residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any
				case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service
				free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some
				of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users'
				personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the
				specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services. </p>

				<p><a name="enforcement"></a><b><u>Enforcement</u></b>
				<br>GameOfficials.net regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy. Please feel
				free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or GameOfficials.net's
				treatment of personal information by <a href="/public/contact.cfm">contacting
				us</a> through this web site or by writing to us at Privacy Concerns, c/o GameOfficials.net, 5360 Legacy Drive, Suite 150, Plano, TX 75024. When we
				receive formal written complaints at this address, it is GameOfficials.net's policy to
				contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate
				with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection
				authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data
				that cannot be resolved between GameOfficials.net and an individual. </p>

				<p><a name="policychanges"></a><b><u>Changes to this policy</u></b>
				<br>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We
				will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and
				we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy
				changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more
				prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy
				changes). Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page
				by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy
				in an archive for your review. </p>

				<p>If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Policy,
				please feel free to contact us any time through this web site or at
				Privacy Concerns, c/o GameOfficials.net, 5360 Legacy Drive, Suite 150, Plano, TX 75024.</p></td>
