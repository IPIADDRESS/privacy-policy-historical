          GR has periodic contests giving away video and computer game oriented 
          prizes. The demographic data collected by this contest for internal 
          use only. It is used to assess our audience and to assist in the sale 
          of advertising.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>IP Address<br>
          </b>Your IP address is a number that is assigned by your ISP to your 
          computer to identify it on the internet. GR uses your IP address to 
          determine total site traffic, help diagnose problems with our server, 
          and to administer our website. We also sometimes use IP addresses to 
          contact users and occasionally ban those users who are not complying 
          with our <a href="terms.htm">Terms of Use</a>. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Public Forums</b><br>
          This site provides chat rooms, forums, message boards, and email discussion 
          groups to its users. Use of these boards, and the entire site, is governed 
          by GR's <a href="terms.htm">Terms of Use</a>. Data collected from the 
          bulletin boards is used for verification purposes only and is not used 
          in any other way. Please remember that any information that is disclosed 
          in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution 
          when deciding to disclose your personal information.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Other sites 
          </b><br>
          GR contains links to other websites. We cannot be responsible for their 
          content or for private information that they collect. Please note: Information 
          you release directly to parties who provide services to Game Revolution, 
          such as any services or vendors in the <a href="http://www.game-revolution.com/store/buy.htm">SmartShop</a> 
          or other sites you encounter on the Internet (even sites that are co-branded 
          with Game Revolution) may be subject to different rules of use or disclosure. 
          We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing 
          personal information to third parties. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Protection</b><br>
          Game Revolution uses industry standard protections, such as firewalls, 
          to make sure that your data remains confidential. While we will not 
          disclose all our security measures, they may also include machine gun 
          towers, zombies, a moat, Lee Majors, pungee stakes, vicious guard monkeys, 
          and a surly elf who will not relinquish the blue key. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>No Warrantee</b><br>
          Nobody is perfect. We cannot completely ensure that your private communications 
          and other personal information will not be disclosed to others. By way 
          of example, without limiting the foregoing, under certain circumstances 
          we may be forced to disclose information to the government, or hackers 
          may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, 
          or we might disclose your information to other parties as part of providing 
          additional services to you. Plus, our wives and girlfriends are extremely 
          nosy. Therefore, although we try, we can not promise that your personal 
          information or private communications will remain entirely private.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>COPPA Compliance</b><br>
          Game Revolution is not subject to the terms of COPPA because the site 
          is not targeted at children under 13. Parts of the site contain depictions 
          of violence, references to the consumption of alcohol and drugs, Taoist 
          philosophy, nude video game characters, strong language, and the Spice 
          Girls. The Game Revolution website is restricted by both Cyberpatrol 
          and AOL Parental Controls. We urge concerned parents to get involved 
          in their children's online experiences, rather than using those flawed 
          tools as a crutch. <br>
          <br>
          Game Revolution is committed to protecting the privacy of children online. 
          Children should not reveal their addresses, phone numbers or any other 
          personal information to strangers on the Internet. Children under the 
          age of 13 are prohibited from supplying Game Revolution with any personal 
          information, through the above services or by any means, without first 
          providing parental consent. This consent, in the form of a signed letter, 
          must be submitted by mail to Game Revolution, 740 Gilman St., Berkeley, 
          CA 94710.</font></p>
