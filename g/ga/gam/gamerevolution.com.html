We use third-party advertising companies to serve our ads on the Internet. These 
third-party advertising companies employ cookie and 1x1 pixel .gif technology

companies may use anonymous information about your visits to our Web site and

you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from setting and/or reading cookies

and opt out or visit the NAI gateway opt-out site to opt-out of all network advertising

<p>We use MaxOnline and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

<p><b>Newsletter</b><br> 
  The subscribers 
of the GR weekly newsletter, <a href="http://www.game-revolution.com/chatter/newsletter/newsletter.htm">Spam 
Revolution</a>, are kept as a list of email addresses only. No other information 
is tied to or contained in this list and we have no idea who these maniacs are. 
Occasionally, third parties may send special offers or advertisements to newsletter 
subscribers, but not very often. The list is confidentially maintained by <a href="http://www.freshaddress.com">freshaddress.com</a>. 
Opting in and out of all mailings can be done through the <a href="http://www.freshaddress.com">freshaddress.com</a> 
website. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Contest</b><br> 
GR has periodic contests giving away video and computer game oriented prizes. 
The demographic data collected by this contest for internal use only. It is used 
to assess our audience and to assist in the sale of advertising.</p><p align="left"><b>IP 
Address<br> 
</b>Your IP address is a number that is assigned by your ISP to your 
computer to identify it on the internet. GR uses your IP address to determine 
total site traffic, help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer 
our website. We also sometimes use IP addresses to contact users and occasionally 
ban those users who are not complying with our <a href="terms.htm">Terms of Use</a>. 
</p><p align="left"><b>Public 
Forums</b><br> 
This site provides chat rooms, forums, message boards, and email 
discussion groups to its users. Use of these boards, and the entire site, is governed 
by GR's <a href="terms.htm">Terms of Use</a>. Data collected from the bulletin 
boards is used for verification purposes only and is not used in any other way. 
Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes 
public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your 
personal information.</p><p align="left"><b>Other 
sites </b><br> 
GR contains links to other websites. We cannot be responsible for 
their content or for private information that they collect. Please note: Information 
you release directly to parties who provide services to Game Revolution, such 
as any services or vendors in the <a href="http://www.game-revolution.com/store/buy.htm">SmartShop</a> 
or other sites you encounter on the Internet (even sites that are co-branded with 
Game Revolution) may be subject to different rules of use or disclosure. We encourage 
you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing personal information to 
third parties. </p><p align="left"><b>Protection</b><br> 
Game Revolution uses industry standard protections, such as firewalls, to make 
sure that your data remains confidential. While we will not disclose all our security 
measures, they may also include machine gun towers, zombies, a moat, Lee Majors, 
pungee stakes, vicious guard monkeys, and a surly elf who will not relinquish 
the blue key. </p><p align="left"><b>No 
Warrantee</b><br> 
Nobody is perfect. We cannot completely ensure that your private 
communications and other personal information will not be disclosed to others. 
By way of example, without limiting the foregoing, under certain circumstances 
we may be forced to disclose information to the government, or hackers may unlawfully 
intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or we might disclose 
your information to other parties as part of providing additional services to 
you. Plus, our wives and girlfriends are extremely nosy. Therefore, although we 
try, we can not promise that your personal information or private communications 
will remain entirely private.</p><p align="left"><b>COPPA 
Compliance</b><br> 
Game Revolution is not subject to the terms of COPPA because 
the site is not targeted at children under 13. Parts of the site contain depictions 
of violence, references to the consumption of alcohol and drugs, Taoist philosophy, 
nude video game characters, strong language, and the Spice Girls. The Game Revolution 
website is restricted by both Cyberpatrol and AOL Parental Controls. We urge concerned 
parents to get involved in their children's online experiences, rather than using 
those flawed tools as a crutch. <br> 
<br> 
Game Revolution is committed to protecting 
the privacy of children online. Children should not reveal their addresses, phone 
numbers or any other personal information to strangers on the Internet. Children 
under the age of 13 are prohibited from supplying Game Revolution with any personal 
information, through the above services or by any means, without first providing 
parental consent. This consent, in the form of a signed letter, must be submitted 
by mail to Game Revolution, 740 Gilman St., Berkeley, CA 94710.</p><p align="left"><b>Third 
Party Advertising Part Deux</b><br>

companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information
