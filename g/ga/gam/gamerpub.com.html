</p>
<p>

This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. We may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.
</p>

<h2>Legal Issues</h2>
<p>
Although we will always strive to guard your identity, we may disclose your personally identifiable information without your permission in limited circumstances.  We will only do so if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with laws, regulations, or government requests or (2) to investigate or protect against harmful activities to our guests, visitors, associates, or property (including the Website), or to others.  If we are required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide your personally identifiable information, we will only do so upon receipt of appropriate documentation.  We may also disclose your information to investigate violation of and enforce our Terms of Use.  Please know that we do not take this responsibility lightly.  Your privacy is of paramount importance to us.
</p>

<p>
You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the Website.  However, as previously discussed, withholding certain requested information may prevent us from providing you with certain services.

<p>
You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from GamesPub or from having your personally identifiable information shared with selected companies. If you wish to opt out, you can do so by editing your account preferences with respect to e-mail or the sharing of information or contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@gamerpub.com">privacy@gamerpub.com</a>. If you elect to “opt out” we will not share your personal information with third parties or send you regular emails.  However, we may continue to use your personal information for internal purposes, such as to enhance your user experience or as necessary to administer the Website or comply with applicable laws and regulations.
</p>
<p>
We may send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent “service alert” messages to you to inform you of specific changes that may impact your ability to use a service you have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status.  Also, we may contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of any applicable licensing, warranty and purchase agreements. 
</p>
<p>
We retain these rights because in limited cases we may need to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters important to you.

</p>
<p>
If you create a personal account with us, based on your personal preferences we may periodically contact you via e-mail to provide information about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you.  These communications will relate to select, reputable third parties with whom we have a strategic marketing relationship.  We may use a third party e-mail service provider to send e-mails. This service provider is prohibited from using your e-mail address for any purpose other than to send GamesPub related e-mail.  If you do not wish to receive e-mails with updates and information please unsubscribe by sending email to: <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@gamerpub.com">unsubscribe@gamerpub.com</a>.  In addition, every time you receive an e-mail you will be provided the choice to opt-out of future e-mails by following the instructions provided in the e-mail.

<h2>Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
<p>
Our website uses “cookie” and “web beacon” technology.  “Cookies” are short pieces of data generated by a web server that a website stores on a user’s computer.  Certain pages on our Website may require the use of a cookie for purposes of keeping information you enter on multiple pages together.  Cookies also enable us to customize our Website and offerings to your needs and provide you with a better online experience with us.  In addition, cookies are used to: 
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>measure usage of various pages on our Website to help us make our information; more pertinent to your needs and easy for you to access; </li>
<li>identify and categorized the internet webpages from which the visitor came to the Website and observe the browsing patterns; and </li>
<li>provide functionality such as online orders, our services and other functionality that we believe would be of interest and value to you. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
The types of cookies that we use are referred to as “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies.  Session cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted once you leave the Website.  Persistent cookies remain on your computer hard drive until you delete them.  We do not use cookies to gather information concerning your visits to other websites, nor ascertain any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with GamesPub.  Cookies do not, under ordinary circumstances, corrupt or damage your computer, programs, or computer files.

</p>
<p>
Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to help website operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. These web beacons are not tied to personally identifiable information. The use of a web beacons allows the site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the web beacon. It makes it easier to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited at a website.  We use the information provided by web beacons to develop a better understanding of how the Website’s visitors use the Website, and to facilitate those visitors' interactions with the Website.
