    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="general-content">
    
      <h2>Version 10/01/2009</h2>
        <p>Here at VGChartz we pride ourselves on user service, and part of that is   looking after your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of   personal information we gather when you visit our site.<br>
        <br>
        The following principles apply to the personally identifying information   we ask for and that you provide. "Personally identifying information"   is information that individually identifies you, such as your name,   physical address or email address<br>
        <br>
        </p>
      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>On some pages of VGChartz a cookie is sent to your computer that   uniquely identifies the user when they log in. A "cookie" is a small   file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer   when you visit a website. Most browsers are initially set up to accept   cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate   when a cookie is being sent. However, some features may not function   properly without cookies.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <h2>Data collection</h2>
      <p>VGChartz collects limited non-personally identifying information your   browser makes available whenever you visit a website. This log   information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type,   browser language, the date and time of your visit and one or more   cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We use this information   to operate, develop and improve our services.<br>
        <br>
        Most of our services require you to register for an account. VGChartz   asks you for some personal information in order to create an account   (name, email address and a password for your account) and we will use   that information to provide the service. The rest of the information you   may wish to provide in your profile is used only by other viewers to   the site, and you can be selective as to which information you enter.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <h2>Information sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not rent or sell your personally identifying information to other   companies or individuals.<br>
        <br>
        If you have an account, we may share the information submitted among the   other services in VGChartz in order to provide you with the best   experience possible.<br>
        <br>
        We may share aggregated information with others. Examples of this   include the number of users who have visited a certain page.<br>
        <br>
        VGChartz uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you   visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including   your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits   to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about   goods and services of interest to you.

      <h2>Information security</h2>
      <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized   access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.<br>
