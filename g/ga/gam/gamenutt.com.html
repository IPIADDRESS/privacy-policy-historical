(See “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</span>” below). The second kind of information is the kind of non-personally identifiable information (“NPII”) collected and stored automatically by many websites. It includes, for example, information about your Internet service provider, operating system, type of browser, geographic location, and pages viewed on Gamenutt. Although this information is related to you, it is not associated with your PII and cannot be linked to you personally.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not want your Information to continue to be collected and used as provided in this Privacy Policy, you should not access or use this Site again.</strong></p>
<p>Game players have access to the Games at no charge in exchange for their agreement to install the software (the “Software”) on their computers or other computing device.

<ul>
<li>When you communicate with us      via the <em>email</em>,      on Gamenutt in      order to request more information regarding our services, or support.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>
<strong>If you do not want us to collect your PII as described above or to use and share your PII as described further below in this Policy, you should NOT provide it to us through any of the Gamenutt features described above. By providing us with your PII using any of these features, you are authorizing our use and sharing of your PII as described in this Policy and any subsequent revisions to this Policy that we may publish on the Site.</strong></strong></p>

<a href="mailto:support@gamenutt.com" target="_blank">Gamenutt Support</a>.</p>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>

<strong>We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under 13 years of age.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Framing/Masking</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some of our pages utilize framing techniques to serve content to from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our site. Please be aware that you are providing your personal information to these third parties.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Use and Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.&nbsp; We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
<p>Sweet Gamer LLC reserves the right to use PII: (1) for the specific purpose for which such information was provided as stated above; (2) for the purposes disclosed at the time such information is provided; or (3) as disclosed in this Policy.</p>
<p>In addition, if Sweet Gamer LLC goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your PII will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified by a prominent notice on the Gamenutt home pages for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your PII.</p>
<p>Sweet Gamer LLC reserves the right to disclose PII as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.</p>
<p><strong><br>
<strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></strong></p>
<p>As with many websites, when you visit Gamenutt, Gamenutt automatically gather certain NPII based on your computer information and stores it in log files. This type of technical and statistical information is used to customize your experience at Gamenutt, to help us improve the quality of Gamenutt and to make your visits to Gamenutt easy, convenient and fun. Gamenutt also collect your IP (Internet protocol) address to help diagnose problems with the site server and for Site administration purposes.</p>
<p>Finally, we and some of our Third Party Advertisers as well as third party ad servers also use cookies, web beacons, clear GIFs, and other monitoring technologies to gather anonymous information. The most common of these technologies are described in more detail below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies</span>. Cookies are small data files that the Gamenutt server places on an individual’s computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site and the Company. We do not tie any PII to the cookies that we set. Cookies also enable us, or our Third Party Advertisers, to use anonymous behavioral profiles and demographic inferences to increase the relevance of online ads that Premium Members receive. Some Gamenutt ads include “web beacons” and some of our Third Party Advertisers may include web beacons on some of their web pages at our request. These web beacons allow us to access the cookies we set and provide ad campaign analysis. While some Web browsers allow a User to automatically reject all cookies or be notified when a cookie is about to be placed on the User’s computer, disabling this feature may compromise the efficiency and added services that our cookies provide. If you ever uninstall the Software, no Sweet Gamer LLC cookies or tracking assets will remain. <strong>. The use of cookies by Third Party Advertisers or ad servers is not subject to this Policy, but is subject to those third parties’ respective privacy policies. If you have a question about such third parties’ privacy policies, you will have to go to their websites for more information and/or contact them directly</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clear GIFs</span>. We employ or our third party business partners may employ a common technology known as a “Clear GIF” or “1-by-1 Pixel” on the Site and in e-mail communications with Users. A Clear GIF, or “graphic interface format” is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1×1 pixel) that is placed on the Site or in an e-mail. The GIFs do not contain any PII but they, provide us with important information about how Users use Gamenutt and respond to e-mail messages. With this information, Gamenutt or our Business Partners are better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative presentations. We may also allow our Third Party Advertisers the ability to use GIFs on the Site solely to track Premium Users who link from the Third Party Advertisers’ respective sites to Gamenutt.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flash LSOs</span></p>
<p>On some of our sites our third party gaming partners use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to provide games and participate in tournaments.</p>
<p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.&nbsp; Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.&nbsp; To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here:</p>

<p><strong>Use and Sharing of Non-Personally Identifiable Information (NPII)</strong></p>
<p>Sweet Gamer LLC shares NPII with our Business Partners in order to customize the services they and Gamenutt provide to you. And of course, we may also disclose any of the NPII collected through Gamenutt or the Software in order to (1) comply with applicable laws, (2) respond to governmental inquiries, (3) comply with valid legal process, or (4) protect our rights and property or that of or our Users.</p>
