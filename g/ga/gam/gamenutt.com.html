		<div class="pagetext"><p><strong>Updated: </strong>February 23, 2011</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains what information Sweet Gamer, LLC (the “Company” or “we”) collects from individuals who visit the gamenutt.com website (the “Site” or “GameNutt”) and/or participate in the resources offered by GameNutt (“User(s)” or “you”). This Policy also explains how the Company uses and maintains that information.</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first email <a href="mailto:support@gamenutt.com">GameNutt Support</a></p>
<p><strong>Changes in this Privacy Statement</strong></p>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy policy, the GameNutt home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on the GameNutt home page.</p>
<p><strong><br>
This Policy applies only to Information collected on Gamenutt and not to information collected or obtained from other sources. </strong></p>
<p>We collect two kinds of information (“Information”) through the Site. The first kind is information that can identify you as a specific individual – such as your name and email address (“PII”). <strong>We do not collect PII</strong>. (See “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</span>” below). The second kind of information is the kind of non-personally identifiable information (“NPII”) collected and stored automatically by many websites. It includes, for example, information about your Internet service provider, operating system, type of browser, geographic location, and pages viewed on GameNutt. Although this information is related to you, it is not associated with your PII and cannot be linked to you personally. If you register to play Premium Games, the NPII collected may also include your internet protocol and HTML information about the content of web pages you visit.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not want your Information to continue to be collected and used as provided in this Privacy Policy, you should not access or use this Site again.</strong></p>
<p>Games are offered free of charge at the Site in exchange for your agreement to complete a “TRANSACTION” that will be pre-defined and disclosed to you before the time of game play. This transaction may include one of many options including registering, installing a toolbar (“the software”), purchasing product(s), or purchasing a membership. You are not obligated to complete any transaction and may abandon at any time.</p>
<p><strong><br>
Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>PII is collected by Gamenutt by using one of the following Site features:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you communicate with us via the <em>email or      registration</em>, on GameNutt.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>
If you do not want us to collect your PII as described above or to use and share your PII as described further below in this Policy, you should NOT provide it to us through any of the GameNutt features described above. By providing us with your PII using any of these features, you are authorizing our use and sharing of your PII as described in this Policy and any subsequent revisions to this Policy that we may publish on the Site.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br>
Updating Your Personally Identifiable Information.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, or remove it by emailing our Customer Support at<br>
<a href="mailto:support@gamenutt.com">Gamenutt Support</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
<p>GameNutt and the content available or emails delivered in connection with GameNutt, are neither intended for, nor directed to, nor to be accessed by, persons under the age of 13.<br>
<strong>We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under 13 years of age.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Use and Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>Sweet Gamer LLC reserves the right to use PII: (1) for the specific purpose for which such information was provided as stated above; (2) for the purposes disclosed at the time such information is provided; or (3) as disclosed in this Policy.</p>
<p>In addition, if Sweet Gamer LLC goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your PII will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified by a prominent notice on the GameNutt home page for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your PII.</p>
<p>Sweet Gamer LLC reserves the right to disclose PII as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.</p>
<p><strong><br>
Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>As with many websites, when you visit GameNutt, GameNutt automatically gathers certain NPII based on your computer information and stores it in log files. This type of technical and statistical information is used to customize your experience at GameNutt, to help us improve the quality of GameNutt and to make your visits to GameNutt easy, convenient and fun. GameNutt also collects your IP (Internet protocol) address to help diagnose problems with the site server and for Site administration purposes.</p>
<p>Finally, we and some of our Third Party Advertisers as well as third party ad servers also use cookies, web beacons, clear GIFs, and other monitoring technologies to gather anonymous information. The most common of these technologies are described in more detail below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies</span>. Cookies are small data files that the GameNutt server places on an individual’s computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site and the Company. We do not tie any PII to the cookies that we set. Cookies also enable us, or our Third Party Advertisers, to use anonymous behavioral profiles and demographic inferences to increase the relevance of online ads. Some GameNutt ads include “web beacons” and some of our Third Party Advertisers may include web beacons on some of their web pages at our request. These web beacons allow us to access the cookies we set and provide ad campaign analysis. While some Web browsers allow a User to automatically reject all cookies or be notified when a cookie is about to be placed on the User’s computer, disabling this feature may compromise the efficiency and added services that our cookies provide. If you ever uninstall the Software, no Sweet Gamer LLC cookies or tracking assets will remain. <strong>. The use of cookies by Third Party Advertisers or ad servers is not subject to this Policy, but is subject to those third parties’ respective privacy policies. If you have a question about such third parties’ privacy policies, you will have to go to their websites for more information and/or contact them directly</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clear GIFs</span>. We employ or our third party business partners may employ a common technology known as a “Clear GIF” or “1-by-1 Pixel” on the Site and in e-mail communications with Users. A Clear GIF, or “graphic interface format” is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1×1 pixel) that is placed on the Site or in an e-mail. The GIFs do not contain any PII but they, provide us with important information about how Users use GameNutt and respond to e-mail messages. With this information, GameNutt or our Business Partners are better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative presentations. We may also allow our Third Party Advertisers the ability to use GIFs on the Site solely to track Users who link from the Third Party Advertisers’ respective sites to GameNutt, but this ability to track does not allow the Third Party Advertisers access to Premium User PII.</p>
<p><strong>Use and Sharing of Non-Personally Identifiable Information (NPII)</strong></p>
<p>Sweet Gamer LLC shares NPII with our Business Partners in order to customize the services they and GameNutt provide to you. And of course, we may also disclose any of the NPII collected through GameNutt or the Software in order to (1) comply with applicable laws, (2) respond to governmental inquiries, (3) comply with valid legal process, or (4) protect our rights and property or that of or our Users.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect Information from unauthorized access and improper use. We keep Information on servers that are protected by firewalls and located in a physically secure facility accessible only to authorized&nbsp;employees. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though, that, despite our reasonable efforts, no security measures are impenetrable and any connection to GameNutt or information transmitted to us or to GameNutt will be at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Links from the Site</strong></p>
<p>GameNutt provides links to the websites of many of our Business Partners. If you link to any of these third party Web sites, our privacy policy will not apply to your use of, and activities on, those sites. We encourage you to read the legal notices posted on these sites, including their privacy policies. Sweet Gamer LLC, shall have no responsibility or liability for your visitation to, and the data collection and use practices of, these sites. All inquiries concerning the use of PII by a third party must be communicated to that third party and not to GameNutt or Sweet Gamer LLC.</p>
<p><strong>Deactivate Software</strong></p>
<p>Users who have downloaded the Software and who do not want their NPII collected as described above should immediately deactivate the Software. You may deactivate the Software by visiting the <a href="http://www.gamenutt.com/uninstall/">Uninstall Page</a> and follow the directions to remove the Software from your computer, or by selecting the appropriate entry in your Control Panel using the “Add or Remove Programs” icon. Deactivating the Software means that you will no longer have access to the Games on the Site.</p>
