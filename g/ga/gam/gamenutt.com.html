It includes, for example, information about Your Internet service provider, operating system, type of browser, geographic location, and pages viewed on the Site. Although this information is related to You, it is not associated with Your PII and cannot be linked to You personally.</p>
<p><strong>If You do not want Your Information to continue to be collected and used as provided in this Privacy Policy, You should not access or use this Site again.</strong></p>
<p>Game players have access to the Games at no charge in exchange for their agreement to install the software (the âSoftwareâ) on their computers or other computing device. The Software provides You with a browser toolbar, ad presentation, or other functionality. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No PII is collected through the Software</span>.</p>

By providing Us with Your PII using any of these features, You are authorizing Our use and sharing of Your PII as described in this Policy and any subsequent revisions to this Policy that We may publish on the Site.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Childrenâs Privacy</strong> The Site and the content available or emails delivered in connection with the Site, are neither intended for, nor directed to, nor to be accessed by, persons under the age of 13. <strong>We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under 13 years of age.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Framing/Masking</strong> <strong>Some of Our pages utilize framing techniques to serve content to from Our partners while preserving the look and feel of Our site. Please be aware that You are providing Your personal information to these third parties.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Use and Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information</strong> We will share Your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.  We do not sell Your personal information to third parties.</p>
<p></p><p>We reserve the right to use PII: (1) for the specific purpose for which such information was provided as stated above; (2) for the purposes disclosed at the time such information is provided; or (3) as disclosed in this Policy.</p>
<p>In addition, if We go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, Your PII will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified by a prominent notice on the the Site home page for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of Your PII.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose PII as required by law and when We believe that disclosure is necessary to protect Our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong> As with many websites, when You visit Our Site, the Site automatically gathers certain NPII based on Your computer information and stores it in log files. This type of technical and statistical information is used to customize Your experience at the Site, to help Us improve the quality of the Site and to make Your visits to the Site easy, convenient and fun. We also collect Your IP (Internet protocol) address to help diagnose problems with the site server and for Site administration purposes.</p>
<p>Finally, We and some of Our Third Party Advertisers as well as third party ad servers also use cookies, web beacons, clear GIFs, and other monitoring technologies to gather anonymous information. The most common of these technologies are described in more detail below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies</span>. Cookies are small data files that the Site server places on an individualâs computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site and the Company. We do not tie any PII to the cookies that We set. Cookies also enable Us, or Our Third Party Advertisers, to use anonymous behavioral profiles and demographic inferences to increase the relevance of online ads that Premium Members receive. Some Site ads include âweb beaconsâ and some of Our Third Party Advertisers may include web beacons on some of their web pages at Our request. These web beacons allow Us to access the cookies We set and provide ad campaign analysis. While some Web browsers allow a User to automatically reject all cookies or be notified when a cookie is about to be placed on the Userâs computer, disabling this feature may compromise the efficiency and added services that Our cookies provide. If You ever uninstall the Software, no Site cookies or tracking assets will remain. <strong>The use of cookies by Third Party Advertisers or ad servers is not subject to this Policy, but is subject to those third partiesâ respective privacy policies. If You have a question about such third partiesâ privacy policies, You will have to go to their websites for more information and/or contact them directly</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clear GIFs</span>. We employ or Our third party business partners may employ a common technology known as a âClear GIFâ or â1-by-1 Pixelâ on the Site and in e-mail communications with Users. A Clear GIF, or âgraphic interface formatâ is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1Ã1 pixel) that is placed on the Site or in an e-mail. The GIFs do not contain any PII but they, provide Us with important information about how Users use the Site and respond to e-mail messages. With this information, We or Our Business Partners are better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative presentations. We may also allow Our Third Party Advertisers the ability to use GIFs on the Site solely to track Premium Users who link from the Third Party Advertisersâ respective sites to Our Site.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flash LSOs</span> On some of Our sites Our third party gaming partners use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to provide games and participate in tournaments.  Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.  Cookie management tools provided by Your browser will not remove Flash cookies.  To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118</a></p>
