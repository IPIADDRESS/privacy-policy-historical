GameFly knows that your
privacy is important to you. This Privacy Policy explains how we use the
personal information that you submit to us; please take a few moments to read
it. <span class="bold">By visiting GameFly.com, you are accepting the terms and practices
described in this Privacy Policy.</span>
<br><br>


<span class="bold">Why GameFly Collects Information</span><br>
All of the personal
information we collect is used to make GameFly.com more enjoyable and more
useful for our members.
<br><br>


When you join GameFly, we
ask you for certain personally identifying information, including your full
name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, and billing information
(such as a credit card number). We use this personally identifying information
to create your GameFly account, process your orders, and communicate with you
about the status of your orders.
<br><br>

We also use your e-mail
address to send you GameFly newsletters. In addition, we may occasionally send
special offers and promotional information to you via e-mail. If you wish to
opt out of receiving such newsletters, special offers, and promotional
information, log in to <a href="/member/account.asp">Your Account </a>and
change your E-mail Subscriptions.
<br><br>

We will use your phone
number only for customer service-related calls, never for sales or marketing
purposes.
<br><br>

<span class="bold">Types of Information GameFly Collects</span><br>



There are several kinds of information we collect from visitors to our site. They include:<br><br>


<span class="italics">Information You Give Us</span><br>
When you first become a
GameFly member, we ask you to give us your name, address, phone number, credit
card number, and other personally identifying information so that we can
process and ship your orders. We may also use this information for such
purposes as answering your requests, communicating order information to you,
and improving our service.
<br><br>

<span class="italics">Automatic Information</span>

<br>Like many Web sites,
<span class="bold">GameFly.com</span> sets “cookies” on your computer. Cookies are alphanumeric
identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web
browser, allowing us to automatically identify you when you return to our site.
They help us to match the games you’ve chosen to rent or buy with your
individual account, and to personalize the GameFly.com Web site for you.
<br>

If cookies are not enabled on your Web browser, you
will not be able to use the GameFly.com site or the GameFly service. The “help”
menu on most Web browsers will tell you how to enable cookies.

<br><br>

Your order and billing
history are also tracked automatically from the beginning of your GameFly
membership. This allows you to log in to <a href="/member/account.asp">Your
Account</a> and see a complete list of games you’ve rented or bought
from us.

<br>
<br>

<span class="bold">Security</span>

<br>
GameFly uses a secure server
to encrypt all of your personal information. The secure server employs Secure
Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, the most advanced encryption method available
today.

<br>
<br>

To protect your information
from unauthorized access or use, we use only the most advanced technology and
security features for the <span class="bold">GameFly.com</span> site. We will continue to update
and enhance our security practices as new technology becomes available. We have
also implemented strict security guidelines for our employees, partners, and
vendors.

<br>
<br>

While we make every effort
to ensure the security of your personal information, no data transmission can
be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, please be aware that when you
submit information to us, you do so at your own risk.

<br>
<br>

<span class="bold">Sharing of Information</span>

<br>

Except as described below,
GameFly does not sell, rent, or share your personally identifying information
to third parties without:<br><br>
1.) Notifying you of our intent to share such information, and <br>
2.) Giving you a chance to prevent your information from being shared.

<br>
<br>

We use outside companies,
agents, and contractors to perform some important GameFly tasks, such as
processing credit card transactions and delivering your orders. In the course
of doing so, these third parties can come into contact with some of your
personally identifying information. However, we only give them access to the
information they need in order to actually perform their tasks, and they are
bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy—that is, they must treat your
personal information the same way we do.

<br>
<br>

If we think that their
products or services will interest our members, we may also partner with
outside companies to send promotional announcements to some members. If you
want to be excluded from these promotional mailings, you may opt out by logging
in to <a href="/member/account.asp">Your Account</a> and updating your
E-mail Subscriptions.
<br><br>

We may, at our discretion,
provide our prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties with
aggregate data about members and visitors to the GameFly.com site. However,
such data is anonymous, and we do not disclose personally identifying
information about specific users.

<br><br>

GameFly reserves the right
to disclose users’ personal information when required by law to do so.
<br><br>



<span class="bold">Updating Your Information</span>

<br>To view or update your name,
e-mail address, password, billing address, credit card number, e-mail
subscription preferences, or other account information, log in to
<a href="/member/account.asp">Your Account.</a> There is a link to
<a href="/member/account.asp">Your Account</a> on most pages of the GameFly.com
site. Please note that you must log in with your e-mail address and password
before you can update any account information.
<br><br>

If you believe that your
account information contains errors, and you cannot correct those errors from
the <a href="/member/account.asp">Your Account</a> page, please contact <a href="/help/contactus.asp">
Customer Service</a>.
<br><br>

<span class="bold">E-mail Privacy</span>
<br>

When you join GameFly, you
are automatically subscribed to our newsletters, which may include special
offers and promotional materials from GameFly or select GameFly partners. If
you wish to opt out of receiving such offers and promotions, please log in to 
<a href="/member/account.asp">Your Account</a> and update your E-mail Subscriptions
<br><br>

Under the GameFly referral
program, you can help spread the word about GameFly by providing us with your
friends’ names and e-mail addresses. In return, we provide your friends with
free GameFly trial memberships. Names and e-mail addresses submitted to us for
this program will be used <span class="bold">only</span> to send these free trial offers. GameFly
does not share referral program names or e-mail addresses with any third
parties.
<br><br>

<span class="bold">GameFly and Children</span>
<br>

Though the GameFly service
is fun for all ages, you must be 18 years or older to create a GameFly account
and become a member. If you are under 18, you may use GameFly.com only with the
involvement of a parent or guardian.
<br><br>

<span class="bold">How You Can Safeguard Your Privacy</span>
<br>

While we’re always working
hard to keep your personal information safe, you must play an important role as
well. Take care to prevent unauthorized persons from learning any of your
GameFly account information. 
<br><br>

If you choose to submit game
reviews or postings to message boards or other public areas of the GameFly.com
Web site, please be aware that these areas are, in fact, public. In other
words, don’t submit personal or account information (such as your credit card
number or password) in your posts.
<br><br>

You are solely responsible
for safeguarding your GameFly e-mail login and password. To prevent
unauthorized use of your account, be sure to change your password often, and
keep it in a safe place.
<br><br>

<span class="bold">Notices</span>
<br>

By visiting GameFly.com or
using the GameFly service, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject
to this Privacy Policy and our <a href="/help/termsofuse.asp">Terms of Use</a>,
including any limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application
of the law of the state of California. If you have a concern about privacy
protection at GameFly.com, please send a detailed description of the issue to <a href="mailto:feedback@gamefly.com">support@gamefly.com</a>, and we will try to
resolve it.
<br><br>

The GameFly Web site and service will evolve over time, and so will this Privacy Policy. Our use of any
information we gather is subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy that is in
effect at the time we use the information. We may e-mail you periodically to
notify you of updates to our Privacy Policy or <a href="/help/termsofuse.asp">Terms
of Use</a>, but you should visit our Web site frequently to view any
recent changes.
<br><br>


<span class="bold">Contact</span>
<br>

If you have any questions or
concerns about this Privacy Policy, or about your GameFly membership, please
