<h2>Our Commitment to Your Privacy:</h2>
<div class="subheader">
<p>Your privacy is very important to Gaikai. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, store, use and disseminate certain information that we collect from you and other customers, visitors and users of the various web site and web pages that covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>By accessing and using such web site(s), you consent to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy regarding the collection, storage and use of the particular information that you choose to provide to us.</p>
</div>
<h3>Data Collection</h3>
<p>Gaikai may collect, store and use the following types of information and related data:</p>
<ul>
<li>information of or concerning your visits to web sites and web pages that are owned or controlled by Gaikai or its licensors or licensees (as applicable), and</li>
<li>information that you provide to us for the purpose of becoming a registered user and/or otherwise using any of the products or services of Gaikai and its licensors and/or licensees (as applicable).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use of Information and Related Data</h3>
<p>Information and data provided by our customers, visitors and users is used to communicate with such individuals about the subjects of their requests or, to the extent applicable, to provide information about the products and services of Gaikai and  			its licensors and/or licensees (as applicable), and for the other purposes specified in this Privacy Policy or in relevant portions of the web sites that are covered by this Privacy Policy. In addition to the uses identified herein and/or elsewhere  			in this Privacy Policy, we may use your personal information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>contact you in connection with, and to deliver products and/or services (or related information or data) that you have requested,</li>
<li>verify your authorization to access and use the web sites and/or web pages that are covered by this Privacy Policy,</li>
<li>improve your browsing experience by personalizing portions of the web sites and/or web pages that are covered by this Privacy Policy, and</li>
<li>provide you via email or other communication technology with information relating to the products and services of Gaikai and its licensors and/or licensees (as applicable) that we think may be of interest to you.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data Protection</h3>
<p>Gaikai uses reasonable care to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or misappropriation. However, data transmission over the Internet is inherently insecure and, accordingly, Gaikai cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness  			or security of data transmitted or received via the Internet.</p>
<h3>Potential Disclosures:</h3>
<p>Gaikai will not disclose personally identifiable information to any third party unless:</p>
<ul>
<li>we are required to do so by applicable law or regulation,</li>
<li>in order to establish, exercise, protect and/or defend our legal rights,</li>
<li>in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal action, and</li>
<li>to protect the safety or sensitivities of other individuals who use the web sites and/or web pages that are covered by this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
<p>The web sites that are covered by this Privacy Policy are intended for a general audience and are not specifically intended for children under the age of 13. The privacy interests of children are very important to Gaikai and we encourage parents and  			legal guardians of children to play an active role in the online activities of their children. Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will not collect personally identifiable information from any child  			under the age of 13 unless we have received consent from a relevant parent or legal guardian.</p>
<h3>Third-Party Web Sites:</h3>
<p>The web site(s) that are covered by this Privacy Policy may contain links to other web sites or web pages that are not owned or controlled by Gaikai and for which Gaikai has no control or responsibility (collectively, "Third Party Web Sites"). Any  			such links that are provided by Gaikai or any of its licensors or licensees (as applicable) are being provided only as a convenience to you and other interested users of such web sites and for no other purpose. You acknowledge and agree that neither  			Gaikai nor any of its licensors or licensees is or will be deemed responsible for the content of any such Third Party Web Sites. You further agree that your access and use of any Third Party Web Sites will be subject to the third-party privacy policies  			that are applicable to such web sites.</p>
<h3>Gaikai Service Location</h3>
<p>Our computer systems and server networks are currently located in the United States, so your personal data will be collected and stored by us in the U.S. where privacy regulations and data protection requirements may not offer the same level of  			protection as in other parts of the world. If you submit information and/or related data as a visitor from outside the U.S. to any of the web site(s) covered by this Privacy Policy, your decision to access and use such web site shall confirm your  			agreement to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and shall indicate your consent to the transmission to and reception of such information and related data in the United States and to the storage, processing and use of such information  			and data in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>California Privacy Rights</h3>
<p>Individuals who are residents of California and who choose to access and use any of the web site(s) that are covered by this Privacy Policy are entitled to request certain information regarding the disclosure of their personal information to  			third parties for any use relating to such third party's direct marketing activities (See, California Civil Code Section 1798.83).</p>
<h3>Modification of this Privacy Policy:</h3>
<p>Gaikai reserves the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time, without prior notice and without any obligation or liability to you or any third parties. It is your responsibility, as a voluntary user of  			any web site(s) that are covered by this Privacy Policy, to confirm the effective the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy in order to help ensure that you are aware of any modification or amendment to this Privacy Policy that may be adopted by Gaikai.</p>
