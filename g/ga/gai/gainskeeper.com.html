GainsKeeper uses the information you enter to provide its tax lot accounting service, such as custom Capital Gain/Loss and 
Schedule D reports with the user name and address in the report header for proper tax filing.  We also use personal information to 
do research on demographics, interests, and behavior. Our research is done to better understand and serve our users. 
For example, GainsKeeper uses investment information to determine what type of trading
activity the majority of our users undertake.  In general, if our users are trading more mutual funds than stocks we can
target future development efforts on services focused on mutual fund analysis.  A past study of this kind indicated 
that a large portion of our users required option functionality, and we made development plans accordingly to now offer this.  
This information and analysis is compiled only on an aggregated basis for general statistics.  
<br><br>
There are opportunities where individuals can opt-in to receive a premium service from GainsKeeper or its partners. 
An example of opt-in premium services are
if GainsKeeper partners with a brokerage or an advisory company to provide a GainsKeeper 
members with services, such as automatic data downloads.  GainsKeeper members will opt-in to 
elect this type of premium service before any personally identifiable information is shared.
