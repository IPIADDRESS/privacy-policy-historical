We encourage you to spend time  online with your children and to become familiar with the types of content  available through the Service and the Internet in general. You should regularly oversee the kids' use of  e-mail and other online communication and transactional features.<br>
    <strong>BEFORE  YOU OR A CHILD AUTHORIZED BY YOU (FOR WHOM YOU ARE A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN)  MAY ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE, READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY.

Ganz keeps full and complete title to  the Software and all Intellectual Property Rights therein.

</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Free Trial. </strong>From time to time, Ganz may offer a free  trial subscription to the Service. Trial  subscriptions are not transferable.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Beta Tests. </strong>From time to time, Ganz may offer you the  opportunity to review and evaluate a game prior to its commercial release for  the sole purpose of evaluating the game and identifying errors. &nbsp;This  process is known as a "Beta Test". The beta games are provided for testing on an "as is" and  "as available" basis and Ganz makes no warranty to you of any kind,  express or implied, with respect to such beta games. Furthermore, nothing herein shall be  construed as granting you any rights or privileges of any kind with respect to  beta games. When playing some beta games, you may accumulate online currencies,  game points or other items. Such data  may be erased when the testing phase is complete. You understand and agree that the pre-release  copy and all other Content provided to you by Ganz during the Beta Test are  confidential and proprietary information owned by Ganz. &nbsp;You agree as a  condition of participating in a Beta Test to safeguard the pre-release Content  and prevent its copying, reproduction or unauthorized access, disclosure or  use. &nbsp;Your obligation to keep the Beta Test Content confidential will  continue until Ganz publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed it to the  public, through no fault of yours. </li>
  <li><strong>CONTENT </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All content offered by Ganz through  the Service, including but not limited to audio, video, text, graphics, images  and information and all other material appearing on or emanating to and/or from  the Service, as well as their overall design and appearance, (collectively and  individually, "Content") is owned, controlled or licensed by or to Ganz,  and is protected by trade dress, copyright, patent and trademark laws, and  various other intellectual property rights and unfair competition laws within  and outside of Canada. You acknowledge that any reliance upon any review, advice,  opinion, statement, or other Content, is at your sole risk. Such Content is  presented for educational, entertainment and informational purposes only and is  not intended to be a substitute for professional advice of any sort, including,  without limitation, medical, legal, tax, investment or insurance advice.  <br>
  Subject  to the <a target="_blank" id="terms-of-use" href="http://www.ganzworld.com/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a> and so long as you remain compliant with the <a target="_blank" id="terms-of-use" href="http://www.ganzworld.com/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a>,  Ganz grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable, fully  revocable licence to use such Content in conjunction with the Service. You may  not modify, publish, transmit, transfer, sell, reproduce, upload, post, perform, display, create derivative works  from, in any way exploit such Content or distribute it in any way (including  "mirroring") to any other computer, server, website or other medium  for publication or distribution or for any commercial purpose, except as Ganz  expressly permits in the <a target="_blank" id="terms-of-use" href="http://www.ganzworld.com/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a>. For clarification purposes only, a  "derivative work based on" the Content is a work substantially  similar, both in ideas and expression, to the Content. Similarity of ideas in  the Content and derivative works concern similarities between things such as  plot, theme, mood, setting, appearance, and character traits. Similarity of  expression concerns the total concept and feel of the Content and the  derivative works. Thus, if a work created by you or someone other than Ganz is  likely to bring to mind the Content, then it is likely that such work is a  derivative work of the Content, and as such may not be used for commercial  purposes. <br>
  You  may use information on Ganz products and services purposely made available by  Ganz for downloading for your own personal, non-commercial use, provided that  you agree not to remove, obscure, or alter copyright, patent, trademark, or  other proprietary right notices affixed to such Content, or block visual  elements adjoining such Content. Without limiting the generality of the Terms  of Use, you shall not use any Content on any other website or network computer  environment or in a manner that suggests an association with any of our  Services or Ganz itself, or in a manner that disparages us. <br>
  Ganz  reserves all rights in Ganz-owned and licensed Content that are not expressly  granted to you in the <a target="_blank" id="terms-of-use" href="http://www.ganzworld.com/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a>.&nbsp; Making unauthorized copies of the  Content may result in the termination of your Account, prohibition to use the  Service, and further legal action. </p>
<p>We take great care and pride in the  Service and are always on the lookout for technical glitches that affect it.  When we find them on our end, we will fix them. Unfortunately, your home computer may cause  some glitches that affect how you see our Site and that is beyond our control. </p>
<p>If you experience any unusual  behavior, content or ads on the Site, it may be the result of Malware on your  computer. Malware is a term used to broadly classify a form of software which  is installed in a computer system with malicious intentions, usually without  the owner's knowledge or permission. Malware includes computer viruses, key  loggers, malicious active content, rogue programs and dialers, among others.  While we continuously work closely with our partners to ensure that the Service  is delivered property, sometimes Malware programs on your personal computer may  interfere with your experience on our Site and on other sites that you visit. </p>
<p>We suggest that you take some of the  following actions which may assist in cleaning your computer and which could  prevent future installations of Malware. </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Update your computer via Windows Update (found in the       Tools menu in your Internet Explorer web browser);</li>
  <li>Install a SpyWare Removal Tool to clean your computer       of Malware, e.g. Spybot Search and       Destroy or AdAware; </li>
  <li>Install antivirus software; </li>
  <li>Install Microsoft Defender (for Windows computers). </li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that we cannot be  responsible for the effects of any third-party software including Malware on  your computer system. Please make sure to carefully read the Help or Customer  Support areas of any software download site. If you do discover any Malware on  your system, we also suggest you speak with a qualified computer technician.  If, after taking the above actions, you are still experiencing any problems,  please feel free to contact our Customer Service Representative.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SALES POLICY</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>From  time to time, Ganz may offer, for "real world" money, licences to use  (a) "virtual currency", including but not limited to virtual coins,  cash, tokens, or points, all for use in the Service; (b) "virtual in-game items" (together with  "virtual currency", "eStore Items"); and (c) other goods or  services . Where offered, you may also be able to obtain a licence to use  eStore Items by redeeming third party virtual currency such as Facebook  Credits. <br>
  Where  offered, you may place an order by visiting the purchase page in one of our  games and following the applicable rules. When you place an order, we may send  you a confirmatory e-mail that will contain details of your order. Please check  that the details in the confirmatory e-mail are correct as soon as possible and  maintain a copy of it for your records. Ganz keeps records of transactions in  order to deal with any subsequent queries. If you purchase Facebook Credits  from Facebook, you are agreeing to Facebook's Payment Terms and Ganz is not a  party to that transaction.<br>
  For  eStore Items, your order will represent an offer to us to acquire a licence which  will be accepted by us when we make the eStore Items available in your Account  for you to use in our games or debit your credit card, whichever comes first.  If you reside in the European Union and you purchase a product or service from  Ganz, you have the right to withdraw from a purchase within seven calendar  days, commencing on the day after the date of purchase (the "Cooling Off  Period"). However, you lose your right of withdrawal if the performance of  the services begins before the end of the Cooling Off Period. Accordingly,  please note that if you order eStore Items from us, your right of withdrawal is  lost as the performance of our services begins immediately once your order is  placed with us.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>In-Game Currency and Game Points</strong>. In-game currency is  not a real currency or any type of financial instrument but rather a virtual  token representing contractual permission from Ganz to access various features  of the Service. In order to obtain the  in-game currency (e.g. eStore Points), you may be required to either use  Facebook Credits or provide us or another payment service designated by us with  your credit card information and other information related to your credit card  transaction (e.g., your billing and shipping address on record with the  applicable credit card company, your credit card expiration date, etc.). You  may be awarded game points by playing games and completing in-game challenges,  or through certain promotional events. When offered, you may be able to  exchange game points earned for game points used on an Affiliated Site. All eStore Items obtained from Ganz in-game will  be included in your Account until the earlier of your Account's expiration or  termination date, or such date when the Service is discontinued. REGARDLESS OF THE CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR  PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR THE ESTORE ITEMS, INCLUDING ESTORE POINTS, YOU DO NOT HAVE  ANY OWNERSHIP RIGHT IN THEM. NO INTEREST  IS PAID OR EARNED ON THE REMAINING BALANCE.&nbsp; </li>
  <li><strong>Fees and Taxes</strong>. Our  published fees and billing procedures apply to the payment of fees and are  incorporated herein by this reference. You may pay fees using the methods available for the particular Service  and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable to each payment method you  choose.&nbsp; When you provide credit card or other payment information to Ganz,  you represent to Ganz that you are the authorized user of the credit card or  other payment method.&nbsp;&nbsp; YOU ARE FULLY LIABLE FOR ALL CHARGES TO YOUR  ACCOUNT AND YOUR CHOSEN METHOD OF PAYMENT. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ONCE YOU  AUTHORIZE US OR ANOTHER DESIGNATED PAYMENT SERVICE TO CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD  FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT, SUCH AMOUNT SHALL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE REFUNDABLE IN  WHOLE OR IN PART, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, UPON TERMINATION OF YOUR  ACCOUNT FOR ANY REASON, TERMINATION OF THE TERMS OF USE, TERMINATION OF THE ONLINE  STORE AND/OR INTERRUPTION OR DISCONTINUATION OF THE SERVICE. If you choose a  recurring subscription to any Service, you acknowledge that payments will be  processed automatically until you cancel the subscription or the Account. </li>
  <li><strong>Order Processing. </strong>If  you place an eStore Item order with Ganz, you warrant that (i) you are of the  age of majority in your jurisdiction, (ii) your use of the particular credit  card or other accepted method of payment is authorized, (iii) all information  that you submit is true and accurate, and (iv) you agree to pay all fees you  incur, including all recurring subscription fees unless and until you  affirmatively terminate the Service or Account in accordance with the steps  outlined by Ganz. Where and to the  extent required by applicable laws, you will be able to verify and modify your  order information before confirming your order. Where offered, you will receive an e-mail receipt from Ganz providing  full details of your purchase/subscription as well as have the purchase  recorded in your Account history. </li>
  <li><strong>Price Changes.</strong> Ganz may change prices and fees at any time, without notice. If you pay a  periodic subscription fee, Ganz will provide you with notice of any change to  the fee or billing method in advance. </li>
  <li><strong>USER GENERATED CONTENT</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While using the Service, you may be given the opportunity  to submit to Ganz, among other things, (i) images, art, and/or fiction and/or  (ii) comments, suggestions, ideas, notes, feedback, concepts or other  information (collectively referred to as "<strong>User Generated Content</strong>"). User Generated Content may be solicited or  unsolicited. Except as expressly stated  in the <a target="_blank" id="terms-of-use" href="http://www.ganzworld.com/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a>, its provisions apply equally to Unsolicited User Generated  Content and Solicited User Generated Content (collectively and individually, "<strong>User Generated Content</strong>" or "<strong>Submission"</strong>). "<strong>Solicited User  Generated Content</strong>" means those submissions (a) that we expressly  request or enable you to provide to us via any feature or activity for our  review or display and possible specifically-defined consideration or  compensation (collectively, "<strong>Consideration</strong>") (such as prizes  or other value in games, contests and promotions); and (b) that you distribute  for which you do not seek Consideration (such as through our social  communication features). "<strong>Unsolicited  User Generated Content</strong>" includes any and all submissions that do not  fall within the above subparagraphs (a) or (b).<br>
  By transmitting  or submitting any User Generated Content through the Service, you affirm,  represent and warrant that such transmission or submission is (a) accurate and  not confidential; (b) not in violation of any laws, contractual restrictions or  other third party rights, and that you have permission from any third party  whose personal information or intellectual property is comprised in the User  Generated Content; (c) free of viruses, adware, spyware, worms or other  malicious code; and (d) you acknowledge and agree that any of your personal  information within such content will at all times be governed by the Privacy  Policy.  Ganz may, without prior notice to you, remove User Generated Content including that  which appears to infringe the intellectual property or other rights of third  parties. <br>
  DO NOT SUBMIT ANY UNSOLICITED  USER GENERATED CONTENT; NO IMPLIED CONTRACT. Our long-standing company  policy does not allow us to accept or consider Unsolicited User Generated  Content so please do not submit it. We want to avoid the possibility of future  misunderstandings when projects developed by us or under our direction might  seem to others to be similar to their own creative work.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Beta Tests. </strong>From time to time, Ganz may offer you the  opportunity to review and evaluate a game prior to its commercial release for  the sole purpose of evaluating the game and identifying errors. &nbsp;This  process is known as a "Beta Test". The beta games are provided for testing on an "as is" and  "as available" basis and Ganz makes no warranty to you of any kind,  express or implied, with respect to such beta games. Furthermore, nothing herein shall be  construed as granting you any rights or privileges of any kind with respect to  beta games.

You understand and agree that the pre-release  copy and all other Content provided to you by Ganz during the Beta Test are  confidential and proprietary information owned by Ganz. &nbsp;You agree as a  condition of participating in a Beta Test to safeguard the pre-release Content  and prevent its copying, reproduction or unauthorized access, disclosure or  use. &nbsp;Your obligation to keep the Beta Test Content confidential will  continue until Ganz publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed it to the  public, through no fault of yours. </li>
  <li><strong>CONTENT </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All content offered by Ganz through  the Service, including but not limited to audio, video, text, graphics, images  and information and all other material appearing on or emanating to and/or from  the Service, as well as their overall design and appearance, (collectively and  individually, "Content") is owned, controlled or licensed by or to Ganz,  and is protected by trade dress, copyright, patent and trademark laws, and  various other intellectual property rights and unfair competition laws within  and outside of Canada. You acknowledge that any reliance upon any review, advice,  opinion, statement, or other Content, is at your sole risk. Such Content is  presented for educational, entertainment and informational purposes only and is  not intended to be a substitute for professional advice of any sort, including,  without limitation, medical, legal, tax, investment or insurance advice.  <br>
  Subject  to the <a target="_blank" id="terms-of-use" href="http://www.ganzworld.com/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a> and so long as you remain compliant with the <a target="_blank" id="terms-of-use" href="http://www.ganzworld.com/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a>,  Ganz grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable, fully  revocable licence to use such Content in conjunction with the Service. You may  not modify, publish, transmit, transfer, sell, reproduce, upload, post, perform, display, create derivative works  from, in any way exploit such Content or distribute it in any way (including  "mirroring") to any other computer, server, website or other medium  for publication or distribution or for any commercial purpose, except as Ganz  expressly permits in the <a target="_blank" id="terms-of-use" href="http://www.ganzworld.com/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a>. For clarification purposes only, a  "derivative work based on" the Content is a work substantially  similar, both in ideas and expression, to the Content. Similarity of ideas in  the Content and derivative works concern similarities between things such as  plot, theme, mood, setting, appearance, and character traits. Similarity of  expression concerns the total concept and feel of the Content and the  derivative works. Thus, if a work created by you or someone other than Ganz is  likely to bring to mind the Content, then it is likely that such work is a  derivative work of the Content, and as such may not be used for commercial  purposes. <br>
  You  may use information on Ganz products and services purposely made available by  Ganz for downloading for your own personal, non-commercial use, provided that  you agree not to remove, obscure, or alter copyright, patent, trademark, or  other proprietary right notices affixed to such Content, or block visual  elements adjoining such Content. Without limiting the generality of the Terms  of Use, you shall not use any Content on any other website or network computer  environment or in a manner that suggests an association with any of our  Services or Ganz itself, or in a manner that disparages us. <br>
  Ganz  reserves all rights in Ganz-owned and licensed Content that are not expressly  granted to you in the <a target="_blank" id="terms-of-use" href="http://www.ganzworld.com/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a>.&nbsp; Making unauthorized copies of the  Content may result in the termination of your Account, prohibition to use the  Service, and further legal action. </p>

  <li><strong>SALES POLICY</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>From  time to time, Ganz may offer, for "real world" money, licences to use  (a) "virtual currency", including but not limited to virtual coins,  cash, tokens, or points, all for use in the Service; (b) "virtual in-game items" (together with  "virtual currency", "eStore Items"); and (c) other goods or  services . Where offered, you may also be able to obtain a licence to use  eStore Items by redeeming third party virtual currency such as Facebook  Credits. <br>
  Where  offered, you may place an order by visiting the purchase page in one of our  games and following the applicable rules. When you place an order, we may send  you a confirmatory e-mail that will contain details of your order. Please check  that the details in the confirmatory e-mail are correct as soon as possible and  maintain a copy of it for your records. Ganz keeps records of transactions in  order to deal with any subsequent queries. If you purchase Facebook Credits  from Facebook, you are agreeing to Facebook's Payment Terms and Ganz is not a  party to that transaction.<br>
  For  eStore Items, your order will represent an offer to us to acquire a licence which  will be accepted by us when we make the eStore Items available in your Account  for you to use in our games or debit your credit card, whichever comes first.  If you reside in the European Union and you purchase a product or service from  Ganz, you have the right to withdraw from a purchase within seven calendar  days, commencing on the day after the date of purchase (the "Cooling Off  Period"). However, you lose your right of withdrawal if the performance of  the services begins before the end of the Cooling Off Period. Accordingly,  please note that if you order eStore Items from us, your right of withdrawal is  lost as the performance of our services begins immediately once your order is  placed with us.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>In-Game Currency and Game Points</strong>. In-game currency is  not a real currency or any type of financial instrument but rather a virtual  token representing contractual permission from Ganz to access various features  of the Service. In order to obtain the  in-game currency (e.g. eStore Points), you may be required to either use  Facebook Credits or provide us or another payment service designated by us with  your credit card information and other information related to your credit card  transaction (e.g., your billing and shipping address on record with the  applicable credit card company, your credit card expiration date, etc.). You  may be awarded game points by playing games and completing in-game challenges,  or through certain promotional events. When offered, you may be able to  exchange game points earned for game points used on an Affiliated Site. All eStore Items obtained from Ganz in-game will  be included in your Account until the earlier of your Account's expiration or  termination date, or such date when the Service is discontinued. REGARDLESS OF THE CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR  PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR THE ESTORE ITEMS, INCLUDING ESTORE POINTS, YOU DO NOT HAVE  ANY OWNERSHIP RIGHT IN THEM. NO INTEREST  IS PAID OR EARNED ON THE REMAINING BALANCE.&nbsp; </li>
  <li><strong>Fees and Taxes</strong>. Our  published fees and billing procedures apply to the payment of fees and are  incorporated herein by this reference.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ONCE YOU  AUTHORIZE US OR ANOTHER DESIGNATED PAYMENT SERVICE TO CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD  FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT, SUCH AMOUNT SHALL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE REFUNDABLE IN  WHOLE OR IN PART, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, UPON TERMINATION OF YOUR  ACCOUNT FOR ANY REASON, TERMINATION OF THE TERMS OF USE, TERMINATION OF THE ONLINE  STORE AND/OR INTERRUPTION OR DISCONTINUATION OF THE SERVICE.

Where and to the  extent required by applicable laws, you will be able to verify and modify your  order information before confirming your order. Where offered, you will receive an e-mail receipt from Ganz providing  full details of your purchase/subscription as well as have the purchase  recorded in your Account history. </li>

  <li><strong>USER GENERATED CONTENT</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While using the Service, you may be given the opportunity  to submit to Ganz, among other things, (i) images, art, and/or fiction and/or  (ii) comments, suggestions, ideas, notes, feedback, concepts or other  information (collectively referred to as "<strong>User Generated Content</strong>").

Except as expressly stated  in the <a target="_blank" id="terms-of-use" href="http://www.ganzworld.com/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a>, its provisions apply equally to Unsolicited User Generated  Content and Solicited User Generated Content (collectively and individually, "<strong>User Generated Content</strong>" or "<strong>Submission"</strong>). "<strong>Solicited User  Generated Content</strong>" means those submissions (a) that we expressly  request or enable you to provide to us via any feature or activity for our  review or display and possible specifically-defined consideration or  compensation (collectively, "<strong>Consideration</strong>") (such as prizes  or other value in games, contests and promotions); and (b) that you distribute  for which you do not seek Consideration (such as through our social  communication features). "<strong>Unsolicited  User Generated Content</strong>" includes any and all submissions that do not  fall within the above subparagraphs (a) or (b).<br>
  By transmitting  or submitting any User Generated Content through the Service, you affirm,  represent and warrant that such transmission or submission is (a) accurate and  not confidential; (b) not in violation of any laws, contractual restrictions or  other third party rights, and that you have permission from any third party  whose personal information or intellectual property is comprised in the User  Generated Content; (c) free of viruses, adware, spyware, worms or other  malicious code; and (d) you acknowledge and agree that any of your personal  information within such content will at all times be governed by the Privacy  Policy.  Ganz may, without prior notice to you, remove User Generated Content including that  which appears to infringe the intellectual property or other rights of third  parties. <br>
  DO NOT SUBMIT ANY UNSOLICITED  USER GENERATED CONTENT; NO IMPLIED CONTRACT. Our long-standing company  policy does not allow us to accept or consider Unsolicited User Generated  Content so please do not submit it. We want to avoid the possibility of future  misunderstandings when projects developed by us or under our direction might  seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. In any event, you  agree that any Submission you make is not being made in confidence or trust and  that no confidential or fiduciary relationship is intended or created between  you and us in any way, and that you have no expectation of any review,  compensation or consideration of any type (other than any stated  Consideration). Ganz reserves the right to return Unsolicited User Generated  Content without reviewing it.<br>

When you disclose any information in a forum/chat room,  you do so at your own risk. </p>
<p>Unless  otherwise specified and except for the Service directed to children under the  age of thirteen (13), there is no requirement or expectation that Ganz will  monitor or record any online activity on the Service, including  communications.

<p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Ganz is committed to protecting personal information of its Website users and clients.</strong></p>
<p>Ganz, an Ontario partnership, together with its successors and assigns, is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information entrusted to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We comply with applicable laws regarding collection of information from children, including the United States’ Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and the EU Data Privacy Directive. These and other applicable laws have special requirements regarding notification to parents and legal guardians (either of which is called a “parent” in this Privacy Policy) of what personal information is being collected from their child and how that information is used and shared.&nbsp; We also adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.</p>
<p>When you provide us with your or your child’s personal information, you acknowledge that the information will be stored and processed on servers located in Canada.&nbsp; In the future, our business may require that we contract with service providers outside Canada to carry out certain functions on our behalf such as data back-up or storage.&nbsp; In such situations, such service providers will be contractually obliged not to disclose your and/or your child’s personal information except where authorized to do so by law or by Ganz.&nbsp; Should a need to transfer your and/or your child’s personal information arise, we will ensure that the selected service providers meet our privacy standards before we enter into contracts with them.&nbsp; We will also require them to secure and maintain confidentiality over your information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This policy applies to all information that identifies a particular individual.</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is applicable to personally identifiable information (“PII”) of all users collected, stored or distributed through the website or mobile game, on which it is posted (collectively and individually, “Website”).&nbsp; When this Privacy Policy uses the term “PII”, we mean information that identifies a particular individual.&nbsp; When certain other non-identifiable information is directly associated with PII, this other information also becomes PII for purposes of this Privacy Policy. Some jurisdictions may call personally identifiable information “personal data” or “personally identifying information,” and may include opinions about or related to a user within the definition of PII. We sometimes refer to PII in this Privacy Policy as “personal information.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ganz collects personal information that is voluntarily provided by you when you order a product, enter promotions such as sweepstakes or skill contests, answer our polls or surveys, register as a member on the Website, sign up for additional services on the Website, or communicate with us by mail, telephone or electronically. The type of information we collect and maintain may include your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, gender, date of birth, purchase history, credit card number, chat room communications, complaints you may have about our products or services, a record of promotions offered to you, your Ganz product preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>By continued use of the Website or clicking “I agree” you consent to the collection and processing of your and/or your child’s personal information.</strong></p>
<p>By continued use of the Website and/or clicking the “I agree” button below, you signify your consent to the collection and processing of both your personal information and your child’s user account information, and any resulting correlation of such information, as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Personal information will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the form of consent required by law.</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to collect, use, and disclose your and/or your child’s personal information without consent where required or permitted by law.&nbsp; Otherwise, personal information will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the form of consent required by applicable law and its use will be limited to the objectives for which it was collected as described herein. The form of your consent can vary from implied consent to express consent, depending on the circumstances and sensitivity of the information collected. We will rely on implied consent when we can reasonably conclude that you have given your consent by your action (e.g. by giving us your name and contact information so that we may send you the items ordered) or inaction (e.g. by not exercising an ability to opt-out). This Privacy Policy identifies the purposes for which your personal information is collected, used and disclosed. Additional consent will be obtained from you should we wish to use or disclose your personal information for any additional purpose.</p>
<p><strong>We may gather non-personal information for analytical purposes by means of cookies, beacons and other technology.</strong></p>
<p>To help us better understand our markets, we may gather non-personal information for analytical purposes on an anonymous, aggregate basis.&nbsp; This information is not kept, used or disclosed at the individual level, but may be disclosed to third parties on an anonymous, aggregate basis. We may collect such information through unique identifiers such as cookies (which may be HTML files, Flash files, or other technology), web beacons, or similar technologies for routine system administration purposes, to make our Websites more interesting and useful to you, or to manage content delivery. For instance,</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We use technology to track traffic patterns on the Website. Once you have logged into the Website, we track your activities by using logs of database transactions and server interactions. We also use this information to understand which areas of our Websites are most appealing or least appealing or to deliver content that is specific to your country or area of residence;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We use cookies, small text files stored on your hard drive, not our Website, which allow you to store your password without having to constantly re-enter it. Cookies also help us to tailor messages that better match your needs and interests, and they allow us to better understand how users in general use our sites, which in turn helps us to focus our resources on features that are most popular with our users. Please note that Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove Flash cookies.&nbsp; To learn more about and manage Flash cookies, visit <a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">www.adobe.com</span></a> and make changes at the privacy setting panel.&nbsp; You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our sites may not work properly if you do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not collect, use or disclose your personal information to third parties for online behavioral advertising purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Ad companies collect anonymous data.&nbsp; You can opt out.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>From time to time, we may use third-party advertising service provider to serve ads on the Website. These companies may use cookie-based ad serving technology for the purpose of (i) ad delivery and reporting; and (ii) re-targeting and/or online advanced targeting.&nbsp; Furthermore, to monitor usage or transfer of content to another site or location and to collect advertising metrics, such third parties may include in the content web beacons or clear GIFs.&nbsp; Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an e-mail message.&nbsp; Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are typically very small and the same colour as the background of the web page, document or e-mail message.&nbsp; Because your web browser must request such content from the third parties’ servers, such third parties can track your usage, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>
<p>Although the third-party advertising service providers may not have access to tracking technologies set by Ganz, or any of your personal information collected on the Website, they may themselves set and access their own tracking technologies and/or they may otherwise have access to information about you. The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not ours. Even if Ganz has a relationship with the third party, it does not control its sites or policies and practices regarding your information.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that third-party advertising service providers or advertisers may collect from you. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard. If you would like more information about the practices used by third-party advertising service providers and advertisers and to know your choices about not having the information gathered used by these companies, visit <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">http://networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We don’t collect personal information from children under 13.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Some of the Websites operated by Ganz are not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect information from children under this age on the Website.</p>
<p>For those Websites which may appeal directly to children under the age of 13, we incorporate into this Privacy Policy additional children’s privacy provisions. When your child is asked to provide personal information, we will first collect your (the parent’s) email address and use this information to contact you (the parent) by email to notify you that your child wishes to provide personally identifiable information to us, describe the purposes for which the personal information is collected, and provide you with an opportunity to consent to such disclosure of personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We will collect no more personal information from your child than is reasonably necessary for your child to participate in an online activity. </strong></p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Registration.&nbsp; </strong>During the registration process, the child may be asked to set up a user name and password.&nbsp; Your child should not use any personally identifiable information as his or her user name, as this user name may be visible to others on the Website.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Surveys and Feedback: </strong>&nbsp;We may collect aggregate information in connection with surveys or other online activities that allow your child to give us feedback. We do not collect any personally identifiable information in connection with surveys or feedback requests, nor is the information provided connected to any personally identifiable information we may have about the child.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Site Management:</strong>&nbsp; We may collect information through technology (such as logging IP addresses) for routine system administration purposes, to make our Website more interesting and useful to you and your child, or to manage content delivery. For instance, we collect IP addresses and use technology to track traffic patterns on the site. Once your child has logged into the website, we track your child’s activities by using logs of database transactions and server interactions. We also use this information to understand which areas of our website are most appealing or least appealing and to deliver content that is specific to your country or area of residence. Our site may also use cookies, which are pieces of information that a website sends to your child’s computer while he or she is viewing the website. Cookies provide information to the site so that the site will remember the user. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to our third party service providers who are subject to the protections described in this Privacy Policy. None of the information collected through these methods is connected to or associated with any other information about your child.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Email Communication from You:</strong>&nbsp; If your child contacts us by email or enters an email address when participating in a contest, we use the email address (which is personally identifiable information) only to respond to your child’s specific request or question or to notify them of their winning the contest, after which the address is deleted.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Mail Communication from You:</strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong>If your child wants to contact us by mail, and our site provides a submission form for such communication, you may do so using such submission form.&nbsp; The submission form may ask for your child’s user name and name of his or her game character, and your (the parent’s) name and signature.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Chatting on the Site</strong>.&nbsp; When using scripted chat services on any of the Websites, members select pre-constructed messages from chat menus. Members CANNOT type in their own messages, and no personal information can be disclosed.&nbsp; Parental consent is not required for scripted chat.&nbsp; In the restricted chat area, messages are limited to words from our restricted dictionary, which attempts to exclude all numbers, common proper names and place names, and other personal information.&nbsp; If your child under the age of 13 requests access to the restricted chat area, he or she will be prompted to disclose your email address which we will use for the purpose of providing notice to you and requesting parental consent as required under applicable law.&nbsp; On some Websites, we may offer unrestricted chat – such chat is suitable to adults but is not recommended for children.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Safety and Security:</strong> We may collect your child’s first name and email address and your email address where necessary for your child’s safety.&nbsp; We may also collect your child’s name and email address for the limited purposes of protecting the security and integrity of the site, taking precautions against liability, responding to the judicial process, or for law enforcement on a matter related to public safety.</p>
<p><strong>Use of personal information is limited.</strong></p>
<p>Ganz collects personal information for the following reasons:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide you with the products or services you have requested, including processing your payment;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To better understand you, to allow us to serve you better through enhanced products, customer service and directed promotional efforts of particular interest;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To properly investigate and respond to any complaints, questions or concerns you may have about our products or services; and</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To determine your eligibility for our products and services.</p>
<p>If you opt in to receive offers, promotions or other information from Ganz, your information will be used to provide you with promotional offers for Ganz products that we believe may interest you and to solicit your opinion on our products and services. If you have opted in to receive these offers, we may also use your personal information to ensure that your contact information is accurate and up to date.&nbsp; Ganz does not collect, use or disclose your personal information for online behavioral advertising purposes.</p>
<p>Please note that certain information is required by Ganz to process payment and fulfill orders that you may place through a Website, and if you withdraw your consent to the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information for these purposes, Ganz will not be able to fulfill your orders.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Ganz may share your and/or your child’s personal information with the other members of the Ganz corporate group, and their respective successors and assigns, but only to the extent required to fulfill the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; You may request that Ganz not share your and/or your child’s personal information with any of the other members of the Ganz corporate group by contacting us as described below.&nbsp; In addition to this inter-corporate sharing, Ganz may disclose personal information to third parties as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>To Third Parties To Perform Processing and Other Specialized Services:&nbsp; </strong>At times, Ganz may use outside organizations to perform specialized services such as, but not limited to, contest management or payment processing. These service providers are only given the information needed to perform those services and they are bound contractually to protect the confidentiality, privacy and security of your information and to limit the use of your information to the service being provided.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>To Third Parties in the Event of Legal Reasons:&nbsp; </strong>We advise you that we may disclose personal information to the government or other legal or regulatory authorities (i) if so ordered by a court of law or (ii) for other legal reasons, such as (a) to comply with legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order; (b) to protect the company’s rights and property; (c) to investigate reports of fraud or of users sending material using a false email address or users sending harassing, threatening, or abusive messages; (d) to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Website; or (e) in emergencies, such as when we believe someone’s physical safety is at risk.&nbsp; In some cases, disclosure may be required by law to be without notice to you. <strong></strong></p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>To a Third Party in the Event of a Significant Transaction or Other Event: </strong>In the case of any significant transaction or event involving Ganz or any of its related entities or divisions such as, by way of example, a sale, merger, amalgamation, financing, re-organization, liquidation, or insolvency, other parties to the transaction and their professional advisors may need to have access to Ganz’s customer lists and various databases as part of the due diligence process. In this event, Ganz would only provide such access under terms of a strict confidentiality agreement. Also, upon completion of the transaction or event, your personal information would be transferred to Ganz’s successor-in-interest to be used only for the purposes for which it was collected.</p>
<p><strong>We take steps to protect personal information.</strong></p>
<p>Ganz has implemented physical, electronic and administrative measures to protect your information from error, loss or unauthorized access. For example, we use industry-standard efforts, such as passwords, firewalls and Secure Socket Layers, to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information contained on our computer systems. In addition, our employees and any third parties we use are contractually bound to protect the confidentiality of your information and access is restricted to those with a need to know the information to carry out the identified purpose.</p>
<p><strong>We keep personal information for a reasonable period of time only.</strong></p>
<p>We keep your information for a period reasonably necessary to meet the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any legal requirements, including statutory retention periods. When your personal information is no longer required for a specific purpose or legal requirement, it will be erased from our records.</p>
<p><strong>Parents are urged to supervise their children’s activities online.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Ganz urges all parents and legal guardians to supervise their children’s exploration of the Internet and any online services, and to teach their children about protecting their personal information online.&nbsp; <strong>If you reside in the United States,</strong> we encourage you to visit <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/tech/tec08.shtm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/tech/tec08.shtm</span></a> for more information about COPPA and children’s privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a parent or legal guardian and will be purchasing licenses for codes to Website-related products or services and sending the purchased codes to your child, please be advised that such activity may correlate your child’s Website user account information to your personal information obtained during the purchase process. Although Ganz does not generally correlate this data, in rare circumstances this may be necessary to assist with your use of the Website, a service or otherwise. In compliance with applicable laws we must inform you of the possible correlation and obtain your consent to such correlation should it occur.</p>
<p><strong>Protect your personal information from disclosure on social communication networks.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that in online chat rooms and public user profiles, on message boards or in similar forums on the Website there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality.&nbsp; Any personal information that you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users.&nbsp; Ganz is not responsible for personal information you choose to submit in these forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We provide links to third party websites only as a convenience.&nbsp; Make sure to review their privacy policies.</strong></p>
<p>Users may, through hypertext or other computer “links,” gain access to other websites on the Internet which are not operated by Ganz. Ganz is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Ganz of the website linked to. GANZ ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY MATERIAL OUTSIDE OF THE WEBSITES OPERATED BY GANZ AND ITS AFFILIATES, INCLUDING ANY WEBSITES WHICH MAY BE ACCESSED THROUGH A LINK ON A GANZ OPERATED WEBSITE. Unless otherwise indicated on the Website, Ganz is not sponsored by or affiliated with the linked websites, and trademarks used in connection with the linked websites are not trademarks of Ganz. Ganz specifically disclaims responsibility for any inadvertent viewing by anyone under the applicable age of majority of any material intended for adults on a website accessed through a linked website.&nbsp; While Ganz may provide links from this Website to other websites owned and/or operated by Ganz or unaffiliated third parties, such sites are not part of this Website, and each is governed by a different set of terms. In addition, to the extent such linked websites are not owned or operated by Ganz or its affiliates, these sites also have different policies with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. Make sure to review their privacy policies.</p>
<p><strong>You have control over your personal information. </strong></p>
<p>You have control over how we collect, use and disclose your personal information. Any comments, questions or changes regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information shall be directed to Ganz.<strong></strong></p>
<p>You may choose not to receive email from us, even after granting permission, by unsubscribing. Instructions on how to unsubscribe from emails that are not related to processing of your transactions with us are included in each such email.<strong></strong></p>
<p>A request of a copy of the personal information we keep about you, depending on the laws of your country, must be made in writing giving details with which Ganz can identify you. Information will be furnished in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p>Personal information provided by email may not be secure, and by requesting a copy of your child’s personal information, you assume the risks associated with the email transmission of our reply.&nbsp; In the event that Ganz may, consistent with applicable law, decline to provide you or your parent or guardian with the information requested, and we choose to so decline, we will provide the reason why.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You can ask privacy questions.</strong> <strong></strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about Ganz’s Privacy Policy, want to advise us how you would like your and/or your child’s personal information not to be used or disclosed, or would like to access or update your personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacyofficer@ganz.com"><span style="color: #0000ff;">privacyofficer@ganz.com</span></a> from your (parent’s) email.
