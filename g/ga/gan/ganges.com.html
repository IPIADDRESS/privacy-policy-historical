In the same manner, we may also engage third parties to monitor the usage of Ganges Service.

We may collect personally identifiable information from you when you seek access to certain portions of Ganges Service, publish or download content, and/or register for our services. This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, physical and e-mail addresses, phone and/or fax numbers, Internet address, type of computer and credit card or other payment information, as well as your preferences and usage patterns. This information may be used to fulfill your requests for services, to communicate with you about your account, to support your online activities, to respond to your questions, to customize your experience and to customize the content or features of Ganges Service.

	Ganges is committed to taking appropriate measures to protect your privacy against unauthorized disclosures. Ganges uses a variety of secure techniques designed to protect your information.<br><br>
While we have implemented safeguards, you should be aware that Internet security technology rapidly changes.
