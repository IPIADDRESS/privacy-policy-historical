Once&nbsp; your  child has logged into the Service, we track your child's activities  by&nbsp; using logs of database transactions and server  interactions. We also use this&nbsp; information to understand which  areas of our Service are most appealing or&nbsp; least appealing  and to deliver content that is specific to your country or  area&nbsp; of residence. The Service may also use cookies, which are  pieces of information&nbsp; that the Service sends to your child's  computer while he or she is viewing the&nbsp; Service. Cookies  provide information to the Service so that the Service will&nbsp;  remember the user. These technical methods may involve the transmission  of&nbsp; information either directly to us or to our third party  service providers who&nbsp; are subject to the protections described  in this Privacy Policy. None of the&nbsp; information collected  through these methods is connected to or associated with&nbsp; any  other information about your child.<span style="color: black;">  </span></span></ol>&nbsp; <ol>-  <strong><span style="font-family: Arial , sans-serif;font-size: 9.0pt;">Email Communication from  You:</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial , sans-serif;font-size: 9.0pt;">&nbsp; If your child contacts us by  email or enters&nbsp; an email address when participating in a  contest, we use the email address only&nbsp; to respond one time to  your child's specific request and, if legally&nbsp; permissible, to  notify them if they won a contest. </span></ol>&nbsp;  <ol>- <strong><span style="font-family: Arial , sans-serif;font-size: 9.0pt;">Mail Communication from You:&nbsp;  </span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial , sans-serif;font-size: 9.0pt;">If your child wants to&nbsp;  contact us by mail, and the Service provides a submission form for  such&nbsp; communication, you may do so using such submission form.  The submission form&nbsp; may ask for your child's user name and  name of his or her game character, and&nbsp; your (the parent's)  name and signature.</span></ol>&nbsp; <ol>-  <strong><span style="font-family: Arial , sans-serif;font-size: 9.0pt;">Chatting on the Service</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial , sans-serif;font-size: 9.0pt;">.&nbsp;  When using scripted chat on any of the Service,&nbsp; members  select pre-constructed messages from chat menus. Members CANNOT type  in&nbsp; their own messages, and no personal information can be  disclosed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the restricted chat mode,  messages are&nbsp; limited to words from our restricted dictionary,  which is designed to prevent&nbsp; minors from including any  personal information such as numbers, common proper&nbsp; names and  place names.&nbsp; Some areas of the&nbsp; Service may offer  unrestricted chat â such chat is suitable to adults but is&nbsp; not  to be used by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly  permit&nbsp; preteens to use unrestricted chat.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Please note that, in some instances, users relying on scripted chat  may&nbsp; view messages posted by users relying on the restricted  and/or unrestricted&nbsp; mode of chat.
