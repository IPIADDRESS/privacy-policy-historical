We use your assigned access level to deliver content specific to your interests or position. </p>
<p>Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address). We use this contact information from the registration form to verify your status as a teacher or school district employee and affiliation with a particular school, district, or educational institution. This is done to protect the safety of our users.  We at Gaggle want to provide safe, controlled e-mail account for students and teachers.  The customer's registration information is also used to contact the user with information about our company and updates to the Gaggle E-mail Service.</p>
