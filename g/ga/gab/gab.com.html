        We are committed to protecting your privacy. We created this Gab Online, LLC Privacy Policy (this "Privacy Policy") to describe our information collection and use practices in connection with our online services and mobile applications (the "Service"), which is made available to you through a variety of platforms, such as through gab.com (the "Website"), through Facebook, and other social media (collectively, "Social Media"), and through cell phones, personal digital assistants, and other mobile devices (collectively, the "Mobile Devices"). The Website, our Social Media pages, and the Mobile Devices are collectively referred to as the "Platforms." "Gab," "we," "us," and "our" refers to Gab Online, LLC, the company that owns and operates this Website.</p><p>
        By visiting our Website, and/or using our Service on any of the Platforms, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use.</p><h3>Information we collect</h3><p>
        We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like what you like to do, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful or the people whose opinions matter most to you online.</p><p>
        We collect information in two ways:</p><p><strong>Information you give us.</strong></p><p>
        When you visit our Website and use our Service, you may provide us with personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, mailing address, personal interests, and other information (collectively, the "Personal Information"). We do not collect any Personal Information from you when you visit the Website unless you provide us with the Personal Information voluntarily (for example, by registering for an account, either directly through our Website or through Social Media).</p><p><strong>Information we get from your use of the Website and the Service.</strong></p><p>
        We may collect information about the Website, the Service and Platforms that you use and how you use them, like when you visit our Website or a website that uses our advertising services or you view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:</p><h3>Device information</h3><p>
        We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). We may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Gab Account or Facebook Account.</p><h3>Log information</h3>
        When you use our Platforms or view content provided by Gab, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include:
        <ul><li>details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.</li><li>telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls.</li><li>Internet protocol address.</li><li>Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.</li><li>cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.</li><li>Location information</li><li>When you use a location-enabled service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.</li></ul><h3>Local storage</h3><p>
        We may collect and store information (including Personal Information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.</p><h3>How we use and share information we collect</h3><p>
        We use the Personal Information, the geolocational information, and the other information (a) to provide you the Service, (b) to send you information about Gab or the Service, (c) to customize and tailor your experience on the Website, and (d) to provide you with content that we think you might be interested in and according to your preferences. We may also use your contact information to inform you about other products and services that may be available through Gab, and/or companies with which we have a marketing relationship, and to provide you a customer survey to assess your satisfaction with our Service.</p><h3>We may share Personal Information with third parties as described below:</h3><p>
        We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include providing marketing assistance and customer service. These other companies will have access to your Personal Information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law.</p><p>
        We will share your Personal Information to your friends and also at our discretion to a general feed.</p><p>
        As long as you have explicitly consented, we may from time to time share your Personal Information with the public and with other companies which may provide you with information about the products and services they offer. However, you will have the opportunity to stop this sharing by giving a notice of objection at any time. Please send the notice to: support@gab.com.</p><p>
        To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose Personal Information when required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency, or whenever we believe that disclosing the Personal Information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of Gab or others.</p><p>
        We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business affiliates and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p><p>
        If Gab is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we expect that the Personal Information would be transferred along with the other business assets.&nbsp; If such a transaction occurs, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any Personal Information and give affected users notice before Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.&nbsp;</p><h3>Information you share</h3><p>
        Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines. Our Services and Platforms provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content.</p><p>
        If you choose to post user-generated content on the Website or any of our other Platforms, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information included with your user-generated content can be read, collected, or used by other users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in your user-generated content.</p><h3>Accessing and modifying personal information and communication preferences</h3><p>
        You can review and manage the Personal Information that you have provided to us through the account settings on our Website, and you can remove or change any information in your profile or account at any time. In addition, you may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link located on the bottom of any Gab marketing e-mails. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a timely manner. You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our subscription databases. You cannot opt-out of receiving transactional e-mails related to your account with Gab.</p><h3>How we protect visitor information</h3><p>
        We strive to maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to secure Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We use industry-standard SSL ("Secure Socket Layer") encryption technology, a secure server, and other physical and procedural safeguards to protect the security of such information. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet.</p><p>
        If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us as described in the "How to Contact Us" section. We will investigate your question, respond to your inquiry, and attempt to resolve any concerns regarding your privacy question.</p><h3>Enforcement</h3><p>
        We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.</p><h3>Changes</h3><p>
        Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.</p><h3>External web sites</h3><p>
        The Website may contain links to third-party web sites. Gab has no control over the privacy practices or the content of any of our business affiliates, advertisers, sponsors, or other web sites to which we provide links from the Website and the Service. As such, Gab is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of web sites to which our Website or Service may link. You should check the applicable privacy policy of the web site sponsor when visiting any other web sites.</p><h3>Changes to this privacy policy</h3><p>
        This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date stated at the top of this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. By accessing the Service and the Website or providing us Personal Information after we make any such changes to this Privacy Policy, you are deemed to have accepted such changes. Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis.</p><h3>How to contact us</h3><p>
        If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact Gab via e-mail at support@gab.com with "PRIVACY POLICY" in the subject line.</p></article></div><div class="bottom-cta"><span>Curious what <strong>your friends</strong> are Gabbing about?</span><a class="btn btn-blue btn-large btn-glow" href="https://api.singly.com/v0/oauth/authenticate?service=facebook&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gab.com%2Fsingly%2Fcallback%2F&amp;scope=email%2Cuser_likes%2Cuser_location%2Cuser_status%2Cpublish_stream&amp;client_id=d4301d1668c1a10287b2c5c0c1007ada" onclick="_kmq.push(['record', 'FB-login-1', {}]);F.connectLoading('The Facebook login will open up shortly, please follow the instructions to sign in.');"><div class="sprite ico_fb_lg"></div>
