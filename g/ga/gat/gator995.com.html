Information Collected  </h3><p data-reactid="333">	2.1	We collect information that you provide directly to us.  You may provide different types of Personal Information to us when you engage in certain Website(s) activities, such as creating an account, ordering a product or service, submitting, posting or accessing various content or features, subscribing to mobile push notifications, responding to and submitting a form, participating in our blogs or forums, entering a sweepstakes, contest, promotion or other special initiative, signing up for a special offer, completing a survey, sending feedback, requesting or submitting information, applying for a job, or directly contacting us.  It is optional for you to engage in such activity, however, if you choose to do so, we may require that you provide us certain Personal Information.  Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is required and some is voluntary.  If you do not provide required information for a particular activity, you may not be permitted to engage in that activity. We also ask that you not send us, and that you not share, any sensitive Personal Information, for example, social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background and/or trade union membership.</p><p data-reactid="334">2.2	We may also collect certain information automatically, we may collect data that is not linked but may be linkable to an individual or to a particular device (such as “hashed” email addresses or usernames so as to be non-identifiable, and demographic information such as gender, age or income when not tied to PII), and location data that describes the precise geographic location of a device.  This information may be collected through various technologies, including through use of cookies, web beacons and other technologies, and may include the following:  your browser and mobile phone, tablet or other device type, operating system and name of your Internet service provider; web pages you visit on the Website(s); IP address, browser type, profile information, geo-location information; information about your interactions with email messages, such as whether the messages were opened and the links clicked in those emails; and standard server log information. 	</p><p data-reactid="335">2.3	We collect email lists.  When you use the Website(s), you may be given the option to subscribe to or to be added to our subscription or email list. Whether or not you select either option, your Personal Information may be shared with third parties consistent with this Privacy Policy. Subscriptions to the email list can be cancelled at any time. </p><p data-reactid="336">2.4	We collect Information provided when you set up your account/become a registered user.  You may have the opportunity to create account(s) on the Website(s), which may include a shopping account with us. A shopping account may allow you to shop faster and easier, check on order status and history, entering contests and participating in promotions and surveys, posting comments, participating in special features on the Website(s) and to use certain other features of the Website(s). Using your email and password of your choice, you may access your account online at any time to add, delete, or change information. The Personal Information provided by you is not used for any purpose other than as outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you ever use a public computer to access the Website(s) account, we strongly encourage you to log out at the conclusion of your session. By doing so, although your information may still be stored with us, it should not be accessible to anyone else from that computer.  </p><p data-reactid="337">2.5	We collect information provided by registered users.  In creating an account, you authorize us to store your name, address, email address, telephone number and other Personal Information that you may provide.  With the exception of email addresses, physical address and cell phone numbers, registered users’ voluntary personal profile information, including pictures, are displayed to other registered users in order to facilitate user interaction.  Registered users’ user names are displayed to all users, although each verified user has the option of having his or her full name displayed to all users instead of his or her user name.  We therefore encourage you to choose a user name that is not your actual name. We take steps to protect against our revealing email addresses, physical addresses or cell phone numbers directly to other users or disclosing such information to third parties other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  </p><p data-reactid="338">2.6	Payment processing information is not collected by us.
