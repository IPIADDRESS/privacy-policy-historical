        </b> </font></p>
      <p>This web site is operated by The Quaker Oats Company. We recognize that 
        many visitors to our site are concerned about the information they provide 
        to us, and how we treat that information. Our goal at Quaker is to provide 
        safe entertainment and education for you and your kids. Please read on 
        to learn about our Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p><font size="4"><b>Gathering and Use of Information</b></font><b><br>
        </b>Any personal information collected by Quaker on any of its sites will 
        be used only for internal Quaker use and will not be sold or provided 
        to third parties. Some Quaker sites may collect non-personal information 
        (in the form of aggregated statistics) from you by using "cookie" technology. 
        This information is used internally to better provide services to our 
        consumers. As with the personal information, we do not provide or sell 
        any of these aggregated statistics to any third parties. We will not send 
        you any e-mail unless you ask to be added to our update lists or ask for 
        information from us. If you want to remove your or your childÕs e-mail 
        address from our files, please let us know. Since the information you 
        submit to us may not be encrypted, we cannot guarantee the absolute privacy 
        of that information.</p>
      <p> <b><font size="4">Kids and Parents</font><br>
        </b><b>Kids </b>- If you are 18 years of age or younger, please be sure 
        to ask your parents for permission before providing any information to 
        us.</p>
      <p><b>Parents -</b> We hope that you and your kids enjoy our web site. In 
        communicating directly with minors over the Internet, we recognize the 
        unique issues raised regarding the protection of your kids' privacy. The 
        Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU), a section of The Better Business 
        Bureau, has issued guidelines for web sites gathering information from 
        minors. Quaker intends to comply with the CARU guidelines in order to 
        protect your kids and their privacy. On Quaker sites which communicate 
        with kids, we include several notices asking kids to get parental permission 
        before providing any personal information.</p>
      <p><b><font size="4">Links</font></b><br>
        Quaker's site may contain "links" to other sites, and we make 
        every effort to only link to sites that share our high standards of decency, 
        fairness, and integrity. We try our best to ensure that these links are 
        safe for kids. However, since we cannot guarantee the content of every 
        site to which we are linked, kids should always check with an adult before 
        linking to any new sites.</p>
      <p> <b><font size="4">Your Ideas</font></b><br>
        We encourage you to share your comments and questions with us. We promise 
        to read all the mail you send to us, but we may not be able to respond 
        to all of it. However, please note that we assume no responsibility for 
        reviewing unsolicited ideas for our business (like product or advertising 
        ideas) and will not incur any liability as a result of any similarities 
        between your ideas and future Quaker products or programs. This means 
        that we have no obligation to treat your idea submissions confidentially 
        and that we can use them without paying you for them. Any and all idea 
        submissions will be owned by Quaker exclusively and may be used by Quaker 
        for any purpose, now or in the future.</p>
