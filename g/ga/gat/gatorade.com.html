        <br>
        The Quaker Oats Company, maker of Gatorade thirst quencher, is committed 
        to protecting your personal privacy. We provide this notice to explain 
        the type of information that is collected at our <a href="../index.html">http://www.Gatorade.com</a> 
        web site, including the information which is collected by our Merchandising 
        Agents (Promotion Fulfillment, Inc., and Eye Level Solutions, Inc.) who 
        manage the on-line Gatorade store. This policy also explains the choices 
        that you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 
        Our privacy policy is available to you to review on our homepage and at 
        every site where we have requested personally identifiable information. 
      </p><p class="content"><font color="#FF9900"><b>The Information We Collect</b></font><br>
        <br>
        This policy applies to all information submitted to this Web site. You 
        may be asked to provide personal information so that we can respond to 
        your request for information or your feedback to us, or so that you can 
        order a product, facilitate payment, and be shipped a product to a location 
        you specify. We will not require you to provide more information than 
        is necessary to participate in any of our site activities. When you provide 
        your personal information such as name, address, e-mail address, daytime 
        phone number, and age, Quaker and any of the third party Merchandising 
        Agents (who Quaker has retained to manage the store and provide you with 
        the products and services offered on the Site), will not give or sell 
        this information to any outside company for any use.
		
		<br><br>
        When you place an order for product you will be asked for certain information 
        required for processing the order. The secure processing of credit card 
        information is done by Promotion Fulfillment, Inc. Only your shipping 
        information is forwarded by Promotion Fulfillment to Eye Level Solutions, 
        Inc. to ship your order. Operation of the <a href="../index.html">www.Gatorade.com</a> 
        site, however, is solely within the control of Quaker. 
		
		<br><br></p><p class="content"><font color="#FF9900"><b>Order Offline</b></font><br><br> Although 
        we employ the safest data encryption methods possible, if for any reason 
        you would like to place your order offline, you may reach us by calling 
        1-800-88-GATOR or 1-800-884-2867 and a customer service agent will take 
        your order and payment information over the phone.
