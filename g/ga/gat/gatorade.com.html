    <h6>Our Commitment to Privacy</h6>
    <p>The Quaker Oats Company, maker of Gatorade thirst quencher, is committed to protecting your personal privacy. We provide this notice to explain the type of information that is collected at our http://www.Gatorade.com web site, including the information which is collected by our Merchandising Agents (Promotion Fulfillment, Inc., and Eye Level Solutions, Inc.) who manage the on-line Gatorade store. This policy also explains the choices that you can make about the way your information is collected and used. Our privacy policy is available to you to review on our homepage and at every site where we have requested personally identifiable information.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6>The Information We Collect</h6>
    <p>This policy applies to all information submitted to this Web site. You may be asked to provide personal information so that we can respond to your request for information or your feedback to us, or so that you can order a product, facilitate payment, and be shipped a product to a location you specify. We will not require you to provide more information than is necessary to participate in any of our site activities. When you provide your personal information such as name, address, e-mail address, daytime phone number, and age, Quaker and any of the third party Merchandising Agents (who Quaker has retained to manage the store and provide you with the products and services offered on the Site), will not give or sell this information to any outside company for any use.</p>

    <br>
