<p>We collect information about your device and Internet usage. If you download our application, we may collect information from your phone, like your UDID. We may also collect information about the parts of our app you use or third party apps or websites you visit when you leave our own. We may work with third parties who collect information about you when you use our apps.</p>
<p>Demographic information. We might also ask for information like your gender and age.</p>
<p>Depending on the features you use, we may collect information about your location. When accessing a site or application from a mobile device, we might use cellular tower information to identify your approximate location.

<p>Other information. If you use our websites, we may collect information about the browser you are using. We might track the pages you visit. We might look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us. We collect this information using the tracking tools described here. To control those tools, please read below.</p>
<h2>WE COLLECT INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM YOU, FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND PASSIVELY.</h2>
<p>We collect information directly from you. We might collect information from you when you submit content, post comment, or submit sports and physical activity information.</p>
<p>We collect information from you passively. We (or vendors acting on our behalf) use common collection techniques. For example, we might use digital fingerprinting, browser cookies or web beacons.

<p>We use your information for marketing purposes. For example, if we have your contact information, we might send you marketing messages. Third parties we work with may use your UDID to help us serve you with ads targeted to your interests. As otherwise permitted by law.</p>
<h2>WE MAY SHARE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES.</h2>
<p>If we think we have to in order to comply with the law. For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena. We may also share if a government agency requests. We may also share if an investigatory body requests.</p>
