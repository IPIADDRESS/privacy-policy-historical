This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a <strong>“Device”</strong>) whenever you visit or interact with our Service. To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat it as Personal Information This Usage Information may include:</p>
<ul>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tracking Technologies. </strong> We may use various methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (<strong>“Tracking Technologies”</strong>). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device. A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Service. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our Service’s pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Embedded Scripts. </strong> An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Browser Fingerprinting.</strong> Collection and analysis of information from your Device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>ETag, or Entity Tag. </strong> A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Recognition Technologies.</strong> Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Location-identifying Technologies.</strong> Additionally, the Service may use GPS (global positioning systems) software and other location-based technologies to locate you so we may verify your location and deliver you relevant content based on your location.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>In-app Tracking Methods.</strong> There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifiers such as “Ad IDs” to associate app user activity to a particular app.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Service.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tracking Technologies Usage.</strong> We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Strictly Necessary. </strong> We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our Service, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of shopping cart functionality.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Performance Related.</strong> We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Service, including as part of our analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered through the Service.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Functionality Related. </strong> We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are required to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing the Service, including identifying you when you sign in to our Service or keeping track of our specified preferences, including in terms of the presentation of content on our Service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Targeting Related. </strong> We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on our Service and third party sites based on how you interact with advertisements or content. This includes using Tracking Technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the content that has been delivered to you. Further information on this, and your opt-out choices, is found in <a href="#section6">Section 6</a> and <a href="#section7">Section 7</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tracking Technologies Choices and Consent.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are giving you detailed notice of the Tracking Technologies and your limited choices regarding them so that your consent is meaningfully informed. For more information on your choices regarding Tracking Technologies, see <a href="#section6">Section 6 </a>and <a href="#section7">Section 7 </a>below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Third Party Tracking and Do Not Track.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Third parties may use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Service, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms known as “do not track signals”. For instance, some browsers may have such signal options, though they differ as to if the signal is set as default or must be turned on by the user. Further, there is not yet an industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms, though we may consider doing so if an understandable and practical standard is developed and widely adopted.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com."></a><strong> (c) Information Third Parties Provide About You</strong></p>
<p id="section1c" style="text-align: justify;">We may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Service, such as when they submit content to us or post on the Service. Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Service with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. To the extent we combine information we receive from those sources with your Personal Information we collect on the Service, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise. In no other circumstances do our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.</p>
<p id="section1d" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(d) Third-Party Content and Services</strong></p>
<p>The Service may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and a third-party web site, platform, tool, application or other service, and/or accessing or display of third-party content via the Service (<strong>“Third Party Services”</strong>). The use of Third Party Services may involve the third-party operator thereof (<strong>“Third Party Operator”</strong>) providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us. For example, when you register with the Service, you may have an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account provided by a third-party site or application to facilitate the registration and log-in or transaction process on the Service, or otherwise link accounts.</p>
<p>If we offer and you choose to use Third Party Services to access or use our Service, the Third Party Services may send Personal Information about you to us. To the extent we combine such third-party sourced information with Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. If we discontinue use of any Third Party Service (e.g., your Facebook or any other account as an access mechanism for the Service), you consent that we may nevertheless retain any Personal Information, and other information and data, we may have already received in connection therewith in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>In addition, we may provide Third Party Services’ interfaces or links on the Service to facilitate your sending a communication from the Service. For example, we may use third parties to facilitate e-mails, tweets, “likes,” content submissions or postings of comments on Facebook or other social media platforms. We may also enable access to or display of third party content via the Service, that is actually being served or published by the third party, and such third party may be collecting data from you in connection with that content. These third parties may collect and retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>When you use Third Party Services, you are using their services and not our Service and they, not we, are responsible for their practices. You should review the applicable third party privacy policies before using such Third Party Services in connection with our Service. For more information on Third Party Services and the policies and activities of Third Party Operators see <a href="#section5">Section 5</a>.</p>

<p id="section5"><strong>5. Do Third-Party Content, Links To Third-Party Sites, and/or Third-Party Apps Appear on the Service?</strong></p>
<p>The Service may contain content that is supplied by a Third Party Operator, and those third parties may collect Usage Information and your Device Identifier when such content is served to you. Third Party Services may also be available via the Service. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by such third parties or their services and they may be collecting data about you and may be sharing it with us and/or others. These third parties and their services may also associate their Tracking Technologies with you, track you across sites and time, serve you their own ads (including Interest-based Ads (defined below)) and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.</p>
<p>In addition, when you are on the Service you may be directed to other services that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control.

<p id="section6"><strong>6. Are Ads Served On the Service or Retargeted to Me Later?</strong></p>
<p>The Center may engage and work with third parties to serve advertisements on The Center’s behalf on the Service, and/or on Third Party Services, and to provide analytics about the use of the Service and the performance of The Center’s ads and content on the Service and on Third Party Services. In addition, The Center may participate in online advertising networks and exchanges that display relevant advertisements to The Center visitors, on the Service and on Third Party Services, based on user interests as reflected in their use of the Service and certain Third Party Services. These entities may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to automatically collect information about you and your activities, such as registering a unique identifier for your device and tying that to your online activities on and off of the Service. The Center may use this information to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on the Service and Third Party Services and better understand your online activity.</p>
<p>Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third Party Services may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by The Center and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant and retargeted ads (“Interest-based Ads”) and/or other content to you on the Service and certain Third Party Services. You may have certain choices regarding these activities as explained in the next section.</p>
<p>The Center is not responsible for third parties or Third Party Services associated with advertising and analytics services, and related tracking activities.

<p id="section7"><strong>7. How Do I Exercise Choice and Change Preferences?</strong></p>
<p id="section7a"><strong>(a) Accessing And Changing Information.</strong></p>
<p>The Service may provide web pages or other mechanisms allowing you to delete, correct or update some of the Personal Information you have provided The Center. The Center will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in The Center’s then-active databases as soon as practicable, but it is not always possible to completely change, remove or delete all of your information or public postings from The Center’s databases and residual and/or cached data may remain archived thereafter. Further, we reserve the right to retain data (i) as required by applicable law; and (ii) for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data is retained as permitted by applicable law (e.g., business records).</p>
<p id="section7b"><strong>(b) Tracking Technologies Generally.</strong></p>
<p>Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies or other Tracking Technologies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s website <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html.">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html.</a> Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</p>
<p>App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can be disabled by uninstalling our apps. To uninstall our apps, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer. In addition, you may have certain choices regarding in-app Interest-based Advertising as described in the next section.</p>
<p>Some third parties may also offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies. One way to potentially identify cookies on our Site is to add the free Ghostery plug-in to your browser (<a href="https://www.ghostery.com/">www.ghostery.com</a>), which according to Ghostery will display for you traditional, browser-based cookies associated with the web sites (but not mobile apps) you visit and privacy and opt-out policies and options of the parties operating those cookies. The Center is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this tool or third party choice notices or mechanisms. For specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party analytics and advertising providers, see the next section.</p>
<p id="section7c"><strong>(c) Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising.</strong></p>
<p>The Center may use Google Analytics or other Service Providers for analytics services. These analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help The Center analyze how users use the Service. Information generated by these services (e.g., your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by Google Analytics and other Service Providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these Service Providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Service, compiling statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and providing other services relating to Service activity and other Internet usage. The Center only retains aggregated data from Google Analytics. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a> or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.</p>
<p>Certain companies may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (<strong>"DAA"</strong>) AdChoices Program and may display an Advertising Option Icon for Interest-based Ads that links to an opt-out tool which allows you to exercise certain choices regarding targeting. You can learn more about the DAA AdChoices Program at <a href="http://www.youradchoices.com/">http://www.youradchoices.com/</a> and its opt-out program for mobile apps at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices.">http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices.</a> In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (<strong>“NAI”</strong>). NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of certain Interest-based Ads delivered by NAI members' ad networks. To learn more about opting out of such targeted advertising or to use the NAI tool, see <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.</a> Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Ads, you will continue to receive non-targeted ads. Further, opting out of one or more NAI or DAA members only means that those selected members should no longer under the DAA / NAI rules deliver certain targeted ads to you. This will affect this and other services, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or web browser(s), or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Mobile device opt-outs will not affect browser-based Interest-based Ads even on the same device, and you must opt-out separately for each device. The Center is not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. However, The Center supports the ad industry’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising</strong></span> (<a href="http://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf">http://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf</a>) and expect that ad networks The Center directly engages to serve you Interest-based Ads will do so as well, though The Center cannot guaranty their compliance.</p>
<p id="section7d"><strong>(d) Mobile Apps.</strong></p>
<p>With respect to The Center’s apps, you can stop all collection of information by uninstalling the app. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device. See also the prior section regarding in-app Interest-based Ads choices.</p>
<p id="section7e"><strong>(e) Communications and Marketing.</strong></p>
<p>You can opt out of receiving certain promotional communications (e-mails or text messaging) from The Center at any time by (i) for promotional e-mails, by following the instructions as provided in e-mails to click on the unsubscribe link, or if available by changing your communication preferences by logging onto your account; and (ii) for text messages, by following the instructions as provided in text messages from The Center to text the word, “STOP”. Please note that your opt-out is limited to the e-mail address or phone number used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions. If you opt-out of only certain communications, other subscriptions may continue. Even if you opt out of receiving promotional communications, The Center may, subject to applicable law, continue to send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, transactions, servicing, or The Center’s ongoing business relations. In addition, you may opt-out of our future sharing of your personal information with third parties as part of a cooperative database with those third parties and for those third parties’ direct marketing and/or charitable purposes by e-mailing us <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#99faf6f4e9f5f0f8f7fafcf6fffff0fafcd9f5f8f5fefbedfafcf7edfcebb7f6ebfe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> or writing to us at Los Angeles LGBT Center, McDonald/Wright Building, 1625 N Schrader Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90028-6213, Attn: Compliance Officer.</p>
