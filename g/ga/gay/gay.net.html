							<h4 id="disclosure">When Gay.com Discloses Information </h4>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>Gay.com does not share your personal information with other organizations for their own marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent. Please be aware, however, that any personal information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the Gay.com Service - such as when you publish content, comments or profile information - becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others. </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>If you connect to a third party service (such as Facebook or Twitter) through an icon or link on the Gay.com Service or otherwise link your Gay.com account with a third party service, we may share the contents of your post and associated information (such as your user name, the fact that your connection originated from the Gay.com Service, and other relevant usage and diagnostic information) with such third party.&nbsp; With your one-time consent, we may also send information about the content you watch and your activities on the Gay.com Service to such third parties. Once such information is shared, the use of your information will be subject to that service's privacy policy and this Privacy Policy will not apply. </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Gay.com may disclose Automatically Collected and other aggregate non-personal information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, or other functionality of Gay.com. </p>
								</li>

We require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize them to use the information only for the purposes for which it is provided to them, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures. </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Gay.com may disclose User information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with US state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or other applicable laws around the world (for example, in the country of your residence); or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner legally required by the requesting entity. </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Gay.com also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith and after making reasonable enquiries, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability to Gay.com; protect Gay.com from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations to protect the security or integrity of the Gay.com Service; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Gay.com, our Users, or others.

							<h4 id="choices">Your Choices </h4>

							<h4 id="advertisers"> Advertisers and Analytics Providers </h4>
							<p> We may use third-party Web analytics services on our site, such as those of Google Analytics and Mixpanel.&nbsp; These service providers use a variety of tracking technologies such as cookies to analyze how users use the Gay.com Service.&nbsp; The information collected will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Gay.com Service.&nbsp; To learn about opting out of Google Analytics, please&nbsp; <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">click here</a>. To opt out of Mixpanel, please <a href="https://mixpanel.com/optout" target="_blank">click here</a>. Because these opt outs are cookie-based, please note that if you get a new computer or device, install a new browser, or erase or alter your browser's cookie file, you may need to opt out again. </p>
							<p>Gay.com may allow advertisers, third-party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you within the Gay.com Service and other Gay.com sites, services and software. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements, and to collect and track information such as demographic information, inferred interests, aggregated information, and activity to assist them in personalizing the advertising content delivered to you. Gay.com does not provide your personal information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Gay.com to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, males age 25 to 30) or audience segment (for example, males age 25 to 30 who have participated in certain promotions) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach. </p>
							<p> This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of, those other advertisers, third-party advertising networks, or third-party advertising servers. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these advertisers, third-party advertising networks, or third-party advertising servers. For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/consumers </a> , and to opt-out of such ad networks' and services' advertising practices, go to the&nbsp; <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/%29#completed" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative opt-out </a> page, the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out </a> page, or the <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices" target="_blank">Your Online Choices </a> page. </p>
							<p>Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. </p>

							<h4 id="security">Our Commitment to Data Security </h4>
							<p>Gay.com uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical measures designed to protect the integrity and security of your personal information.

							<h4 id="children">Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</h4>
							<p>IF YOU ARE UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE GAY.COM SERVICE AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. </p>
							<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Gay.com does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from persons under 18 years-of-age. If Gay.com learns that personal information of persons under 18-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Gay.com Service, Gay.com will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. </p>
							<p> If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 18 who has become a Gay.com Service member, then please contact Gay.com at <a href="mailto:privacy@gay.com">privacy@gay.com </a> to have that child's account terminated and information deleted. </p>
							<p>The following are some resources that may help parents and legal guardians in monitoring and limiting your children's' access to certain types of material on the Internet.
