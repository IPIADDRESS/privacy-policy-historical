<h1>Privacy Notice for Customers of the First Horizon and First Tennessee Family of 
	Companies
</h1>
<h2>Our Commitment to Your Privacy
</h2>
<p>We value your relationship with us, and we know that respect for your privacy is 
	the very foundation of that relationship. Since our company was founded in 
	1864, we have built a reputation based on trust. Advances in technology have 
	made safeguarding private information all the more important. We are committed 
       to safeguarding the information you share with us.</p>
<h2>About this Privacy Notice</h2>
<p>This notice describes our privacy policies, including how we collect, use and 
	safeguard customer information. It also explains how you can direct us not to 
	share or use certain types of information within our family of companies.
</p>
<h2>What Information is Covered by this Notice?
</h2>
<p>This notice applies to non-public personal information we collect about 
	individuals who obtain products or services from us that are to be used 
	primarily for personal, family or household purposes, including former 
	customers. We call this information "Customer Information".</p>
<h2>What Kinds of Customer Information Do We Collect?
</h2>
<p>We collect the following types of Customer Information:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Income, marital status, age, driver license and Social Security numbers and 
	other information from applications and other forms you complete and other 
	oral, written or electronic communications
	</li><li>
	Loan payment history, account balances and other information about transactions 
	you conduct with us, our affiliates, or others
	</li><li>
	Account information from other companies that you may ask us to maintain online 
	for you
	</li><li>
		Credit scores or credit histories from credit reporting agencies and other 
		information such as demographic information and insurance claims information we 
		receive from third parties
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Do We Share Customer Information with Outside Companies?
</h2>
<p>We do not share Customer Information with outside companies to use for their own 
	marketing purposes. Outside companies that provide us services (such as 
	printing or mailing) or help us provide you with products or services you 
	request (such as clearing brokerage transactions or underwriting insurance) 
       may receive Customer Information to help us provide you with these products 
       and services. We may also provide Customer Information to companies that perform 
	marketing services for us or to other financial institutions with which we have 
	joint marketing agreements. These companies help us provide you with a full range
       of financial products and services, and <strong>they are obligated to keep 
       Customer Information confidential.</strong> We also share Customer Information 
       with others when it is required or permitted by law, such as credit bureaus, 
       or to comply with subpoenas and summonses.</p>
<h2>Do We Use or Share Customer Information Within Our Family of Companies?
</h2>
<p>We use Customer Information about you and share it among the financial service 
	providers in our family of companies to help us provide you with our products 
       and service and to provide you with superior service and value. Sharing Customer 
	Information can <strong>save you time </strong>because you are not continually 
	supplying our affiliates with the same information. It can <strong>reduce the 
       amount of unwanted mail</strong> you receive because we send you only information 
       that may truly interest you. It also <strong>allows you to get the assistance you 
       need</strong> through our telephone service centers. Our internal financial service 
       providers, such as broker-dealers and insurance agents may use your Customer 
       Information to offer you products or services that could benefit you.
</p>
<h2>How Can You Limit Our Use of Customer Information About You?
</h2>
<p>Federal law gives you the right to limit how we use Customer Information about 
	you in two ways.
	</p><ol>
		<li>
		    <em><strong>The Affiliate Sharing Opt-out.</strong>
		    You may direct that Customer Information about you (other than transaction 
                  and experience information) not be shared among our family of companies.</em>
		</li><li>
		    <em><strong>The Affiliate Marketing Opt-out.</strong> You may direct that 
                  Customer Information about you shared among our family of companies not be 
                  used to market products and services to you.</em>
		</li>
	</ol>
<p></p>
<p><strong>If you choose either of these opt-out rights, we will treat it as if you 
	    have chosen both the Affiliate Sharing Opt-out <u>and</u> the Affiliate Marketing 
           Opt-out</strong>, and you may not receive information about products and services 
           that may interest you. If you have already exercised these opt-out rights, you do 
           not have to tell us again.
</p>
<p><strong>To exercise your opt-out rights, please call us at (877) 242-9880</strong>. 
	    When you call, someone will be able to answer your questions about privacy. 
           <strong>The opt-outs will remain in effect until you tell us otherwise</strong>.
</p>
<p>If you have a joint account, we will treat the exercise of your opt-out rights 
	as applying only to you unless you tell us that you are acting on behalf of the 
	other account holders. If your insurance policy names more than one person as 
	the insured parties, we will treat the exercise of your opt-out rights as 
	applying only to you unless you tell us that you are acting on behalf of the 
	other insured parties.
</p>
<h2>How Do We Protect Customer Information?</h2>
<p>Our employees have limited access to Customer Information. They have access only 
	when it will help you do business with us or help us do business with you. We 
	maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with 
	applicable laws and regulations to protect Customer Information.
</p>
<h2>What About Health Information?</h2>
<p>We may collect personally identifiable health information, like medical reports, 
	for certain products or services that we offer. We do not share personally 
	identifiable health information with anyone except as may be requested or 
	authorized by you or required in connection with processing a product or 
	service you have requested or as required or permitted by law.
</p>
<h2>What if Your Information is Not Correct?</h2>
<p>We have procedures in place to maintain accurate Customer Information. These 
	procedures include responding to requests to correct inaccurate Customer 
	Information. If you believe our customer records contain incorrect information 
	about you, call or write to us at the telephone number or address listed on 
	your account statement.
</p>
<h2>How Do We Keep You Up to Date on our Privacy Policies? 
</h2>
<p>We will provide you with a privacy notice each year as long as you have a 
	relationship with us. If we make material changes to our notice, we will let 
	you know. We will also post our updated privacy notice on our website, 
	www.firsttennessee.com. If you open another account or obtain another product 
       or service from another company within our family of companies, you may receive 
       another copy of this privacy notice. Certain customers may receive a separate notice 
       about specific privacy policies that may apply to their products or services. This 
       privacy notice was last updated in April 2009, and replaces any previous notices you 
       may have received about the privacy policies for our family of companies.
</p>
<h2>What If You Suspect Identity Theft?
</h2>
<p>If you are concerned that someone has unauthorized access to your personal 
	information, please call us immediately at (800) 382-5465 and select option "zero" 
       so we can take steps to help protect you. You should also report your concerns to:
</p>

	The Federal Trade Commission identity theft hotline at (877) ID-THEFT

	The Social Security Administration fraud hotline at (800) 269-0271
	</li><li>
	Your credit card companies. Remember, knowing where to find your credit card 
	information and toll-free contact numbers will help in an emergency.

</ul>

<h2>Special Notice for Vermont Residents
</h2>
<p>In order to comply with Vermont law, we will treat all accounts with a Vermont 
	mailing address as if you have requested that we not share your Customer 
	Information with another company in our family of companies and as if you 
	requested that our affiliates not use Customer Information to market their 
	products and services to you. In addition, if we provide Customer Information

	institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements, we will only
