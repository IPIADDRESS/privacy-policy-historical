	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><strong>Sharing and Disclosure of Information</strong></span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt">fTalk does not rent, sell, or share any information about the user with any third-parties. fTalk may disclose your Personal Information if fTalk believes such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on fTalk; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of fTalk (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of fTalk services or members of the public.</span></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. We operate our website in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We never knowingly collect or maintain information at or on our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is directed at or structured to attract anyone under 13.

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><strong>Security</strong></span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt">fTalk takes reasonable precaution to protect Personal Information from misuse, loss and unauthorized access. Although fTalk cannot guarantee that Personal Information will not be subject to unauthorized access, fTalk has physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the Personal Information.

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><strong>Changes to Policy</strong></span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt">From time to time, fTalk may revise this Policy. fTalk will post the revised Policy on the Site, so that users can always be aware of what information fTalk collects, how the information is used and under what circumstances such information may be disclosed.</span></p>
