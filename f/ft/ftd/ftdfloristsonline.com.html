        <b>Your Security and Privacy Are Important to Us<br>
  </b>Safe transactions and the protection of your privacy are of the utmost importance 
  to the FTD Florists Online Network. To help our customers understand our commitment 
  to security and privacy, we've outlined our policy in detail. <br>

  <b><a name="secure_shopping"></a>Secure Shopping</b> <br>
  Ordering from our network of FTD Florists Online is easy, convenient, and very 
  safe. The FTD Florists Online Network uses Thawte, a leading provider of Internet 
  protection services, including digital certification, to secure every transaction. 
  This software encrypts all the personal information that you send us (including 
  credit card numbers, names, addresses, and telephone numbers) so that your private 
  information cannot be read by anyone as it travels over the Internet. 
  <p>The FTD Florists Online Network also uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
    technology. SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that 
    information by anyone other than the FTD Florists Online Network.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <b><a name="account_protection"></a>Account Protection</b> <br>
    If you choose to open an account with any one of our FTD florist web sites, 
    your password will be your personal, secret entry code to the FTD Florists 
    Online Network for use with any of the sites you choose to shop with. The 
    passwords are encrypted on the database, and therefore cannot be read by anyone 
    who accesses this data. Your password is needed to access any account areas. 
    Your password keeps your account information private and secure. You can change 
    your password as many times as you like. <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <b><a name="collection"></a>Collection and Use of Information</b> <br>
    When you place an order, we require you to provide us with personal contact 
    and billing information, including your address and telephone number. We use 
    this information to give you a customized experience and to process the orders 
    that you place with us. <br>
    <br>
    When you place an order, your account information is saved only if you ask 
    us to save it. When you do our database stores your billing and delivery information 
    and automatically transfers it to the order form each time you place an order. 
    This way you do not have to re-enter this information each time you return 
    to order. <br>
    <br>
    If you open an account, you have access to an address book that includes addresses 
    and other contact information about persons to whom you have sent flowers 
    or gifts. You can view or edit information on your address book at any time. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Recipient information is used for delivery purposes. On some occasions, the 
    recipient may be called to schedule delivery. <br>
    <br>
    At the time of registering for an account, you also have the option to opt 
    in for our additional services, which include a personal date reminder service 
    and a free online address book. We use your contact information so that you 
    may take full advantage of these interactive tools. You have the option to 
    opt out of these additional services at any time. <br>
    <br>
    When you visit any of the FTD Florists Online web sites in our network, we 
    would like you to be aware of the fact that we do collect some basic non-identifying 
    information. This specifically includes information regarding your operating 
    system, browser software, and IP (Internet Protocol) address. This information 
    is collected in order to provide you with satisfactory service. We may use 
    the information to detect problems with our server and/or to aid in the administration 
    of our network of floral web sites. <br>

    Some of our floral web sites may contain links to other web sites. We are 
    not responsible for the privacy practices and content of these third-party 
    web sites. We urge you to follow safe Internet practices: Do not supply personal

    When making purchases with our network of FTD florist web sites your credit 
    card will be authorized and charged by each individual florist upon receipt 
    of the encrypted order information. FTD Florists Online does not validate, 
    authorize, or charge credit card information at any time. <br>
    <br>
    As always, consumers making purchases must have a valid credit card, be at 
    least 18 years of age or older, and have a good credit standing. <br>

    If you would like to edit or delete your account simply return to any of the

    you have signed in to your account a menu of options is provided for you to

    By shopping at any of our floral web sites or opening an account with our 
    network, you consent to the use of your personal information in the manner 
    specified in the privacy policy. We, however, have the option to change, modify, 
    or add to the terms and conditions of the privacy policy at any time. These 
    changes will be posted on the site to give you notice. Any customer who does 
    not agree to the altered privacy has the option to edit or delete their account.
