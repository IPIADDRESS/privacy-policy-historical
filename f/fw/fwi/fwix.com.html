            This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Fwix, Inc. (“Fwix”, “we” or “us”) with respect to your use of the Web site located at www.fwix.com (the “Site”) and the services offered on or through the Site (the "Fwix Service") so you can make an informed decision about using the Site and the Fwix Service.  We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated.  We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.

        <h3>What is personal information?</h3>
        <p>
            As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or credit card or other account number); information about that individual's location or activities, such as information about his or her use of the Site, when directly linked to personally identifiable information; and demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Site.  This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>What personal information do we collect?</h3>

We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information.  For example, we may collect your name, user name, address, location, email address, telephone number, and other contact and demographic information when you  register and set up an account, apply for a job, fill out a form, submit a comment, or contact us by e-mail or other means.  Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection creating a profile or group, leaving comments, posting content, sending an email or message to another user or participating in any interactive forums or features on the Site:  In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other activities on the Site.

If we link cookies to any personally identifying information, we will treat this information as personal information.  Web beacons (also know as clear gifs) are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Site or in emails relating to the Site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Site.
