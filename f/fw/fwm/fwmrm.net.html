This identifier can then be used in the advertising process. The cookies are valid for 1 year. These cookies may be deleted but will be re-set when the buyer is encountered again. The cookie contains an identifier set by the buyer’s system. Details of the cookies from our buying partners can be found on their websites.

<p>We are an application services provider, and host a software application that our customers access online. Although end users have a right to access their personal data collected by our customers, we have no direct business relationship with the end users of our customers. If you are a customer of one of our customer and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our Service, please direct your requests to our customer that you interact with directly. We will transfer personal data to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.</p>
<p>An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the FreeWheel’s customer (the data controller). If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>We also have no control over the content of the advertisement, including any cookies and web beacons set by advertisers on our customers’ Sites. Each customer understands that in the course of providing Services to it, we collect or receive information from the web browsers of individuals that are either visiting such customer’s web property or viewing content that is owned or displayed by such customer. This information includes frequency of ads delivered and other delivery statistics, time, browser type and version, visitor’s operating system, device type, referral URL, visitors’ IP addresses, visitors’ countries inferred from their IP addresses, and cookie data, including user IDs. We require our customers to obtain consent for our use of such information and we use it for our provision of Services and enforcement of our rights as described in the applicable customer contract, to improve our Services, and to compile aggregated statistics for internal or marketing purposes.</p>
<p>We do not possess or have access to information that could match IP addresses or user IDs to the identity of individuals. We do not allow visitor information collected and stored for one customer to be accessed by any other customer. Further, we may use and retain such information only as provided in its agreement with our customer. We require each of our customers to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations that are applicable to their use of our Services, and we promise each customer that we will do the same with respect to our provision of Services. We ask each customer to post a privacy policy that covers our Services and to maintain all necessary rights to allow us to provide the Services, including without limitation to receive the information that we collect and store on such customer’s behalf. We also require each customer to prevent personal data to be sent to us (other than IP addresses, device IDs and user IDs). An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to our applicable customer (the data controller) which has transferred such data to us for processing. If requested to remove data we will respond to such request within a reasonable timeframe..</p>
