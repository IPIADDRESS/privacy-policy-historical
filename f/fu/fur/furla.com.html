<br>
<br>
We use customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, promotions and contests.

<br>
Information We Collect by Automated Means<br>
<br>
We obtain certain information by automated means when you visit our website, such as the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet and the pages accessed.
