                              <p>Fuzing.com and Fuzing, Inc. (The legal owner and the operator of this site) treats an individual's privacy very seriously. Fuzing.com and Fuzing, Inc. are considered as one and the same legal person and are mentioned as Fuzing.com (or the Site) throughout this Privacy Policy Statement.</p>
                              <p>The services that Fuzing.com provides you with may require that we gather, process, use and distribute your member information which you provide by filling out our various forms and formats; for example, your company name, contact information, company profile and homepage and the products you buy and sell, etc. Therefore, Fuzing.com does not guarantee that your information will be protected from exposure to any particular party.

                                At the time you register to become a Registered User of the Site, you will be asked to fill out a registration form which requires you provide information such as your name, address, phone/fax number, email address and other personal information as well as information about your business (“Registration Information”). In the event that you decide to publish a product/service listing, or if you elect to have your own Fuzing site prefix (i.e. youcompany.fuzing.com) then much of your Registration Information will be published on our site and becomes "Publishing Information" (see next section).<br>
                                <br>
                                1.2 Publishing Information.<br>
                                If you submit any information to Fuzing.com to be published on the Site through the publishing tools, including but not limited to our Company Directory (Extended Profile), Trade/Product/Service Listings, then you are deemed to have given consent to the publication of such information (“Publishing Information”). Once you have elected to publish this information then much of your Registration Information becomes Publishing Information (notable exceptions: we will never publish your username, password or email address - nor will we ever publish Payment Information [see next section]).<br>
                                <br>
                                1.3 Payment Information.<br>
                                If you upgrade to a premium Fuzing service we collect additional information, including billing information, which may include credit card numbers and expiration dates (“Payment Information”). The security of your Payment Information is important to us. When you enter this information we encrypt it using Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL).<br>
                                <br>
                                1.4 Statistical Information.<br>
                                In addition, we gather aggregate statistical information about our Site and Users, such as IP addresses, browser software, operating system, pages viewed, number of sessions and unique visitors, etc. (“Statistical Information”). <br>
                                <br>

                                1.6 Registration Information, Publishing Information and Payment Information shall collectively be referred to as “Personal Identifying Information” because it may contain information that personally identifies you or your company.<br>

                              <p class="gheaderText">2. How We Use Information </p>

                                We use your Collected Information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our Site's content, layout and service specifically for you. <br>
                                We use your Collected Information to service your Account with us, including but not limited to investigating problems, resolving disputes and enforcing agreements with us.<br>
                                We share certain aggregate information based on analysis of Collected Information with our partners, customers, advertisers or potential Users. </p>
                              <p>2.2 Registration Information. <br>
                                We use your Registration Information to provide services that you request or to contact you regarding additional services about which Fuzing.com determines that you might be interested. <br>
                                Specifically, we use your email address, mailing address, phone number or fax number to contact you regarding notices, product alerts, and communications relevant to your use of our Site, if you choose to receive these as indicated at the time of registration. <br>

                                All of your Publishing Information will be publicly available on the Site and therefore accessible by any internet user.<br>

                                Any Publishing Information that you disclose to Fuzing.com becomes public information and you relinquish any proprietary rights (including but not limited to the rights of confidentiality and copyrights) in such information. <br>
                                <br>
                                You should exercise caution when deciding to include personal or proprietary information in the Publishing Information that you submit to us. <br>

Any credit card information that you provide through the Fuzing.com Site is directly submitted to a payment server of the credit card processing bank. “Quickbooks” will not use the payment information collected for any reasons other than to perform and validate the transaction.  
                                While “Quickbooks” has in place up-to-date technology and internal procedures to guard your Payment Information against intruders, there is no guarantee that such technology or procedure can eliminate all of the risks of theft, loss or mis-use. 
                                Fuzing.com shall not be liable to you or any other person for any damages that might result from unauthorized use, publication, disclosure or any other mis-use of Payment Information, including credit card information. <br>
                                <br>

                                We use Statistical Information to help diagnose problems with and maintain our computer servers, to manage our Site, and to enhance your Site and services based on the usage pattern data we receive. <br>
                                We generate reports and analysis based on the Statistical Information for internal analysis, monitoring and marketing decisions. 
                                We provide Statistical Information to third parties, but when we do so, we do not provide them any Personal Identifying Information.<br>

The promoting member has full control over the information that is being published and may change it at any time.<br>

                              <p>We use “cookies” to store specific information about you and track your visits to our Site. We also use the information that we store in cookies to link to your Personal Identifying Information. It is not uncommon for web sites to use cookies to enhance identification of their users. A “cookie” is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive.<br>

                                A cookie can be sent to your computer’s hard drive only if you access our Site using the computer. <br>
                                If you do not de-activate or erase the cookie, each time you use the same computer to access our Site, our web servers will be notified of your visit to our Site and in turn we have knowledge of your visit and the pattern of your usage.<br>

                                Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers, tracking utilities) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.<br>

                                Generally, we use cookies to identify you and enable us to access your Registration Information, Publishing Information or Payment Information so you do not have to re-enter it; gather statistical information about usage by Users; research visiting patters and help target advertisements based on User interests; assist our partners to track User visits to the Site and process orders; and track progress and participation in promotions.<br>
