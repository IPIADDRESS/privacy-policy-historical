                        Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Service <a href="https://www.fuze.com/href">https://www.fuze.com/extras/legal</a>. We collect the following types of information about you:
                    </p>
                    <p class="font16 fontHelveticaNeue">        
                        <span class="fontArialBold">Information you provide us directly:</span> We ask for certain information such as your username, first and last name, phone number, company and e-mail address when you register for a FuzeBox account, or if you correspond with us. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. Information we may receive from third parties: We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through LinkedIn or Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the FuzeBox application, linking your account to the FuzeBox Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to FuzeBox. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your LinkedIn UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. If you allow us access to your colleagues list, your colleagues’ user IDs, and your connection to those colleagues, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your colleagues to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your colleagues join FuzeBox. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the FuzeBox Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, we will remove the information collected about you in connection with that service.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font16 fontHelveticaNeue">
                        <span class="fontArialBold">Inviting a friend to use FuzeBox from the “Invite colleagues” feature:</span> If we provide and you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service through our “Invite colleagues” feature, you may directly choose a friend to invite through your mobile device’s native contact list – but we do not require that you import your contacts list to the Service, and we do not retain the information contained in your contacts list. You understand that by inviting a friend to FuzeBox through the “Invite colleagues” feature, you are directly sending a text or email from your personal accounts and that we are not storing your contact list. In addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent from your phone. Since this invitation is coming directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this communication.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font16 fontHelveticaNeue">
                        <span class="fontArialBold">Finding your colleagues on the Service:</span> If we provide and you choose, you can locate your colleagues with FuzeBox accounts through our “Find colleagues” feature. The “Find colleagues” feature allows you to choose to locate colleagues either through (i) your contact list, (ii) social media sites (such as LinkedIn) or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on FuzeBox. If you choose to find your colleagues through your contact list, then you agree to provide FuzeBox access to your contact list such that we can perform the search necessary to determine whether or not someone associated with the information you provide is using FuzeBox. If you choose to find your colleagues through social media sites, then you understand that the information these sites provide to use to conduct this type of search is governed by their privacy policies and your account settings on those sites. If you choose to find your colleagues through a search of names or usernames then simply type a name to search and see if that name or username appears on our Service. Note that we do not retain any information contained in your contacts list, or information from social media sites about your contacts, and we do not use such information for any purpose other than to help you find your colleagues on FuzeBox.

                        <span class="fontArialBold">Analytics information:</span> We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font16 fontHelveticaNeue">
                        <span class="fontArialBold">Cookies information:</span> When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets FuzeBox help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

                        <span class="fontArialBold">Log file information:</span> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
                    </p>

                        <span class="fontArialBold">Clear gifs/web beacons information:</span> When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
                    </p>

                        <span class="fontArialBold">Device identifiers:</span> When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by FuzeBox. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

                        <span class="fontArialBold">Location data:</span> When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.

                        <span class="fontArialBold">Commercial and marketing communications:</span> We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails. You will also be able to be “found” on FuzeBox based on information that you provide (see “Find colleagues on FuzeBox”) above.
