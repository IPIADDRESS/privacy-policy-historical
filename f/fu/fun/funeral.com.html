  <span style="font-family:Arial">Last Update:&nbsp; August, 2007 </span>
  <p></p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-family:Arial">Funeral.com, Inc. is committed to respecting
  your privacy and recognizing your need for appropriate protection and management
  of personal information you share with us (the phrase
  "personal information" means any information by which you can be
  identified, such as your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number,
  etc.). The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you what personal information
  we may collect from you, how we use such information, and the choices you have
  regarding our use of, and your ability to review and correct, the information.
  This policy applies only to customers in the United States.<br>
  <br>
  As a part of our commitment to your privacy, Funeral.com supports and adheres
  to the following guidelines and practices:&nbsp; we agree to (1) provide customers
  with notice of their ability to opt out of information rental, sale or exchange
  with other marketers; (2) honor customers' requests not to share their information
  with other marketers; and (3) honor customers' requests not to receive mail,
  telephone or other solicitations from Funeral.com.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Collecting Information About You</b></span><span style="font-family:Arial"><br>
  <br>
  There may be times (such as when you purchase or order a product, subscribe
  to a service, register to receive catalogs, or to participate in contests,
  sweepstakes or promotions, etc.) when we ask you to provide certain information
  about yourself, such as your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number,
  email address, credit card information, birth date, gender, occupation, personal
  interests, etc. We may also maintain a record of your product purchases.<br>
  <br>
  Whether or not to provide such information is completely your own choice. But
  if you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable
  to purchase products, or access certain services, offers and content on our
  web site. In addition, we may need to contact you via phone, email or mail
  to address questions or issues specific to your order, entry, etc., even if
  you have opted to not receive communications from us.<br>
  <br>
  In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you
  are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We may track the
  Internet domain address from which people visit us and analyze this data for
  trends and statistics, but individual users will remain anonymous, unless you
  voluntarily tell us who you are.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Using Information About You</b></span><span style="font-family:Arial"><br>
  <br>
  We use the personal information you provide for internal purposes, such as
  confirming and tracking your order, subscription or registration, analyzing
  trends and statistics, informing you of our new products, services and offers,
  and providing you with information from and about Funeral.com. From time to
  time we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities
  whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy
  policies are consistent with ours. These are known as our Select Partners.
  In such cases we might share and cross-reference information, including personal
  information about you that will enable such persons or entities to contact
  you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you.<br>
  <br>
  To serve you better, we may combine information you give us online, in our
  stores or through our catalogs. We may also combine that information with publicly
  available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with
  our Select Partners and others. We use that combined information to enhance
  and personalize your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about
  our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional
  purposes.<br>
  <br>
  We may contract with companies or persons to provide certain services including
  credit card processing, shipping, data management, promotional services, etc.
  We call them our Service Providers. We provide our Service Providers with the
  information needed for them to perform these services. We also ask our Service
  Providers to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours.<br>
  <br>
  Although unlikely, in certain instances we may disclose your personal information
  when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or
  bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to
  you, to Funeral.com or to others. We may also disclose your personal information
  when we believe the law requires it.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Editing, Updating, Correcting and Deleting Information About You</b></span><span style="font-family:Arial"><br>
  <br>
  We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you prefer
  not to receive information from any or all of the Funeral.com or from our Select
  Partners please let us know by sending an email to us through the website or
  writing to us at 2280 North Hamline Avenue, Roseville, Minnesota 55113. Please
  be sure to include your email address, mailing address, full name, and specifically
  what information you do not want to receive. If you would like to update or
  correct your email address, mailing address or other personal information with
  us please contact us the same way.<br>
  <br>
  Please note that any requests to remove or update your personal information
  may take up to ten (10) days for your email request and 6-8 weeks to process
  your postal mail request.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Protecting Children</b></span><span style="font-family:Arial"><br>
  <br>
  Funeral.com takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of children.
  Our web sites are general audience sites. We do not permit anyone under the
  age of 13 to register with us. We also do not send email correspondence to
  anyone who tells us that they are under the age of 13 without their parent's
  consent.<br>
  <br>
  Children under the age of 13 should always ask their parents or guardians for
  permission before providing any personal information to anyone online. We urge
  parents and guardians to participate in their children's online activities
  and use parental control or other web filtering technology to supervise children's
  access to the web.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Cookies</b></span><span style="font-family:Arial"><br>
  <br>
  Our web sites use "cookies." A cookie is a small amount of data that
  is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard
  drive. Generally, we use cookies to remind us of who you are, tailor our products
  and services to suit your personal interests, estimate our audience size, assist
  our online merchants to track visits to and sales at our sites and to process
  your order, track your status in our promotions, contests and sweepstakes,
  and/or analyze your visiting patterns. You can generally set your browser to
  not accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you
  the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Security</b></span><span style="font-family:Arial"><br>
  <br>
  We take precautions to protect the security of your personal information that
  you share with us. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet
  can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect
  your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any
  information you transmit to or from our web sites, and you do so at your own
  risk.<br>
  <br>
  We urge you to keep your password in a safe place and not to divulge it to
  anyone. Also remember to log off your account and close your browser window
  when you have finished your visit. This is to ensure that others cannot access
  your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or
  are using a computer in a public place such as a library or Internet cafe.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Links to Third Party Sites</b></span><span style="font-family:Arial"><br>
  <br>
  Our web sites may contain links to web sites operated and maintained by third
  parties, over which we have no control. Privacy policies on such linked sites
  may be different from our privacy policy. You access such linked sites at your
  own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a linked site before
  disclosing any personal information on such site.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Policy Changes</b></span><span style="font-family:Arial"><br>
  <br>
  If we decide to change our privacy policy, in whole or in part, we may do so
  at anytime without notice.&nbsp; Those changes will go into effect on the date
  posted in the notice. The new policy will apply to all current and past users
  of our web site and will replace any prior policies that are inconsistent.</span>
