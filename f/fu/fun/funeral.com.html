				<li><a href="http://obits.abqjournal.com/" title="&quot; BOUTZ — Brian Frederick Boutz passed away suddenly from a pulmonary embolism on Easter Sunday, 24 April 2011. Brian was born on 21 August 1972 at the Naval Hospital in Newport, Rhode Island. As a Navy Junior, Brian lived in Newport, Monterey California, Honolulu Hawaii, and Northern Virginia graduating from Robert E. Lee High School in Springfield, Virginia. After graduation, Brian ventured into the world and lived in South Carolina, Florida and California before settling in Colorado in 1997. He pursued a career as a photo technician, photographer, and ran a custom photo processing business. Brian was an avid outdoor enthusiast, who loved the beauty of both the sea and the mountains. His many interests included skateboarding, surfing, target shooting, 4-wheeling, and snowboarding. Brian had a life-long passion for music and played drums professionally in a local Denver area band. Brian’s love of cars led him to embark on a new career, completing work this semester on an Associate Degree in Automotive Science at Front Range Community College in Fort Collins, Colorado. He was planning to compete in sports car racing and was preparing his treasured Miata for the Spec Miata Class. Brian is survived by a blended family of his mother Rebecca D. Boutz and her husband Olin Allen and sister Lauren C. Boutz of Laporte, Colorado, and father Allen R. Boutz and his wife Betty Morris and brother Kimmer Franz of Springfield, Virginia. Brian is also survived by his Grandmothers, Mrs. William R. Boutz of Albuquerque, New Mexico and Mrs. Billy C. Daniels of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Brian wished to be an organ donor so that others might see and receive the gift of life. His remains were cremated and his ashes will be spread.

Brian was a gentle soul with a kind heart and will be greatly missed by his family and many friends, classmates and his beloved dog Riot.
