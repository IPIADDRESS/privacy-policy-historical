<p>The following webpage outlines funmanga’s collection and use of personal information from it’s users. funmanga.com values the privacy of our members and users, we will never share any personal information of anybody who logs on to funmanga with anyone. This includes your e-mail address, name, and location. Upon logging on to funmanga such things as your IP address and hostname are logged for statistical and security reasons.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a very small text file placed on your system upon logging on to funmanga (and most other websites). This file serves as your identification card and is uniquely yours, and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. Cookies tell us that you have returned to a specific web page on funmanga and help us track your preferences and transactional habits.

<h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
<p>Funmanga does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. We make reasonable efforts to prevent someone who is underage from joining as a member of funmanga, and will not collect information from them. If funmanga learns that a child under the age of 13 has become a member, we will close that child’s account and delete any information collected about the child.</p>
<p>Not withstanding the foregoing, funmanga may choose to retain some personal information such as the child’s e-mail address as a means to prevent the child from re-registering at our website. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) went into effect in April 2000, and as a result websites all over the world wide web had to change their standards to not collect any information from a child.</p>

This means that we may make disclosures that are necessary to conform to legal and regulatory requirements or processes and to protect the rights, safety, and property of funmanga, users of the funmanga website, and the public.</p>

We urge you to use a unique password with both letters and numbers to protect your account on funmanga and it’s affiliated websites. If others, including family, friends or other household members access and use the message board through your login credentials, you are responsible for the actions of that individual. Only in extreme cases will your account be fully terminated.</p>
<h3>Third Parties</h3>
