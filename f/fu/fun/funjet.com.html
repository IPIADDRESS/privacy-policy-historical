          important to Funjet Vacations. Funjet Vacations does not collect or maintain information from 
          our website from those known to be under 13 years of age. No part of our website is designed 
          to attract anyone under the age of 13. When online bookings are made, the ages of children traveling 
          with an adult are collected so that the appropriate hotel room and pricing can be chosen for 
          the reservation. The lowest age range specified on the guestbook sign up form is "18 and 
          under."</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

          information you submitted when you made an online reservation by viewing your password-protected 
          reservation. You will be asked to enter both your reservation number and your password. It is 
          the responsibility of the password holder to take reasonable precautions to protect his/her

          by others. </font></p>
