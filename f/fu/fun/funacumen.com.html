	            <h3>When Does KINGPLAY CORPORATION Collect Personal Information?</h3>
	            <p>KINGPLAY CORPORATION collects personal information from you when you voluntarily submit that information to KINGPLAY CORPORATION, for example: when you register on a Site; sign up for a subscription service; register for our e-newsletter service; participate in one of our sweepstakes, contests, or surveys; respond to an offer; purchase or rent products; or request to be on a mailing list. After you have registered your e-mail address on the Site and if you have clicked "Remember Me" or signed in to the Site, KINGPLAY CORPORATION collects Site behavior and browser information as you navigate through the Site. This information may be used to create a profile that we keep on individual Users that details their preferences, personal information and behavior. Consequently, collected information is tied to the User's personally identifiable information and may be used to provide offers and improve the content of the Site for the User. This profile may also be used to tailor a User's visit to our Web Site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them.</p>
         
	            <h3>What Happens When I Register On The Web Site?</h3>
	            <p>In order to use certain features of this Web Site, a User must first complete a registration process. During registration a User is required to provide basic contact information (such as name and e-mail address) and establish a password. Depending on the feature being used, the User may be required to provide other information associated with the use of that particular feature. For example, a User signing up for our subscription service will be required to provide an address for proof of location and financial information in the form of a credit card and expiration date for billing purposes,licensing porposes and future charges. Users signing up for our e-newsletter service may enter the types of games or games in which they are interested and about which they wish to receive information in the newsletter.</p>
           
	            <h3>What Happens When I Place An Order On The Web Site?</h3>
	            <p>Certain features of the Web Site do not require registration but may still require personal information to be entered, such as placing an order for a product. We request information from the User during the ordering process. For example, a User will be required to provide contact information (such as name, e-mail, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill Users' orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the User.</p>
            
	            <h3>Does KINGPLAY CORPORATION Use Cookie Technology?</h3>
	            <p>KINGPLAY CORPORATION uses cookie technology to make your use of the Sites more convenient and to support our internal business purposes. A cookie is a piece of information that is transferred to a User's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. For example, KINGPLAY CORPORATION uses cookies to remember your e-mail address so that you will not have to re-enter this information each time you visit the Site.

You may render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies. </p>
