Last Updated: January 2011</p>
<p>1. Purpose</p>
<p>FunTimesHad.com has adopted this Privacy Statement in order to inform you of its policies with respect to information collected from this website. Your use of this website constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Statement and your consent to the practices it describes.</p>
<p>2. Automatic Collection of Anonymous Information</p>
<p>When you visit FunTimesHad.com website, like when you visit most other websites, certain anonymous information about your visit is automatically logged, which may include information about the type of browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you access the internet (such as “aol.com” or “earthlink.net”), the date and time you access the site, the pages you access while at FunTimesHad.com’s website, and the internet address of the website, if any, from which you linked directly to FunTimesHad.com’s site. This information is not personally identifiable.</p>
<p>3. Personally Identifiable Information</p>
