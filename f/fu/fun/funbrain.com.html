              information that is tailored to your needs. In order to do that 

              we sometimes need to ask you for information so that we can provide 

              the kind of content you want, when you want it. We want to customize 

              our site for you so that it meets your needs as fully as possible--this 

              includes customizing articles, discussions, banners and more. We 

              may ask you to register or provide personal information when you 

              visit certain areas of Learning Network, enter a contest, play games, 

              complete surveys, subscribe to a service or to a newsletter, submit 

              content, or ask us for information. <br>

              <br>

              We consider the following to be personally identifiable information: 

              first and last name, e-mail address, street address, zip code, phone 

              number, and credit card number. We only collect personally identifiable 

              information from you when you voluntarily submit it. Providing your 

              personal information to Learning Network is optional. If you choose 

              not to register or provide personal information you can still use 

              our site but you will not have access to customized information.

              <br>

              Depending on the particular Learning Network site with which you 

              register, we may ask for your name, age, address and/or zip code, 

              e-mail address, name of school or district, and/or grade level. 

              If you are under 18 years of age, we will also ask you to provide 

              your parent’s or guardian’s e-mail address. We may also ask you 

              to choose a user name and password to use when you log in to the

              who are affiliated with our site, or with carefully selected companies 

              so you can receive information that we believe may be of interest

              <span>As a parent, you’ve probably done a lot of thinking 

              about protecting your family’s privacy on the Internet. Well, we’ve 

              been thinking about it, too. We are working hard to provide you 

              with the best information and the highest quality interaction on 

              the Internet in an environment that is safe. In compliance with 

              COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act), we have adopted 

              the following policies to keep kids safe: </span> 

            </p><ol>

              <ol>

                <li><span>We will NOT knowingly collect, use or 

                  distribute personally identifiable information 	from children 

                  under the age of 13 without prior verifiable consent from 	 

                  a parent or guardian. </span></li>

                <li><span>We will NOT knowingly collect, use or 

                  distribute personally identifiable information from teens between 

                  the ages of 13 and 17 without first notifying a parent or guardian.</span></li>

                <li><span>Personally identifiable information we 

                  collect from children under the age of 13 will be used solely 

                  by Learning Network or its agents for internal purposes only 

                  and will not be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties. 

                  </span></li>

                <li><span>We will NOT knowingly allow a child under 

                  the age of 13 access to chat rooms, message boards, e-mail accounts, 

                  or other services within Learning Network that would allow them 

                  to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable 

                  information without prior verifiable consent from a parent or 

                  guardian. </span></li>

                <li><span>We will NOT knowingly allow a teen between 

                  the ages of 13 and 17 access to chat rooms, message boards, 

                  e-mail accounts, or other services within Learning Network that 

                  would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally 

                  identifiable information without first notifying a parent or 

                  guardian. </span></li>

                <li><span>We will NOT knowingly ask a child or teen 

                  to divulge more information than is needed to participate in 

                  any activity, game, or service. </span></li>

                <li><span>We will NOT knowingly provide any direct 

                  link to Websites that are unsuitable for children or teens. 

                  </span></li>

                <li><span>Learning Network will not advertise on 

                  any site that does not comply with the regulations set forth 

                  under COPPA. </span></li>

                <li><span>We will advise children under the age 

                  of 13 that they MUST obtain permission from their parent or 

                  guardian before sharing ANY personal information. </span></li>

                <li><span>Upon request, Learning Network will provide 

                  a parent or guardian with a description of the information that 

                  may have been provided about their child or teen during a registration 

                  process for a program or service of this site. Learning Network 

                  only asks for a child's or teen's personal information if it 

                  is necessary to participate in the program or service. For example, 

                  use of the Learning Pod requires a parent or teacher to set 

                  up an account for their child or student by providing the child's 

                  first name, last initial, grade level and school zip code. This

                  to view your child's registration data, request a change, or 

                  request that we delete any of your child's personal information,

              <b><a name="Notification">Notification and Verifiable 

              Parental Consent:</a></b> <br>

              <br>

              <span>Certain areas and activities within Learning 

              Network ask visitors under the age of 18 to provide personal information 

              such as their name, date of birth, e-mail address or school name. 

              We only ask for the information that is necessary to participate 

              in the particular activity. <br>

              <br>

              Before any personally identifiable information is collected, we 

              will do our best to notify the parent or guardian that their child 

              or teen is participating. Notification will include the exact nature 

              and intended use of the information we are collecting, as well as 

              the opportunity for the parent or guardian to prevent the use of 

              the information and the child’s participation in the activity. If 

              the child is under 13 years of age we require the parent or guardian 

              to provide verifiable parental consent such as an e-mail, mail-in 

              letter, fax or toll free phone call to Learning Network. If the 

              individual is a teen between the ages of 13 and 17, Learning Network 

              will notify the parent or guardian that their teen is participating 

              and sharing personal information but we do not require consent. 

              </span> </p>

            <p><span>When verifiable parental consent has not yet 

              been obtained, we will use online contact information (such as an 

              e-mail address) only as is appropriate to: </span> 

            </p><ul>

              <li><span>request the name or online contact information 

                of a parent or guardian for the purpose of obtaining verifiable 

                parental consent or providing notification to the parent or guardian;</span></li>

              <li><span>respond directly to the child’s or teen’s 

                request on a one-time basis (for example, to provide assistance 

                with a particular study question), not using that information 

                to re-contact the child or teen for any other purpose;</span></li>

              <li><span>respond more than once directly to a specific 

                request from the child (for example, to satisfy the request for 

                a newsletter subscription), not using that information to re-contact 

                the child or teen for any other purpose.</span></li>

              request pages from Learning Network sites, our servers log the guests'
