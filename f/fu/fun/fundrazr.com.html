		<h2>Our Commitment To Privacy</h2>
		<p>ConnectionPoint Systems Inc. (including its subsidiaries,
			affiliates, agents, and service providers, collectively,
			“ConnectionPoint,” “we,” “us,” and/or “our”), operates an
			application (the “Application) and website (the “Website”),
			(collectively, the “Platform”) and provides its services (together
			with the Platform, the “Service”) to make it easy for users and
			visitors (“you,” and/or “your”) to raise money through your social
			networks for causes or projects you support and care about (the
			“Campaigns”).</p>
		<p>Except as provided below, this Privacy Policy describes and
			governs how we collect, use, share and protect data collected from
			users of, or visitors to, the Platform. We believe that you should
			have control over your information including how it is shared with
			others. We will not use or share your information with anyone,
			except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		<p>ConnectionPoint contracts with a select group of Business
			Partners to operate crowdfunding systems for them under their own
			brands. You may use the Service using one or more of the branded
			versions associated with our Business Partners. Our Business
			Partners are contracted and agree to abide by our Terms of Service
			and Privacy Policy. Regardless of which branded version of the
			Service you use, these same terms apply to you.</p>
		<p>By visiting the Platform, submitting information, making a
			contribution or using our Service, you acknowledge that you accept
			the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy and
			consent to having your data transferred to and/or processed in
			Canada and the United States. If you do not agree to this Privacy
			Policy, please do not use the Service.</p>
		<p>If you are in Europe:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>for the purposes of the EU General Data Protection
				Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”), the data controller is
				ConnectionPoint Systems Inc. and can be reached at the address set
				out below.</li>
			<li>"information" covers all personal data processed by us
				which means information that (either in isolation or in
				combination with other information) enables you to be identified
				directly or indirectly; and</li>
			<li>you will not need to consent to this Privacy Policy but do
				acknowledge you have read and understood its terms.</li>
		</ul>

		</p>


		<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

		<h3>A) When You Visit Our Website</h3>
		<p>You are free to explore the Website without providing any
			Personal Information about yourself. When you visit the Website and
			register for the Service, we request that you provide Personal
			Information about yourself, and we collect Navigational
			Information.</p>

		<h3>B) When You Use Our Subscription Service</h3>
		<p>We use our own Subscription Service to build webpages that
			people can visit to learn more about our Service. Information that
			we collect and manage using the Subscription Service for our own
			marketing belongs to us and is used, disclosed and protected
			according to this Privacy Policy.</p>

		<h3>C) Information Provided By Individuals</h3>
		<p>We may receive and store any information you enter on the
			Platform or provide to us in any other way that would allow us to
			identify you or contact you. Examples of information we may collect
			from you include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If you set up a personal account, we collect your name,
				email address and, if you choose, social information (from the
				social networking site you connected with), any photos that you
				upload to the Platform, your mailing address and phone number;</li>
			<li>Your email address and any information you provide to us
				when you email us, or <a href="https://fundrazr.com/pages/contact" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>, or when you post on the Platform;
			</li>
			<li>Information you provide about yourself on your account
				page, a project page or anywhere else on the Platform. For
				example, if you use any third-party platforms, such as Facebook,
				LinkedIn, Google or Twitter, to share information about yourself
				on the Platform, we collect that information; or</li>
			<li>If you enter a sweepstakes, we collect your name, address
				and contact information to administer the sweepstakes and fulfill
				prizes and, to the extent permitted by law, to provide you with
				information on upcoming events, announcements, and sweepstakes.</li>
			<li>Personal Information can also include information about
				any transactions, both free and paid, that you enter into on the
				Platform, or publicly available information that we acquire from
				service providers.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You may also provide us with special categories of personal
			data under the GDPR (also known as sensitive data) about yourself
			and/or third parties such as health information. When you provide
			such information, we will seek your explicit consent unless it is
			being published in relation to your campaign.</p>
		<p>If you do not want us to collect information about you, you
			can simply decide not to submit it to us. If you choose to decline
			to submit such information, you may not be able to take advantage
			of all of the services and products offered on the Platform.</p>

		<h3>D) Information Provided by Organizations</h3>
		<p>If you are a charity or nonprofit (each a "Charity") or a
			for-profit or social enterprise organization (each a “Business”),
			(collectively, an “Organization”) and you establish an account with
			us, we will collect the name, tax ID, and physical address of the
			Organization, and the name, email address, and phone number of the
			person who establishes a Organization account (the "Organization
			Contact"). We also may collect, if the Organization Contact chooses
			to provide it, additional descriptive information about the
			Organization including any photos uploaded to the Platform.</p>

		<h3>E) Passive Gathering of Information Electronically</h3>

		<h4>
			<a name="cookies"></a>1. Cookies
		</h4>
		<p>When you interact with our Service, we try to make that
			experience simple and meaningful. To help optimize this experience
			we collect some information from you. When you visit our Platform,
			our web server sends a cookie to your computer or mobile device (as
			the case may be). Cookies are small pieces of information which are
			issued to your computer or mobile device (as the case may be) when
			you visit a website or access or use a mobile application, and
			which store and sometimes track information about your use of the
			Platform (as the case may be). A number of cookies we use last only
			for the duration of your web or application session and expire when
			you close your browser or exit the application. Other cookies are
			used to remember you when you return to the Platform and will last
			for longer.</p>
		<p>Some of the cookies used by the Platform are set by us, and
			some are set by third parties who are delivering services on our
			behalf. If ConnectionPoint stores a cookie on your browser,
			ConnectionPoint may only access our own cookie, not that of another
			company.</p>
		<p>
			Most web and mobile device browsers automatically accept cookies
			but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or
			to notify you each time a cookie is set. You can also learn more
			about cookies by visiting <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>,
			which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to
			block cookies using different types of browsers or mobile devices.
			Please note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies used on
			the Platform, you may not be able to take full advantage of the
			Platform.
		</p>

		<h4>
			<a name="web_beacons"></a>2. Web Beacons
		</h4>
		<p>A web beacon is a transparent image file. Web beacons enable
			us to track website usage information, such as the number of times
			a given web page has been viewed. Web beacons are invisible to you
			and (unlike cookies) are not placed on your computer. We may use
			them in association with cookies to understand how visitors
			interact with the pages and content on the pages of the Platform.</p>
		<p>We may also use web beacons to track whether you have opened
			an HTML email. When the email is opened, a part of the code that
			makes up the HTML page calls a web server to load the web beacon
			that then generates a record showing that the email has been
			viewed. Web beacons may also recognize when the email was opened,
			how many times it was forwarded and which URL’s (links within the
			email) were clicked.</p>

		<h4>3. Pixel Tags</h4>
		<p>In addition, we use "Pixel Tags" (also referred to by Web
			beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a
			unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to
			track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which
			are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded
			invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail
			messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether
			e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only
			messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this
			information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do
			not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to information that
			is intended to identify our users.</p>

		<h3>F) Aggregate and De-Identified Information</h3>
		<p>From time to time, we may also ask you to provide us
			information that is not intended to allow us to identify you
			personally. This information may be aggregated and/or de-identified
			and used for our internal purposes or for creating reports for
			third-party partners, or otherwise shared with third parties for
			any lawful purpose, without your permission.</p>
		<p>
			We also may automatically collect Platform usage information, such
			as the numbers and frequency of users to the Platform, pages
			visited and similar data. This data is used in the aggregate and/or
			is de-identified, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a
			manner that is intended to identify you personally. Aggregate and
			de-identified information generally is collected through the use of
			<a href="#cookies">cookies</a> and <a href="#web_beacons">web
				beacons</a> as discussed above, but we may also aggregate or
			de-identify data that you provide to us. This aggregate and/or
			de-identified information helps us determine general usage patterns
			and modify the Platform in order to improve your experience. This
			type of aggregate information may be shared with third parties at
			any time.
		</p>

		<h3>G) Information from Third Parties</h3>
		<p>It may be necessary for us to obtain address or other
			information about you from third-party sources for fraud prevention
			or for legal compliance, to enforce our legal rights or to protect
			the rights of other users of the Platform and our Service.</p>


		<h2>How We Use Information</h2>
		<p>When you provide us with your information, we may use such
			information for a number of purposes, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To facilitate communication between us and you including,
				without limitation, responding to your questions or comments,
				sending emails concerning our products and services including
				upcoming events, announcements, and sweepstakes, or to contact you
				for feedback regarding us, advertisers or business partners;</li>
			<li>To administer your account, process contributions, provide
				products or services to you and for our marketing and promotional
				activities;</li>
			<li>To provide a report to a Organization or an event
				supporting a Organization to whom you have made a contribution or
				to a fundraiser to whom you have made a contribution, supported a
				project or joined a team (even if you have marked the contribution
				as non-public);</li>
			<li>To provide a report to a partner or campaign organizer who
				is helping promote a Organization or an event supporting a
				Organization to whom you have made a contribution, including your
				name, email address, or other similar information;</li>
			<li>To provide a report to our advertisers or business
				partners that tells them who responded to a particular offer or to
				facilitate the fulfillment of an order that you have made with an
				advertiser or business partner;</li>
			<li>To provide you with important functionality changes to the
				Platform, new ConnectionPoint services and, to the extent
				permitted by law, special offers from ConnectionPoint and
				reputable third parties that we think you will find valuable;</li>
			<li>To customize, analyze, adjust and improve the Platform to
				meet our advertisers’ or business partners’ needs and
				expectations;</li>
			<li>To enforce our agreements with you, prevent fraud and
				other prohibited or illegal activities, for other legally
				permissible purposes and generally to ensure that we comply with
				applicable laws;</li>
			<li>To send emails to friends based on your instructions as
				discussed in <a href="#email_communications">E-mail
					Communications to You and Your Friends</a>; or
			</li>
			<li>To associate users’ activities, customize content, or
				tailor advertising to those users across different devices and
				browsers (for instance, tablets, mobile devices and applications,
				and websites).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>ConnectionPoint may also use the publicly available
			information you provide to help promote your campaign on media
			websites such as our own website, television, radio, local or
			national newspapers, printed newspapers, blogs, forums and other
			electronic properties.</p>
		<p>For the purposes of the GDPR, we may use your information in
			the above ways as this is necessary: (i) to fulfill our obligations
			under our contract with you or in order to take steps at your
			request prior to entering into a contract; (ii) for our legitimate
			interest to maintain our relationship with you or protect you and
			us against fraud; or (iii) to comply with legal obligations.</p>


		<h2>Analytics</h2>
		<p>
			We may use third-party web analytics services on our Service, such
			as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort
			of technology previously described in the “Passive Gathering of
			Information Electronically” section to help us analyze how users
			use the Service, including by noting the third-party website from
			which you arrive, and provide certain features to you. The
			information (including your IP address) collected by the technology
			will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service
			providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the
			Service. This information may be used to place interest-based
			advertisements on the Platform. This may result in you seeing
			advertisements for our Platform when you visit other websites. To
			prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics,
			you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by
			clicking <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google
			Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google
				Analytics Terms of Use</a> and the <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
		</p>


		<h2>Tailored Advertising</h2>
		<p>We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow
			for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our
			Platform, as well as on other websites you visit. The ads may be
			based on various factors such as the content of the page you are
			visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your
			searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other
			information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your
			current activity or your activity over time and across other
			websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.</p>
		<p>Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible
			or advertised on our Platform may place cookies or other tracking
			technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to
			collect information about your use of the website as discussed
			above. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad
			servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve
			tailored ads to you on our website, other sites, and in other
			applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking
			technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you
			use to access the website. We may provide our customer information
			(such as a hashed version of your email addresses) to service

			parties the information of a user who we believe is in violation of

			security and rights of ConnectionPoint and of third parties.</p>

		<p>
			Any information you post publicly on the Platform including text,
			images, audio, video, graphics and other content or materials of
			any nature ("Publicly Available Content") is available to the

			Copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other
			users have copied or stored your Publicly Available Content even if
			you remove the Publicly Available Content. To request removal of
			your information from these areas of the Platform, contact us using
			the information below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove
			your information, in which case we will let you know if we are

		</p>


		<h2>Information You Provide to Facebook and Other Social
			Networking Sites</h2>
		<p>The Platform allows users to access Facebook to interact with
			friends and to share on Facebook through multiple options including
			Messenger and News Feeds. If you are already logged into the
			Platform and Facebook or another SNS, when you click on "Connect
			with Facebook," or a similar connection on another SNS, you will be
			prompted to merge your profiles. If you are already logged into the
			Services but not logged into Facebook or another SNS that we
			support, when you click on "Connect with Facebook," or a similar
			connection on another SNS, you will be prompted to enter your SNS
			credentials or to "Sign Up" for the SNS. By proceeding, you are
			allowing the Platform to access your information and you are
			agreeing to the Facebook or other SNS’s Terms of Use in your use of
			the Services. Conversely, if you are not currently registered as a
			user of the Platform, and you click on "Sign in" using Facebook or
			another SNS that we support, you will first be asked to enter your
			Facebook or SNS credentials and then be given the option to
			register for the Platform. In this case, we may receive information
			from Facebook or another SNS to make it easier for you to create an
			Account on the Platform and show our relevant content from your
			Facebook or SNS friends. Once you register on the Platform and
			connect with Facebook or another SNS you will be able to
			automatically post recent activity back to Facebook or the other
			SNS. Any information that we collect from your Facebook or other
			SNS account may depend on the privacy settings you have with that
			SNS, so please consult the SNS’s privacy and data practices.
			Further, you can edit privacy settings for the reviews that appear
			on Facebook, or disconnect your Service activity stream by visiting
			the Facebook Applications Settings page.</p>
