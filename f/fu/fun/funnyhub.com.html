<b>Privacy Policy</b><hr noshade="" size="1"><p>




Intercraze Media and our network of sites respects your right to privacy and does not collect any personal information that is not submitted by the user (such as signing up for one of our mailing lists or creating a user account).  In the event that we do obtain your e-mail address via submission, it will only be used for delivering newsletters (or to send an invitation to subscribe to a newsletter should you select this option) and will not be distributed to any third-party or subjected to commercial e-mail.</p><p>

The only possible way you will ever have your e-mail address subscribed to one of our newsletters is if you specifically verify the subscription by clicking a confirmation link in a verification e-mail.  If you receive any other type of mail from one of our domain names other than direct correspondence, such as spam or virus messages, these messages are forged and were not actually sent by Intercraze Media or one of our sites.  You may also unsubscribe from any of our newsletters immediately by visiting the link provided at the bottom of each newsletter message.</p><p>

We have also taken precautions to ensure that our e-mail lists are not illegally obtained by an outside party, although we cannot guarantee that this isn't at least a possibility.</p><p>

The Intercraze Media network of sites may distribute cookies on your personal computer, but they do not collect any personally identifiable information (a.k.a. spyware).  The purpose of these cookies is merely to prevent visitors from rating the same page of content more than once so the scoring is fair and cannot be unfairly manipulated by a single user, or to remember your settings each time you visit the same site.</p><p>

The advertisements on Intercraze Media's network of sites are provided by both direct advertisers and third-party ad networks, including <a href="http://www.fastclick.com/re.f?17857" target="_blank">ValueClick Media</a>, <a href="http://www.tribalfusion.com" target="_blank">Tribal Fusion</a>, <a href="http://www.casalemedia.com" target="_blank">Casale Media</a>, <a href="http://www.cpxinteractive.com" target="_blank">CPX Interactive</a>, and other similar ad networks.  These ads often distribute cookies for the purpose of frequency capping and optimization, which we consider to be a legitimate use of technology.  These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to various sites in order to provide advertisements on our sites and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. To learn more, you will need to visit each respective company's website.</p><p>

While Intercraze Media will make every effort to prevent ads that contain spyware, adware, or other malicious programs (such as drive-by-downloads) we cannot always guarantee their exclusion due to the third-party nature of online advertising.
