                  <p>FundsXpress Financial Network, Inc. ("FundsXpress") 
                    takes great pride in enabling its financial institution clients 
                    to provide secure online financial transactions. We enjoy 
                    a high level of trust and confidence from our clients and 
                    their customers, and we strive daily to justify and maintain 
                    that trust and confidence.</p>
                  <p>The employees of FundsXpress use the Internet everyday, and 
                    we too are sensitive to the privacy of our personal information. 
                    Since we are Internet users, like you, it’s only natural 
                    that we would assume that you might feel the same way about 
                    the privacy of your personal information. With that in mind, 
                    we have developed the following Privacy Policy to describe 
                    the type information that we collect on the Internet. This 
                    Policy also explains how FundsXpress uses and protects this 
                    information.</p>
                  <p>Our Privacy Policy is directed to FundsXpress financial institution 
                    clients and Website visitors. Section (1) describes our policy 
                    for visitors to the FundsXpress Website and Section (2) describes 
                    our policy for protecting the consumer information of our 
                    clients (the end-users of FundsXpress products). These policies 
                    are in addition to the extensive security measures that FundsXpress 
                    takes to protect end-user financial transactions on the Internet. 
                    Section (4) includes a discussion of these security measures.</p>
                  <p><strong>Visitors to the FundsXpress Website </strong></p>
                  <p>FundsXpress collects general information on its Website visitors 
                    simply for statistical and security purposes. Such information

                    <li>The Internet address (referral site) which brought you 
                      to our Website; </li>

                    <li>The pages visited in our Website. </li>
                  </ul>

                    FundsXpress uses a cookie to collect this general information 
                    on all Website visitors. We may use this information in a 
                    consolidated, non-personally identifiable, format to assist 
                    us in offering the services and features that are of particular 
                    interest to our clients. We may also use this information 
                    to monitor the security and performance of our site.
                  <p>You may elect to provide us with more specific or personal 
                    information, such as when you give us feedback or send us 
                    an email requesting additional information from our sales 
                    department. If you provide personal information to us, it 
                    is only used internally and in furtherance of the purpose 
                    for which it was provided. Please note that all visitors and 
                    clients also have the option of contacting us by telephone.</p>
                  <p>FundsXpress provides a “Client Site” to provide 
                    additional information and support to our financial institution 
                    clients. For security purposes, this section of our Website 
                    requires authentication with an Access ID and Passcode. </p>
                  <p>FundsXpress does not share or sell information collected 
                    from Website visitors. Also, FundsXpress will not send unsolicited 
                    email (spam) to our Website visitors.</p>
                  <p>FundsXpress reserves the right to monitor and make records 
                    of transactions and interchanges made over its networks, this 
                    includes failed log-on attempts in the "Client Site". 
                    You will not necessarily be told (unless the notification 
                    is required by law) that a transaction or interchange in which 
                    you are participating is being monitored or recorded. Monitoring 
                    and recording transactions or interchanges may be initiated, 
                    for example, if we suspect a possible breach in security or 
                    some other problem that would make it appropriate to monitor 
                    or maintain these records. We do not use this information 
                    for any improper purposes or distribute it to third parties, 
                    except as required or permitted by law.</p>
                  <p><strong>Financial Institution Customer Information (End-Users) 
                    </strong></p>
                  <p>As an Application Service Provider (ASP), non-public personal 
                    information of end-users may be housed or transmitted through 
                    our data center in order to provide our clients financial 
                    services such as: fxeBanking<sup>SM</sup>, fxBusiness Banking<sup>SM</sup>, fxLending<sup>SM</sup>, 
                    fxPortana<sup>SM</sup>, and fxFinance Center<sup>SM</sup>.</p>
                  <p>End-users have high expectations for the confidentiality 
                    and privacy of their personal information. We recognize these 
                    expectations and strive to ensure that we protect the confidentiality 
                    of this information to the same extent that our client financial 
                    institutions must do.</p>
                  <p>The information provided below describes the practices that 
                    FundsXpress takes to safeguard the personal and confidential 
                    information of its end-users.</p>
                  <p><strong>Collection and Use of End-User Information </strong></p>
                  <p>FundsXpress only collects and maintains information on the 
                    end-users of FundXpress’ services in order to be responsive 
                    to user needs, provide contracted services to our clients, 
                    manage our lawful business, and maintain appropriate records. 
                    Generally speaking the information collected falls into two 
                    broad categories: (1) Information that is generated when a 
                    user contacts FundsXpress electronically, simply by virtue 
                    of the manner in which Internet communications are initiated 
                    and handled; and (2) Information that is expressly or incidentally 
                    created in connection with a transaction or providing a service. 
                  </p>
                  <p>An example of the information collected under (1) may include 
                    the user’s IP address and referral Website, which would 
                    be logged when a consumer visits a financial institution Website 
                    hosted by FundsXpress or when a consumer or end-user visits 
                    the fx eBanking<sup>SM</sup> gateway page. An example of the 
                    information collected under (2) might include specific customer 
                    account information, such as an account number, account balance, 
                    access identification information, account statements, and/or 
                    bill payment activity.</p>
                  <p>FundsXpress may extract from and compile non-personally identifiable 
                    end-user information collected via (1) and/or (2) in a consolidated 
                    format for statistical and research purposes. Such information 
                    might detail the number of bill pay customers, the most typical 
                    payees, the number of registered users on fxPortana<sup>SM</sup> and/or 
                    fxFinance Center<sup>SM</sup>, and the time users most frequently use 
                    our services. With respect to former end-users we only retain 
                    this information as necessary to meet our legal obligations 
                    and record retention requirements.</p>
                  <p>Similar to our policy for Website visitors, FundsXpress reserves 
                    the right to collect and monitor all transactions on our networks 
                    and applications. End-users will not necessarily be told (unless 
                    the notification is required by law) that a transaction or 
                    interchange in which they are participating is being monitored 
                    or recorded. Monitoring and recording transactions or interchanges 
                    may be initiated, for example, if we suspected a possible 
                    breach in security or some other problem that would make it 
                    appropriate to monitor or maintain these records. FundsXpress 
                    also reserves the right to disclose such information to regulatory 
                    and governmental authorities if required.</p>
                  <p><strong>Third Party Disclosure </strong></p>
                  <p>FundsXpress understands that end users of FundsXpress products 
                    expect that their financial information and transactions will 
                    be handled in a confidential manner. We do not use confidential 
                    consumer information for any improper purposes or distribute 
                    it to third parties, except as required or permitted by law, 
                    or as necessary to provide a contracted service.</p>
                  <p>It is the policy of FundsXpress that non-public, personally 
                    identifiable consumer information may only be disclosed to 
                    third parties when:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The user, either directly or through our client financial 
                      institution, is believed to have requested or authorized 
                      the disclosure; </li>
                    <li>It is necessary to administer the service or complete 
                      a transaction, such as bill pay; or</li>
                    <li>It is required or allowed by law (such as, but not limited 
                      to, responding to a subpoena or court order, reporting information 
                      to legal authorities, regulatory agencies, or other appropriate 
                      investigators in connection with a legal investigation or 
                      similar matter). </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>
                  FundsXpress contractually requires its third party service providers 
                  to protect the confidentiality of the non-public consumer information 
                  received from FundsXpress. Third party service providers are 
                  only permitted to use such information for the purpose for which 
                  it was provided, such as for bill payments.<p></p> 
                  <p>FundsXpress does provide marketing services and support to 
                    its clients in order to promote online financial products 
                    to end-users. We may provide aggregate and/or consolidated 
                    end-user information to our clients to assist in marketing 
                    financial institution products and services. This service 
                    is part of the financial services package that we offer each 
                    client. Our marketing efforts are coordinated with each client 
                    financial institution and because of this, our clients are 
                    aware of and involved with any joint marketing ventures. FundsXpress 
                    does not disclose any nonpublic, personally identifiable end-user 
                    information with any third party advertising firms.</p>

                  <p><strong>End-User Security</strong></p>
                  <p>FundsXpress utilizes a comprehensive security strategy to 
                    protect user accounts and transactions conducted over the 
                    Internet. We use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption 
                    technology for all communications with the end-user. The communication 
                    is encrypted every time an end-user enters an access ID, passcode, 
                    or personal information during an online application or registration 
                    process. All financial transactions conducted by end-users 
                    are also SSL encrypted. FundsXpress servers use digital certificates 
                    to assure the end-user that they are actually talking to FundsXpress 
                    servers instead of someone pretending to be FundsXpress.</p>
                  <p><strong>Internal Security</strong></p>
                  <p>The architectural design of the system, the data center, 
                    policies, procedures, staff, hardware, and software selected 
                    for the FundsXpress systems are chosen with security in mind 
                    so that all transactions and customer information will be 
                    safe and secure. Internal security features include authentication 
                    software, encryption, VPN technologies, firewalls, anti-virus 
                    protection, network and host intrusion detection devices. 
                  </p>
                  <p>The secure FundsXpress data center is designed to protect 
                    our equipment, software, and confidential information assets. 
                    FundsXpress has established policies and access controls which 
                    restrict employee access to sensitive and confidential information 
                    only as necessary for their job responsibilities. FundsXpress 
                    performs background checks on its employees and requires all

                  <p>FundsXpress maintains physical, electronic, and procedural 
                    safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard customer 
                    information. Technology relating to Internet security is evolving 
                    rapidly, as are ways to circumvent security. Thus FundsXpress 
                    continually strives to stay abreast of developments in Internet 
                    security to thwart any potential threats to our security. 
                  </p>
                  <p>FundsXpress clients are encouraged to contact the FundsXpress 
                    customer service department immediately if an unauthorized 
                    activity is suspected. It is the policy of FundsXpress to 
                    investigate all such matters promptly and report to the proper 
                    authorities. </p>
                  <p><strong>A Word About Cookies</strong> </p>
                  <p>A cookie is a very small text file sent by a Web server and 
                    stored in your computer’s or browser's memory so that 
                    it can be read back later. Cookies are a basic way for a server 
                    to identify the computer you happen to be using at the time, 
                    not you personally. Cookies are used for many things from 
                    personalizing start up pages to facilitating online purchases. 
                    Cookies do perform a very important function when you engage 
                    in secure Internet banking.</p>
                  <p>FundsXpress uses cookies in its products for security, statistics, 
                    and enhanced functionality. For example, with fxeBanking<sup>SM</sup>, 
                    we use an encrypted cookie to identify the end-user’s 
                    computer while they are logged on. This cookie enables us 
                    to process multiple transactions during the session without 
                    having to provide an access ID and passcode for each individual 
                    transaction. Users must accept this cookie to use fxeBanking<sup>SM</sup>. 
                    When the user logs off, or after ten minutes of inactivity, 
                    the cookie is no longer accepted and must be renewed by requiring 
                    the passcode to be reentered. A new cookie is used for each 
                    session. That way, no one can use the prior cookie to access 
                    the user’s account.</p>
                  <p>fxPortana<sup>SM</sup> cookies are also used for security purposes and 
                    to collect general statistical information on all visitors. 
                    These cookies enable registered users to customize certain 
                    features, such as their stock portfolio and local weather. 
                    They also enable the user to bypass the login process each 
                    time they revisit. These cookies only contain a unique user 
                    identification number and do not contain or collect any personally 
                    identifiable information. </p>
                  <p>When FundsXpress hosts financial institution Websites, we 
                    may also use a cookie to collect the same type of general 
                    information that we collect on this Website. This information 
                    is collected for security and statistical purposes.</p>
                  <p>We do not disclose any information collected through cookies 
                    with third parties. However, we may provide consolidated, 
                    non-personally identifiable information to our clients, such 
                    as the most frequently accessed pages within a Website or 
                    the most frequently used browsers.</p>
