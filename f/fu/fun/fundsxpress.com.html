            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>The operating subsidiaries of FundsXpress Inc. (“FundsXpress”) 
              take great pride in enabling our financial institution clients and 
              their customers or members to perform secure and convenient financial 
              transactions over the Internet everyday. We enjoy a high level of 
              trust and confidence from our clients and their customers, and we 
              strive daily to justify and maintain that trust and confidence.</p>
            <p>The employees of FundsXpress use the Internet everyday, and we 
              too are sensitive to the privacy of our personal information when 
              we visit the millions of Web sites that are part of the World Wide 
              Web. Since we are Internet users, like you, it’s only natural 
              that we would assume that you might feel the same way about the 
              privacy of your personal information. With that in mind, we have 
              developed the following Privacy Policy to describe the information 
              that we collect on the Internet and to explain how we use and protect 
              this information.</p>
            <p>This privacy policy is directed to our financial institution clients 
              and Website users. Section (1) describes our policy for visitors 
              to the FundsXpress Website and Section (2) describes our policy 
              for protecting the consumer information of our clients (the end-users 
              of FundsXpress products). These policies are in addition to the 
              extensive security measures that we take to protect end-user financial 
              transactions on the Internet. Section (4) includes a discussion 
              of these security measures.</p>
            <h2>Visitors to the FundsXpress Inc. Website</h2>
            <p>FundsXpress does collect general information on our Website visitors 
              simply for statistical and security purposes. Such information may 
              include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Internet address (referral site) which brought you to our 
                Website; </li>
              <li>The date and time you access our site; </li>
              <li>The name and version of your web browser; </li>
              <li>The Internet service provider you used when you accessed our 
                site; </li>
              <li>Your Internet Protocol (IP) address; and </li>
              <li>The pages visited in our Website. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>FundsXpress uses a cookie to collect this general information on 
              all Website visitors. We may use this information in a consolidated, 
              non-personally identifiable, format to assist us in offering the 
              services and features that are of particular interest to our clients. 
              We may also use this information to monitor the security and performance 
              of our site.</p>
            <p>You may elect to provide us with more specific or personal information, 
              such as when you give us feedback or send us an email requesting 
              additional information from our sales department. If you provide 
              personal information to us, it is only used internally and in furtherance 
              of the purpose for which it was provided. Please note that all visitors 
              and clients also have the option of contacting us by telephone.</p>
            <p>FundsXpress does have a “members only” section of the 
              Website that’s designed to provide additional information and 
              support to our financial institution clients. This section requires 
              members to provide an access ID and passcode for identification 
              and security purposes.</p>
            <p>We do not share or sell information that we collect from visitors 
              to the FundsXpress Website. Also, we will not send unsolicited email 
              (spam) to our Website visitors.</p>
            <p>FundsXpress reserves the right to monitor and make records of transactions 
              and interchanges made over its networks, this includes failed log-on 
              attempts in the members only section of our website. You will not 
              necessarily be told (unless the notification is required by law) 
              that a transaction or interchange in which you are participating 
              is being monitored or recorded. Monitoring and recording transactions 
              or interchanges may be initiated, for example, if we suspect a possible 
              breach in security or some other problem that would make it appropriate 
              to monitor or maintain these records. We do not use this information 
              for any improper purposes or distribute it to third parties, except 
              as required or permitted by law.</p>
            <h2>Financial Institution Customer Information (End-Users)</h2>
            <p>As an Application Service Provider (ASP), non-public personal information 
              of end-users may be housed or transmitted through our data center 
              in order to provide our clients such services as Internet Banking, 
              Lending Management, Commercial Cash Management, Portana Dynamic 
              Websites, and Account Aggregation. End-users have high expectations 
              for the confidentiality and privacy of their personal information. 
              We recognize these expectations and strive to ensure that we protect 
              the confidentiality of this information to the same extent that 
              our client financial institutions must do.</p>
            <p>The information provided below describes the practices that FundsXpress 
              takes to safeguard the personal and confidential information of 
              our end-users.</p>
            <h2>Collection and use of end-user information</h2>
            <p>FundsXpress only collects and maintains information on the end-users 
              of the FundsXpress’ services in order to be responsive to user 
              needs, provide contracted services to our clients, manage our lawful 
              business, and to maintain appropriate records. Generally speaking 
              the information collected falls into two broad categories:</p>
            <p>Information that is generated when a user contacts FundsXpress 
              electronically, simply by virtue of the manner in which Internet 
              communications are initiated and handled; and <br>
              Information that is expressly or incidentally created in connection 
              with a transaction or providing a service. <br>
              An example of the information collected under (1) may include the 
              user’s IP address and referral website, which would be logged 
              when a consumer visits a financial institution website hosted by 
              FundsXpress or when a consumer or end-user visits the Internet Banking 
              gateway page. An example of the information collected under (2) 
              might include specific customer account information, access identification 
              information, and bill pay activity.</p>
            <p>FundsXpress may extract from and compile non-personally identifiable 
              end-user information collected via (1) and/or (2) in a consolidated 
              format for statistical and research purposes. Such information might 
              detail the number of bill pay customers, the most typical payees, 
              the number of registered Portal customers, and the time users most 
              frequently use our services. With respect to former end-users we 
              only retain this information as necessary to meet our legal obligations 
              and record retention requirements.</p>
            <p>Similar to our policy for Website visitors, FundsXpress reserves 
              the right to collect and monitor all transactions on our networks 
              and applications. End-users will not necessarily be told (unless 
              the notification is required by law) that a transaction or interchange 
              in which they are participating is being monitored or recorded. 
              Monitoring and recording transactions or interchanges may be initiated, 
              for example, if we suspected a possible breach in security or some 
              other problem that would make it appropriate to monitor or maintain 
              these records. FundsXpress also reserves the right to disclose such 
              information to regulatory and governmental authorities if required.</p>
            <h2>3rd party disclosure</h2>
            <p>FundsXpress understands that end users of FundsXpress products 
              expect that their financial information and transactions will be 
              handled in a confidential manner. We do not use confidential consumer 
              information for any improper purposes or distribute it to third 
              parties, except as required or permitted by law, or as necessary 
              to provide a contracted service.</p>
            <p>It is the policy of FundsXpress that non-public, personally identifiable 
              consumer information may only be disclosed to third parties when:</p>
            <p>The user, either directly or through our client financial institution, 
              is believed to have requested or authorized the disclosure; <br>
              It is necessary to administer the service or complete a transaction, 
              such as bill pay; or <br>
              It is required or allowed by law (such as, but not limited to, responding 
              to a subpoena or court order, reporting information to legal authorities, 
              regulatory agencies, or other appropriate investigators in connection 
              with a legal investigation or similar matter). <br>
              We contractually require our third party service providers to protect 
              the confidentiality of the non-public consumer information received 
              from FundsXpress. Third party service providers are only permitted 
              to use such information for the purpose for which it was provided, 
              such as for bill payments.</p>
            <p>FundsXpress does provide marketing services and support to our 
              clients in order to promote our products to the end-users. We may 
              provide aggregate and/or consolidated end-user information to our 
              clients to assist in marketing financial institution products and 
              services. This service is part of the financial services package 
              that we offer each client. Our marketing efforts are coordinated 
              with each client financial institution and because of this, our 
              clients are aware of and involved with any joint marketing ventures. 
              We do not disclose any nonpublic, personally identifiable end-user 
              information with any third party advertising firms.</p>
            <h2>Security Features</h2>
            <p><b><font color="#666666">End-User Security</font></b><br>
              FundsXpress utilizes a comprehensive security strategy to protect 
              user accounts and transactions conducted over the Internet. We use 
              the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology for all communications 
              with the end-user. The communication is encrypted every time an 
              end-user enters an access ID, passcode, or personal information 
              during an application or registration process. All financial transactions 
              conducted by end-users are SSL encrypted. In addition, our servers 
              have been certified by a "Certificate Authority" that 
              will assure your customers and members that they are actually talking 
              to our servers instead of someone pretending to be us.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#666666">Internal Security</font></b><br>
              The architectural design of the system, the data center, policies, 
              procedures, staff, hardware, and software selected for the FundsXpress 
              systems are chosen with security in mind so that all transactions 
              and customer information will be safe and secure. Internal security 
              features include our Kerberos authentication software, DES and Triple 
              DES Encryption, routers/firewalls, and real-time intrusion detection 
              devices. Our new products will incorporate the latest security features 
              and advanced technologies on the market.</p>
            <p>Our secure data center protects our equipment, software, employees, 
              as well as customer, member, and visitor information. We have established 
              policies and incorporated many internal security systems that are 
              designed to minimize our employees’ ability to access personal 
              information relating to the end-users. We perform background checks 
              on our employees, require them to sign non-disclosure agreements, 
              and we restrict access to consumer information so that only authorized 
              employees can access the information that is necessary to provide 
              the contracted products and services to our clients and their end-users. 
              All information collected from our Website visitors is also securely 
              stored with limited employee access.</p>
            <p>We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that 
              comply with federal standards to guard customer information. However, 
              despite all our efforts related to security, like any other technology-based 
              system, a security breach may occur. Technology relating to Internet 
              security is evolving rapidly, as are ways to circumvent that security. 
              Although we use state of the art security measures and take every 
              reasonable effort to stay abreast of developments in Internet security, 
              there is always the possibility that someone will find a way to 
              gain unauthorized access to any system, including ours.</p>
            <p>Our clients should contact the FundsXpress customer service department 
              immediately if an unauthorized access is identified, even if there 
              does not appear to be any loss involved. It is the policy of FundsXpress 
              to investigate all such matters promptly and report intrusion attempts 
              to the proper authorities. Electronic theft is a crime, and if we 
              suspect that someone has attempted or perpetrated it, we would like 
              to have your cooperation in taking the appropriate, remedial measures. 
              In-depth information on many of the techniques and features employed 
              by the system are detailed under our discussion of security elsewhere 
              on this Web site.</p>
            <h2>A Word About Cookies</h2>
            <p>A cookie is a very small text file sent by a web server and stored 
              in your computer’s or browsers’ memory so that it can 
              be read back later. Cookies cannot "read" information 
              about you from your hard drive or be used to "steal" information 
              about you. Cookies are a basic way for a server to identify the 
              computer you happen to be using at the time, not you personally. 
              Cookies are used for many things from personalizing start up pages 
              to facilitating online purchases. Cookies do perform a very important 
              function when you engage in secure Internet banking.</p>
            <p>FundsXpress uses cookies in our products for security, statistics, 
              and enhanced functionality. For example, with our Internet Banking 
              product, we use a Triple DES encrypted cookie to identify the end-user’s 
              computer while they are logged on. When a user logs on to the Internet 
              Banking application, we send the user a cookie that enables us to 
              process multiple transactions during the session without having 
              to provide an access ID and passcode for each individual transaction. 
              Users must accept this cookie to use the FundsXpress Internet Banking 
              product. When the user logs off, or after ten minutes of inactivity, 
              the cookie is no longer accepted and must be renewed by requiring 
              the passcode to be reentered. A new cookie is used for each session. 
              That way, no one can use the prior cookie to access the user’s 
              account.</p>
            <p>We use several cookies to provide features within our Portana and 
              Dynamic Websites. Portana and Dynamic Website cookies are also used 
              for security purposes and to collect general statistical information 
              on all visitors. Portana cookies enable registered users to customize 
              certain features, such as their stock portfolio and local weather. 
              Portana cookies also enable the users to bypass the login process 
              each time they revisit. These cookies only contain a unique user 
              identification number and do not contain or collect any personally 
              identifiable information. Users must accept most of the Portana 
              cookies in order to view site.</p>
            <p>When we host financial institution Websites, we also use a cookie 
              to collect the same type of general information that we collect 
              on this website. This information is collected for security and 
              statistical purposes.</p>
            <p>We do not disclose general information collected through cookies 
              with any third party; however, we may provide consolidated, non-personally 
              identifiable information to our clients, such as the most frequently 
              accessed pages within a website and/or Portal, or the most frequently 
              used browsers.</p>
