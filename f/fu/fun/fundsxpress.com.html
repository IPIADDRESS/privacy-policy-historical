              The FundsXpress Internet banking system is part of the FundsXpress
            Financial Network that utilizes a comprehensive security strategy 
              to protect your accounts and transactions conducted over the Internet. 
              In-depth information on many of the techniques and features employed 
              by the system are detailed under our discussion of <a href="security.htm" target="_parent">security</a> 
              elsewhere in this web site. In addition to our log-on security, 
              we use the SSL (secure socket layer) <a href="security.htm">encryption</a> 
              technology for everything you do in the Internet banking system. 
              This technology is automatically activated by your browser when 
              it attempts to connect to our system and it will support either 
              the 40 or 128 bit key lengths. (Click <a href="security.htm">here</a> 
              for the difference between 40 bit and 128 bit encryption.) For enhanced 
              security, we recommend that you use a browser that supports 128 
              bit key lengths, and we will warn you when your browser is set to 
              use the lower security level encryption of 40 bits. Whenever SSL 
              is securing your communications, the browser will typically indicate 
              the "<a href="security.htm">secure session</a>" 
              by changing the appearance of a small icon, such as a key or a padlock, 
              at the bottom of the screen. In addition, our servers have been 
              certified by a "Certificate Authority" that will ensure 
              you that you are actually talking to our servers instead of someone 
              pretending to be us. (If you are using an older browser, such as 
              anything prior to than versions 4.0 on Netscape or Internet Explorer, 
              the "Certificate Authorities" key may be expired and you 
              may need to update it on your browser.</font> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">During your use of the FundsXpress 
              Internet banking system, we will pass a <u><font face="Verdana" size="1" color="#339933">cookie</font></u> 
              to your browser for identifying you during the session. We do not 
              (and can not) use cookies to obtain new information about you. A 
              <u><font face="Verdana" size="1" color="#339933">cookie</font></u>

              are chosen with security in mind so all transactions will be safe 
              and secure. Not only by policy, but by incorporating many internal 
              security systems we minimize our employees’ ability to access personal 
              information relating to customers. Despite all our efforts related 
              to security, like any other technology based system, a security 
              breach may occur. Technology relating to Internet security is evolving 
              rapidly, as are ways to circumvent that security. Although we use 
              state of the art security measures and take every reasonable effort 
              to stay abreast of developments in Internet security, there is always 
              the possibility that someone will find a way to gain unauthorized 
              access to any system, including ours. If you suspect that anyone 
              has gained unauthorized access to your account or the system, you 
              should immediately contact our customer service department at 800.419.8804 
              or <a href="mailto:support@fundsxpress.com">support@fundsxpress.com</a>, 
              even if there does not appear to be any loss involved. It is the 
              policy of FundsXpress to investigate all such matters promptly. 
              Electronic theft is a crime, and if we suspect that someone has 
              attempted or perpetrated it, we would like to have your cooperation 
              in taking the appropriate, remedial measures.</font></p>

              and much of what is said has people worried about them. A cookie 
              is a very small text file sent by a web server and stored on a browser 
              so that it can be read back later. Cookies cannot "read" 
              information about you from your hard drive or be used to "steal" 
              information about you; cookies don’t carry viruses; and cookies 
              are not programs that can perform functions on your computer. </font>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cookies are a basic way for a server 
              to identify you (most cookies actually identify the computer you 
              happen to be using at the time, not you personally), and cookies 
              are used for many things from personalizing start up pages to facilitating

              without you having to provide your Access ID and passcode for each 
              individual transaction. When you log off, or after ten minutes, 
              the cookie is no longer accepted and must be renewed by requiring 
              the passcode to be reentered. A new cookie is used for each session. 
              That way, no one can use the prior cookie to access your account.
