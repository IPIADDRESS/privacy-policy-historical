      <p> <b> </b>The operating subsidiaries of FundsXpress Inc. (“FundsXpress”) 
        take great pride in enabling our financial institution clients and their 
        customers or members to perform secure and convenient financial transactions 
        over the Internet every day. We enjoy a high level of trust and confidence 
        from our clients and their customers, and we strive daily to justify and 
        maintain that trust and confidence.</p>
      <p>The employees of FundsXpress use the Internet everyday, and we too are 
        sensitive to the privacy of our personal information when we visit the 
        millions of Web sites that are part of the World Wide Web. Since we are 
        Internet users, like you, it’s only natural that we would assume that 
        you might feel the same way about the privacy of your personal information. 
        With that in mind, we have developed the following Privacy Policy to describe 
        the information that we collect on the Internet and to explain how we 
        use and protect this information.</p>
      <p>This privacy policy is directed to our financial institution clients 
        and Web site users. Section (1) describes our policy for visitors to the 
        FundsXpress Web site and Section (2) describes our policy for protecting 
        the consumer information of our clients (the end-users of FundsXpress 
        products). These policies are in addition to the extensive security measures 
        that we take to protect end-user financial transactions on the Internet. 
        Section (4) includes a discussion of these security measures.</p>
      <p> <b><font color="#003366">1. Visitors to the FundsXpress Inc. Web Site</font></b></p>
      <p>FundsXpress does collect general information on our Web site visitors 
        simply for statistical and security purposes. Such information may include:</p>
      <p> 
      </p><ul>
        <li>The Internet address (referral site) which brought you to our Web 
          site;</li>
        <li>The date and time you access our site;</li>
        <li>The name and version of your Web browser;</li>
        <li>The Internet service provider you used when you accessed our site;</li>
        <li>Your Internet Protocol (IP) address; and</li>
        <li>The pages visited in our Web site.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>FundsXpress uses a cookie to collect this general information on all 
        Web site visitors. We may use this information in a consolidated, non-personally 
        identifiable, format to assist us in offering the services and features 
        that are of particular interest to our clients. We may also use this information 
        to monitor the security and performance of our site.</p>
      <p>You may elect to provide us with more specific or personal information, 
        such as when you give us feedback or send us an email requesting additional 
        information from our sales department. If you provide personal information 
        to us, it is only used internally and in furtherance of the purpose for 
        which it was provided. Please note that all visitors and clients also 
        have the option of contacting us by telephone.</p>
      <p>FundsXpress does have a members only section of the Web site that’s designed 
        to provide additional information and support to our financial institution 
        clients. This section requires members to provide an access ID and passcode 
        for identification and security purposes.</p>
      <p>We do not share or sell information that we collect from visitors to 
        the FundsXpress Web site. Also, we will not send unsolicited email (spam) 
        to our Web site visitors.</p>
      <p>FundsXpress reserves the right to monitor and make records of transactions 
        and interchanges made over its networks, this includes failed log-on attempts 
        in the members only section of our Web site. You will not necessarily be 
        told (unless the notification is required by law) that a transaction or 
        interchange in which you are participating is being monitored or recorded. 
        Monitoring and recording transactions or interchanges may be initiated, 
        for example, if we suspect a possible breach in security or some other 
        problem that would make it appropriate to monitor or maintain these records. 
        We do not use this information for any improper purposes or distribute 
        it to third parties, except as required or permitted by law.</p>
      <p> <b><font color="#003366">2. Financial Institution Customer Information 
        (End-Users)</font></b></p>
      <p><b> </b>As an Application Service Provider (ASP), non-public personal 
        information of end-users may be housed or transmitted through our data 
        center in order to provide our clients such services as<b> </b>Internet 
        Banking, Lending Management, Commercial Cash Management, Portana, Dynamic 
        Web sites, the Digital Wallet, and Account Aggregation. End-users have 
        high expectations for the confidentiality and privacy of their personal 
        information. We recognize these expectations and strive to ensure that 
        we protect the confidentiality of this information to the same extent 
        that our clients must protect this information.</p>
      <p>The information provided below describes the practices that FundsXpress 
        takes to safeguard and control personal and confidential information regarding 
        end-users of FundsXpress products.</p>
      <p>In the future, consumer customers may utilize our digital wallet, account 
        aggregation, and brokerage products. We will have separate policies for 
        these products that are directed to our consumer customers. Our brokerage 
        subsidiary, Choice Investments, Inc., has established a separate policy 
        for its clients. This policy can be viewed at <font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://www.choiceinv.com"><b>www.choiceinv.com</b></a></font>.</p>
      <p><b><i>Collection and use of end-user information</i></b></p>
      <p>FundsXpress only collects and maintains information on the end-users 
        of the FundsXpress’ services in order to be responsive to user needs, 
        provide contracted services to our clients, manage our lawful business, 
        and to maintain appropriate records. Generally speaking the information 
        collected falls into two broad categories:</p>
      <p> 
      </p><blockquote> 
        <p>(1) Information that is generated when a user contacts FundsXpress 
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electronically, simply by virtue of the manner 
          in which Internet <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; communications are initiated and handled, and</p>
        <p>(2) Information that is expressly or incidentally created in connection 
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a transaction or providing a service.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>An example of the information collected under (1) may include the user’s 
        IP address and referral Web site, which would be logged when a consumer 
        visits a financial institution Web site hosted by FundsXpress or when a 
        consumer or end-user visits the Internet Banking gateway page. An example 
        of the information collected under (2) might include specific customer 
        account information, access identification information, and bill pay activity.</p>
      <p>FundsXpress may extract from and compile non-personally identifiable 
        end-user information collected via (1) and/or (2) in a consolidated format 
        for statistical and research purposes. Such information might detail the 
        number of bill pay customers, the most typical payees, the number of registered 
        Portal customers, and the time users most frequently use our services. 
        With respect to former end-users we only retain this information as necessary 
        to meet our legal obligations and record retention requirements.</p>
      <p>Similar to our policy for Web site visitors, FundsXpress reserves the 
        right to collect and monitor all transactions on our networks and applications. 
        End-users will not necessarily be told (unless the notification is required 
        by law) that a transaction or interchange in which they are participating 
        is being monitored or recorded. Monitoring and recording transactions 
        or interchanges may be initiated, for example, if we suspected a possible 
        breach in security or some other problem that would make it appropriate 
        to monitor or maintain these records. FundsXpress also reserves the right 
        to disclose such information to regulatory and governmental authorities 
        if required.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#003366">3. 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Disclosure</font></b></p>
      <p>FundsXpress understands that end users of FundsXpress products expect 
        that their financial information and transactions will be handled in a 
        confidential manner. We do not use confidential consumer information for 
        any improper purposes or distribute it to third parties, except as required 
        or permitted by law, or as necessary to provide a contracted service.</p>
      <p>
       
      </p><ul>
        <li> It is the policy of FundsXpress that non-public, personally identifiable 
          consumer information may only be disclosed to third parties when:</li>
        <li>The user, either directly or through our client financial institution, 
          is believed to have requested or authorized the disclosure;</li>
        <li>It is necessary to administer the service or complete a transaction, 
          such as bill pay; or</li>
        <li>It is required or allowed by law (such as, but not limited to, 
          responding to a subpoena or court order, reporting information to legal 
          authorities, regulatory agencies, or other appropriate investigators 
          in connection with a legal investigation or similar matter).</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p> 
      <p>We contractually require our third party service providers to protect 
        the confidentiality of the non-public consumer information received from 
        FundsXpress. Third party service providers are only permitted to use such 
        information for the purpose for which it was provided, such as for bill 
        payments.</p>
      <p>FundsXpress does provide marketing services and support to our clients 
        in order to promote and market our products to the end-users. We may provide 
        aggregate and/or consolidated end-user information to our clients to assist 
        in marketing financial institution products and services. This service 
        is part of the financial services package that we offer each client. Our 
        marketing efforts are coordinated with each client financial institution 
        and because of this, our clients are aware of and involved with any joint 
        marketing ventures. We do not disclose any nonpublic, personally identifiable 
        end-user information with any third party advertising firms.</p>
      <p> <b><font color="#003366">4. Security Features</font></b></p>
      <p><b><i> End-User Security<br>
        </i></b>FundsXpress utilizes a comprehensive security strategy to protect 
        user accounts and transactions conducted over the Internet. We use the 
        SSL (secure socket layer) <a href="security.htm"><b>encryption</b></a> 
        technology for all communications with the end-user. The communication 
        is encrypted every time an end-user enters an access ID, passcode, or 
        personal information during an application or registration process. All 
        financial transactions conducted by end-users are SSL encrypted. In addition, 
        our servers have been certified by a "Certificate Authority" 
        that will assure your customers and members that they are actually talking 
        to our servers instead of someone pretending to be us.</p>
      <p><b><i>Internal Security</i></b></p>
      <p>The architectural design of the system, the data center, policies, 
        procedures, staff, hardware, and software selected for the FundsXpress 
        systems are chosen with security in mind so that all transactions and 
        customer information will be safe and secure. Internal security features 
        include our Kerberos authentication software, Triple Des Encryption, routers/firewalls, 
        and real-time intrusion detection devices. Our new products will incorporate 
        the latest security features and advanced technologies on the market.</p>
      <p>Our secure data center protects our equipment, software, employees, 
        as well as customer, member, and visitor information. We have established 
        policies and incorporated many internal security systems that are designed 
        to minimize our employees’ ability to access personal information relating 
        to the end-users. We perform background checks on our employees, require 
        them to sign non-disclosure agreements, and we restrict access to consumer 
        information so that only authorized employees can access the information 
        that is necessary to provide the contracted products and services to our 
        clients and their end-users. All information collected from our site visitors 
        is also securely stored with limited employee access.</p>
      <p>We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that 
        comply with federal standards to guard customer information. However, 
        despite all our efforts related to security, like any other technology-based 
        system, a security breach may occur. Technology relating to Internet security 
        is evolving rapidly, as are ways to circumvent that security. Although 
        we use state of the art security measures and take every reasonable effort 
        to stay abreast of developments in Internet security, there is always 
        the possibility that someone will find a way to gain unauthorized access 
        to any system, including ours.</p>
      <p><b><i>Our clients should contact the FundsXpress customer service 
        department immediately if an unauthorized access is identified, even if 
        there does not appear to be any loss involved.</i></b></p>
      <p>It is the policy of FundsXpress to investigate all such matters promptly 
        and report intrusion attempts to the proper authorities. Electronic theft 
        is a crime, and if we suspect that someone has attempted or perpetrated 
        it, we would like to have your cooperation in taking the appropriate, 
        remedial measures. In-depth information on many of the techniques and 
        features employed by the system are detailed under our discussion of <b><a href="security.htm">security</a></b> 
        elsewhere on this Web site.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#003366">5. A Word About Cookies</font></b></p>
      <p>A cookie is a very small text file sent by a Web server and stored 
        in your computer’s or browsers’ memory so that it can be read back later. 
        Cookies cannot "read" information about you from your hard drive 
        or be used to "steal" information about you. Cookies are a basic 
        way for a server to identify the computer you happen to be using at the 
        time, not you personally. Cookies are used for many things from personalizing 
        start up pages to facilitating online purchases. Cookies do perform a 
        very important function when you engage in secure Internet banking.</p>
      <p>FundsXpress uses cookies in our products for security, statistics, 
        and enhanced functionality. For example, with our Internet Banking product, 
        we use encrypted cookies to identify the end-user’s computer while they 
        are logged on. When a user logs on to the Internet Banking system, we 
        send the user a cookie that enables us to process multiple transactions 
        during the session without having to provide an access ID and passcode 
        for each individual transaction. Users must accept this cookie to use 
        the FundsXpress Internet Banking product. When the user logs off, or after 
        ten minutes of inactivity, the cookie is no longer accepted and must be 
        renewed by requiring the passcode to be reentered. A new cookie is used 
        for each session. That way, no one can use the prior cookie to access 
        the user’s account.</p>
      <p>We use several cookies to provide features within our Portal and 
        dynamic Web sites. Portal cookies are also used for security purposes and 
        to collect general statistical information on all visitors. Portal cookies 
        enable registered users to customize certain features, such as their stock 
        portfolio and local weather. Portal cookies also enable the users to bypass 
        the login process each time they revisit the Portal. These cookies only 
        contain a unique user identification number and do not contain or collect 
        any personally identifiable information. Users must accept some of the 
        Portal cookies in order to view site.</p>
      <p>When we host financial institution Web sites, we also use a cookie 
        to collect the same type of general information that we collect on this 
        Web site. This information is collected for security and statistical purposes.</p>
      <p>We do not disclose general information collected through cookies 
        with any third party; however, we may provide consolidated, non-personally 
        identifiable information to our clients, such as the most frequently accessed 
        pages within a Web site and/or Portal, or the most frequently used browsers.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#003366">6. Links</font></b></p>
      <p>FundsXpress has a number of links to other sites. These are offered 
        as a courtesy and a convenience to our visitors and clients. FundsXpress 
        assumes no responsibility for the content, reliability, safety, security, 
        or privacy practices of any such site or any transactions with respect 
        thereto. If you have questions or concerns about any other site’s policy 
        regarding these matters, you should contact that site or its sponsor.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#003366">7. Amendments and Changes</font></b></p>
      <p>FundsXpress reserves the right to amend or change this policy at 
        anytime. The most current version of this policy will always be posted 
        on our Web site. The effective date and version number will always be clearly 
        displayed. This policy is for our Internet audience and our clients and 
        does not constitute a contract nor does it modify or amend any agreement 
        we have with our clients. The examples provided within this policy are 
        not exclusive.</p>
