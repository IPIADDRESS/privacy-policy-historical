					<p>funpicplanet respects the privacy concerns of the 
users of its Internet Sites ("Sites"), and has created this privacy statement to explain what information we gather from your visit to our Sites, and how such information 
may be used. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Use of Information </strong><br>
As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as your name or address, is automatically collected from your visit to 
funpicplanet. However, certain non-personal information is recorded by the standard operation of funpicplanet's Internet servers. Information such as the type of browser 
being used, its operating system, and your IP address is gathered in order to enhance your online experience. For example, it may be used to tailor content and 
advertising to your interests. <br>
In special cases, funpicplanet may disclose user information when there is reason to believe that disclosing this information is 
necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to, or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with, 
funpicplanet's rights or property, other funpicplanet web site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Security for all personally </strong><br>
identifiable information is extremely important to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to 
protect your personal information, funpicplanet cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online forms, and you do so at 
your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. 

</p>
<p>
<strong>Use of Cookies </strong><br>
Cookies are pieces of information that <br>
a website transfers to an individual's computer hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies are used to track visits to our Sites and to personalize the Sites for 
new and current subscribers. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies; however, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie 
is being sent. (Note: you will need to consult the help area of your browser application for instructions.) If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to 
accept a cookie, some parts of funpicplanet's web sites may not function properly. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Use of IP Addresses </strong><br>
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your <br>
computer by your Internet provider whenever you surf the Web. When you request pages from funpicplanet Sites, our servers log your IP address. funpicplanet collects 
IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our Site. We may use your IP addresses 
in cooperation with your Internet provider to identify you if we deem it necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or to protect our service, Sites, customers, 
or others.
</p>
