        Certain non-personal information of users is recorded by the standard 
        operation of the FUNimation's Internet servers. Such information is used 
        to make your visits to our sites easy and enjoyable. Other uses of this

        not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent. 
        FUNimation, may however, disclose user information in special cases when 
        we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary 
        to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be 
        causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) 
        FUNimation's intellectual property rights or the rights of other FUNimation 
        site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Further, 
        FUNimation may disclose user information when we believe in good faith 
        that the law requires it. </font></p>

        or otherwise transferred to a third party, except FUNimation may provide 
        this information in an aggregate form to third parties for marketing, 
        advertising or other uses. FUNimation needs to collect this information 
        for fulfilling prizes, tracking/verifying compliance with FUNimation policies

        our fans' use of our sites to enhance our user enjoyment of our sites.<br>
