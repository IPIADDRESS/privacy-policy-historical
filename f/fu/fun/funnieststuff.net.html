  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>


  <p> Funniest Stuff has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and the protection of your personally identifiable information at the Funniest Stuff's website.  To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our personal information collection and use practices and the choices that you can make concerning the use of your personal information.

  Funniest Stuff sends all new members a welcome email message to verify and confirm their registration 
  in our network.  Funniest Stuff also uses the emails it collects to send daily "Funny Video of the Day" newsletters.  Funniest Stuff does not sell or provide the emails it collects to 3rd parties.  Funniest Stuff stores its records in the United States of America but may perform some of its data processing outside of the United States of America. We will protect your information no matter where we process or store your data.</p>
  
  <p>You may occasionally receive quality special offers from our online partners, strictly without obligation of course,
 and only where you have opted in to do so. We will not release your personal information or email address to any other party,
 unless required to by law or unless you receive Funniest Stuff content via a co-branded "private-label" partnership.
 In that case, the private-label partner may also receive personal information about you and we encourage you to review that site's privacy
 policy as well.</p>

      protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of members' information. We use
      industry standard procedures and processes to safeguard the confidentiality
      of your personal information, such as firewalls, encryption, token authentication,
      application proxies, monitoring technology, and adaptive analysis of network
      traffic to track abuse of our network and its data.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, when you submit information
      about yourself to Funniest Stuff over the Internet the information may travel
      over many systems that are not under the control of Funniest Stuff . To prevent
      unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use
      of information, we have put in place appropriate and typical physical,
      electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information
      we collect online.</p>
  <p>All employees, contractors and other companies
     engaged by Funniest Stuff for work that involves access to personal information
      are contractually required to keep the information confidential and not
      to use it in any way other than what is necessary to perform their work
      for Funniest Stuff .</p>

      at our website from members known to be under 18, and no part of our website
      is designed to attract anyone under 18. It is important to remember that
      Funniest Stuff cannot always determine that a member is a child under the age
      of 18. Members under the age of 18 must have written parental consent to
      release their name, email address, or other personal information.</p>
