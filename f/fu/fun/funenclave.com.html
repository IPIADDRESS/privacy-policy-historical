FunEnclave has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our
commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and
dissemination practices for this Web site:<br> <b>www.FunEnclave.com</b><br> <br> <br> <br> <b>What constitutes FunEnclave.com</b><br>
For all purposes, FunEnclave.com refers to the domain www.funenclave.com and
all of its directories and sub domains. This privacy policy is applicable at
all such areas that fall under the domain of "funenclave.com". Individual
sections of this website might be covered separately as an add-on to this privacy policy.<br> <br> <br> <b>Right to Change Policy </b><br>
As FunEnclave.com is constantly innovating and enhancing the type of services
it provides to its users, this Privacy Statement will also continue to change
to match the services and features we make available. As such, we reserve the
right to change this statement to match the services we provide. If we make any
material change to this statement, we will change the date at the top of this
statement to reflect the effective date of the change. When you visit our site
or use our services and site features, we encourage you to check the date of
this Privacy Statement to ensure you are aware of any updates. However,
regardless of how this Privacy Statement may change or evolve over time,
FunEnclave will not collect or maintain your private and personally
identifiable information without your consent. Further, if you consent to give
us your personal information, we will keep it confidential and will not sell,
license or disclose your personal information to any third party without your
consent in any manner that personally identifies you, unless we are compelled
to do so under the law or to comply with court order. <br> <br> <br> <b>Types of Information We Collect </b><br>
A user can browse this website at two levels. The information gathering
policies of FunEnclave.com depend on the level at which you browse.<o:p></o:p><p></p> <ul type="disc"> <li>As a guest, without registering on the site, you are
     free to browse FunEnclave.com without submitting any personal information
     as a guest where personal information refers to your name, email address,
     your address, phone number or any such information that directly
     identifies you. However, all your activities on this website will be
     logged in a non-personally identifiable manner for statistical purposes by
     our software and/or third party software applications. This information
     helps us to understand browsing habits of our users and is used to plan
     our future strategies vis-a-vis content we put on this website.</li> <li>As a registered member, you are required to provide
     this website at a bare minimum, your email address which is used for
     activating your account and/or for future communication with you. You will
     also be required to provide us with a password and select a nickname that
     will identify you on this site and is used to log you into this website
     and allows you to browse as a registered member. FunEnclave.com does not
     ask for any other information at the time of registration that personally
     identifies you. However, you as a user might chose to provide us any other
     information <i>voluntarily</i> both at the time of registration and subsequently
     while browsing the website.</li> </ul> <br> <br> <b>Voluntary information that FunEnclave.com requests<br> </b>When you register, you are asked to give demographic information (like
birth year, occupation, and gender). We ask you to tell us a little about
yourself so we can better understand the types of people who register. This
information can also be used to provide you with content that may be of
interest to you, and to show you advertisements that are relevant to your
demographic information. FunEnclave.com uses third party ad companies to
display ads on its sites. These ads may contain cookies. While FunEnclave.com
uses cookies in other parts of its sites, the ad companies also use cookies
with the ads displayed, and FunEnclave.com may not have access to the type of information
they log.<br> <br> <br> <br> <b>Information Automatically Logged</b><br>
As and when you visit this website, your IP address is automatically logged. We
will also log via third part software your browsing trends which are used
solely for understanding user demands and planning our future strategy such as
the type of content we should make available for you in future. As such the
information logged when you browse as guest is not personally identifiable. As
a registered member, the information may or may not be associated with your web
identity (which you provided this website when you chose to register on this
website). However, even in this case we never use such information to study
individual trends but to use a collection of data obtained for a multitude of
users for statistical purposes.<br> <br> <br> <b>Children's Online Privacy </b><br>
While this website is open for all to browse and register, we expect and state
at the time of sign up that children below the age of 13 will obtain their
guardian's permission before browsing this website and/or trying to register.
However this website does not make any warranty or claim of protecting the
privacy of children in any other particular way.<br> <br> <br> <b>Password Encryption </b><br>
Please note that registration in our message boards require that you specify a
password for your use. This password is then encrypted by the underlying
software automatically, which means that the neither the staff nor any other
member of FunEnclave has access or knowledge of what your exact password is.
This gives you ample security in case you are using the same password
repeatedly in other sites (which is strongly discouraged). As and when you
request for a new password, you will be asked for your old password. If you
have forgotten your old password you can chose to generate a new one, in which
case the underlying software will generate a new password arbitrarily (note
your old password will not be recovered in its exact form even by this method)
and will automatically send you the same via a email to the email address you
had provided this website at the time of signing up. <br> <br> <br> <b>What are Cookies? Why do we use them? </b><br>
FunEnclave uses browser cookies to facilitate your experience with our services
and site features. These cookies are small sections of code that our server
sends to your browser which it can then store on your hard drive. If you choose
to accept these cookies, they enable us to recognize that your browser has
previously visited and used our site and its services and, based on your
browser's previous visits, assist us with tailoring the information and content
you will receive. An example of the customization allowed by the use of such
cookies is to retain your username and password as part of being a member of
FunEnclave.com and automatically log you in on your next visit to this site
from the same computer you had previously used to log in from. These cookies do
not collect, store or maintain your private, personally identifiable
information other than what you have provided to us at the time of registration
and some other site specific features like "forum discussions last
viewed", "gallery views" etc which are used to enhance your
browsing experience on this website. You do not have to accept these cookies to
visit or use the FunEnclave.com, and you can choose to refuse our cookie,
delete our cookie from your hard drive or turn off the FunEnclave.com cookie at
any time by updating your user profile preferences in your browser. However
please note that enabling the cookies is a must to browse as a registered
member on this website.<br> <br> <br> <br> <b>Information on Advertisers/Sponsors </b><br>
We display unobtrusive ads or buttons on our site from outside advertising
companies. These ads or buttons may contain cookies. While we use cookies in
other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by
our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. <i>All ads
displayed on FunEnclave are not endorsed by us</i>. We do not take any
responsibility for the landing site that a user is taken to when he clicks on
the ad.<br> <br> <br> <br> <b>External Links </b><br>
This site contains links to other sites. Apart from links to TechEnclave,
FunEnclave is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such
Web sites. <br> <br> <br> <b>Public Forums </b><br>
This site makes chat rooms, message boards, and/or other news available to its
users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas
becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to
disclose your personal information.<br> <br> <br> <b>Security </b><br>
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and
alteration of the information under our control. In particular we take all
precautions possible to avoid any hacking either of member accounts or of any
other part of our website. However this does not guarantee complete and foolproof
security. All members are requested <i>to always make backups of all the
information/images etc that they post on this website.</i><br> <br> <br> <br> <b>Postings on Message Boards </b><br>
It is important for you to remain aware that when you provide personal
information (e.g., last name, address, phone number) in a posting on any
message board, that information is available to any other person or user having
access and use of that message board, and may be used by someone in a manner
unintended by you. For that reason, we discourage you from offering any
personally identifying information within a posting to any message board.<br> <br> <b><br>
Private Messaging<br> </b>This website allows a number of member to member messaging options. Any
registered member of this website can use the features provided by these
private messaging options to communicate with other members. However please
note that FunEnclave.com makes no guarantee about the security of the data
communicated. All communications done via the private messaging feature would
be deemed private and confidential and as such only you and/or the people whom
such communication was intended for would have access to the information
therein. FunEnclave.com assumes no role in such communications and they are not
tracked by our staff unless specifically asked to do so by a user complaint or
suspicious activity. In case of abuse, a written complaint to the effect should
be communicated to us via our <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">contact us</i>
form. The staff will take whatever action it deems fit in such a scenario. FunEnclave.com
assumes no responsibility for any wrongdoing/abuse/infringement done via the
private messaging feature.<br> <b><br> <br>
Newsletters and Mails from this website<br> </b>This website utilizes the email address that you provide at the time of
registration to communicate with you. Be default only very important messages,
which include messages that directly impact the member, are sent to him and all
such messages are sent by the administrator. Any member can choose not to receive
such mail by ticking the "receive email from administrators" option
off from his control panel. At the time of registration, and subsequently at
any time in the future, the member has the option of voluntarily opting in to receive
mails from<o:p></o:p><p></p> <ul type="disc"> <li>Other members of this website</li> <li>Monthly(or some other fixed frequency) newsletters from

above are "<i>opt in</i>" and you can at any time choose not to receive
