	other information that might be of interest to you.
	<br><br>
	We reserve the right to disclose your personal information if we are

	If you would like more information about our security procedures, see our
	<a href="security.html">Security page</a>.
	<br><br>
	If you authorize us to send you promotional materials, we may do so

	billing information screens. From time to time we may notify you of 
	special promotions, new products or services, or other information that 
	may interest you. We do not share any information you provide to us,

	No. FunctionFox does not view, analyze, share or otherwise access the 
	proprietary data entered by any of its customers.
	<br><br>
	No employee of FunctionFox is able to access customer information without
	the customer's express permission. Occasionally, a customer may allow access 
	to proprietary information in order to resolve a support or technical 
	difficulty.
	<br><br>
	Only customer service representatives and technicians 
	are able to access customer information once permission has been 
	received from the customer.
	<br><br>
	FunctionFox customer service is located off-site, on a different
	network than is used by all other FunctionFox employees. No other
	FunctionFox employee has access to the customer service network.
	<br><br>
	FunctionFox uses secure servers located off site, to which only our
	technicians have access.
	<br><br>
	Passwords are changed regularly to prevent unauthorized access by
	anyone to any information stored by FunctionFox for its customers.
	<br><br>
	Customers are encouraged to change their passwords and usernames on a
	regular basis.
	<br><br>
	The data storage facility has been designed to provide the highest level
	of security; protection against fire, flood and earthquake; and has full
	power backup.
	<br><br>
	Data is backed up on large servers continuously, and backed up to tape

I thank that little Fox every morning when he greets me upon log-in."<br>Maggie Kerr-Southin<br>Artemis Creative Communications<br><br>"TimeFox allows us to track our time more accurately by removing any/all objections my employees had to entering their time. More accurate time entries leads to better data for future project estimates because we have more accurate historical data. Better estimating leads to higher profitability and happier clients. All this leads to better profits and a happier CEO — me."<br>Shannon Carter<br>Cartis Group<br><br>"I needed a better time tracking system than the manual way we were doing things. I knew we weren't charging for all the "little" things and "quick" tasks like emails etc. We absolutely love your product. Learning to use it was so easy and it makes billing a snap.
