<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>At Fun Stuff Cafe, we recognize that privacy of your personal information is important. Here is information on what types of personal information we receive and collect when you use and visit Fun Stuff Cafe.com, and how we safeguard your information. We never sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
<h3>Log Files</h3>
<p>As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.</p>
<h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
<p>We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.</p>
<p>We also use third party advertisements on Fun Stuff Cafe.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).</p>
<p>You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.</p>
<h3>Third Party Advertising</h3>
<p>We use Google AdSense and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.<br>
Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.<br>
Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/" target="_blank"><strong>Google ad and content network privacy policy</strong></a>.</p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p>
<h3>Third Party Cookies</h3>
<p>In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique â€œcookieâ€ on your browser.</p>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>We do not request any personal information or collect any information that personally identifies you or allows you to be personally contacted. Since we do not collect any personal information on this Web site, we do not share any personal information with any third parties nor do we use any personal information for any purposes.</p>
<h3>External Links</h3>

<h3>Our Commitment To Privacy</h3>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.</p>
<h3>The Information We Collect:</h3>
<p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Fun Stuff Cafe website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are: Name Address, Email address, Phone number, Credit/Debit Card Information (etc.). On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient’s address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are: Name, Address, Phone, Number (etc.)</p>
<h3>The Way We Use Information:</h3>
<p>We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.<br>
We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.<br>
We offer gift-cards by which you can personalize a product you order for another person. Information you provide to us to create a gift-card is only used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person receiving the gift.<br>

For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.<br>
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
