<p>Wyltan Inc (Wyltan), operator of FunTrivia.com, has a firm commitment 
to protect your privacy. 
This Privacy Statement discloses our policies regarding information we 
obtain from you and how we limit and protect the uses to which that 
information is put. <br><br>We are committed to building users' trust and 
confidence in the Internet by promoting the principles of disclosure and 
informed consent. Accordingly, we wish to notify you about: 
<br><br>What information is collected from you through the wyltan.com 
site (the Site).<br><br>How that information may be used, including with 
whom it may be shared.<br><br>Choices you have about collection, use and 
distribution of your information.<br><br>How you can access, update or 
delete your information.<br><br>Security precautions regarding loss, 
misuse or alteration of your information. <br><br>These policies apply 
only to the Site, which consists solely of those web pages we control. You 
should determine what privacy policies apply to other web sites before 
providing information to them. <br><br>If you have questions or concerns 
regarding these policies, or any other aspect of the Site or your use of 
it, please contact us by <a href="/feedback.cfm">clicking here</a>. 
<br><br><b>What 
Information We Collect and How We Collect It</b> <br><br>Through your use 
of the Site, we may obtain various types of contact and user information 
from you, such as your IP (or Internet) address, company and user names, 
email addresses, account and credit card numbers. We also collect and 
store statistics and other information about the online activities of our 
visitors on an aggregated basis. For example, we may track the number of 
people who view each page. <br><br>We obtain information several ways. 
Some is required as part of the registration process. Additional, 
information is gathered through "cookies", which deposit special codes on 
your computer. <br><br><b>How We Use Your Information</b> <br><br>We 
generally use your information only to operate the Site and make your 
experience more efficient, effective and enjoyable. <br><br>As a general 
practice, we do not sell, rent or otherwise give your personally 
identifiable information to any other party, except in limited 
circumstances such as compliance with law or with your permission, as 
noted below. Thus, we would not sell your name, email address or other 
personal information to mass marketers. <br><br>Most uses we make of your 
information are for site administration of your use of the site, such as 
processing and tracking of orders, diagnosing problems with our server, 
identification, security and billing. We may also use this information to 
contact you for operational purposes, such as tracking of orders, and 
notifying you of product updates or new products or editions. <br><br>We 
sometimes share aggregated data with some of our partners. However, none 
of this information identifies you in any way without your consent. For 
example, we may share data that shows that a certain percentage of our 
users buy a certain product, but there would be no identification of 
specific users. <br><br>Only if you consent, will we share personal, 
identifiable data about you to third parties. For example, on particular 
pages where we ask for personal information, we may explicitly tell you 
that the data we ask for may by shared with third parties.   <br><br>There 
are circumstances where we may need to provide individual information to 
others. For example, we may disclose information if we in good faith 
believe it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against 
someone who is violating our Conditions of Use of the Site, breaking the 
law, causing injury to or interference with others or otherwise violating 
the rights of others. We may also disclose information to the extent we 
believe in good faith it is required by law or for administrative and 
other purposes we deem necessary to maintain, service and improve our 
products and service. In all such circumstances, we will limit what 
information we disclose to the extent we believe it to be appropriate. 
<br><br><b>Choices Regarding Collection, Use and Distribution of 
Information - Opting Out and Corrections</b> <br><br>We may send you 
emails or other promotions our vendors or we offer that we believe may be 
of special interest to you. Only Wyltan (or our agents who are required to 
comply with these policies) will send you these materials. If you do not 
wish to receive these materials, you may either modify your account 
preferences to opt out from such promotions, send an unsubscribe email by 
the means indicated in the materials or tell us when we collect 
information from you.
 <br><br>You also have choices 
concerning cookies. Your Internet browser allows you to accept all 
cookies, be notified when a cookie is sent or reject all cookies. However, 
if you reject cookies, we may not be able to customize the content we show 
you or otherwise learn your preferences. There may also be services that 
require the use of cookies. This may negatively affect your Site 
experience. In addition, we may place advertising on the Site that 
originates from outside advertisers or other third parties. In some cases, 
if you click on these advertisements, a cookie may be sent to your 
computer. We do not control these cookies. <br><br><b>Security</b> 
<br><br>Although no use of the Internet is 100% secure, the Site uses 
security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of your 
information under our control. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure 
socket layer) encryption for the encryption of important data such as 
credit card numbers, which makes it difficult for third parties to 
access information on the Site.  <br><br><b>Changes In Policies; Terms and 
Conditions</b> <br><br>We may change these policies from time to time. If 
any such changes materially and adversely affect the use of your 
information, we will generally refer to such changes on the Site for a 
period of time, although our failure to do so will not affect the 
applicability of such changes. Accordingly, we recommend that you check 
back to review these policies from time to time, particularly if you have 
not visited the Site for some time. These policies are also subject to our 
Terms of Use, which are incorporated herein by reference, and we also 
recommend that you review those from time to time. <br>  <br>
