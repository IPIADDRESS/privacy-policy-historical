		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

	  <div id="column-one">
<p>Funambol is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of site visitors,
			    prospects, and customers. We will not sell your personal information to
			    anyone. The information you give us as part of registration will be processed
		      by Funambol and its ASPs within the United States.</p>
                <p>The purpose of this policy is to explain the types of information
                  we obtain from users through the Funambol web site, how the
                  information is obtained, how it is used, how it may be obtained
                  by others, and how its use and disclosure can be restricted.
                  Funambol's web site is governed by the following privacy principles:</p>
                <h2>Principle 1: General Data Collection</h2>
                  <p>Our site automatically gathers certain anonymous traffic information,
                    such as Internet protocol addresses and other numeric codes
                    used to identify a computer. This information is aggregated
                    and does not personally identify you, but it helps us improve
                    the site and the services we offer. For example, we may use
                    IP addresses to monitor site usage to better prepare for
                    anticipated traffic patterns. We may also gather user information
                    that we save on your computer (not on our server) as “cookies” in
                    order to streamline the site experience.</p>

                <h2>Principle 2: Information Requests</h2>
                  <p>Funambol requests personal information from you in order to
                    gather your contact information, such as name, company name,
                    address, phone number, email address, and zip code. Some
                    of this information is optional and you may choose not to
                    provide it. Funambol may use the information to contact you
                    to further discuss your interest in our company and products,
                    to send information regarding product updates, and to send
                    a newsletter. You can opt out of being further contacted
                    by us, or receiving such further information from us by clicking
                    here. Except as stated in this policy or as provided in the
                    Funambol license and services agreement, we do not disclose
                    your personal information to any third party. Funambol reserves
                    the right to maintain information on customers who have violated
                    our license and services agreement.</p>
                <h2>Principle 3: Disclosure</h2>
                  <p>Funambol will not sell your individual Information to any third
                    parties. Funambol does not disclose your personal Information
                    to third parties, except as set forth in this policy and
                    in cases where Funambol, acting in good faith, believes that
                    such action is necessary to: (1) conform to legal </p>
	  </div>		
		
		<div id="column-two">
 <p>requirements
                    or comply with a legal process, such as a search warrant,
                    subpoena, or court order; or (2) protect and defend the rights
                    or property of Funambol; (3) enforce the license and services
                    agreement.</p>
                <h2>Principle 4: Solicitation</h2>
                  <p>By registering at this site, you are authorizing Funambol to
                    email you requested documents, a periodic newsletter, and
                    occasional invitations to attend Funambol partner activities.
                    Funambol will not send you any unsolicited information, including
                    email, if at any time you decide to opt-out of receiving
                    such information by clicking here. However, under certain
                    circumstances, Funambol may be required to send customers
                    updated information about our products.</p>

                <h2>Some frequently asked privacy questions:</h2>
                <h3>What are Cookies?</h3>
                  <p>Cookies are files of information that a web site stores on
                    your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies
                    can make the web more useful by storing information about
                    your preferences on a particular site. Cookies allow web
                    sites to "remember" users across pages of a site
                    and across multiple visits to a site. The use of cookies
                    is an industry standard, and many major web sites use them
                    to provide useful features to their customers. Cookies in
                    and of themselves do not personally identify users, although
                    they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially
                    set up to accept cookies. Cookies cannot damage user files,
                    nor can they read unrelated information from a user's hard
                    drive. If you would prefer, you can set your settings to
                    refuse cookies.</p>
                <h3>Is my personal information secure?</h3>

                  <p>The personal information collected by Funambol is stored in
                    secure operating environments that are not available to the
                    general public. However, no data transmission over the Internet
                    can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, while
                    we strive to protect your personal information, Funambol
                    cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
              you transmit to us.</p>

<h2>Appendix</h2>			  
                <p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any
                time. Any questions regarding this Privacy Policy should be directed
