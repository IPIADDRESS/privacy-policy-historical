<font size="-1">
<p>This Privacy Statement is prepared and entered into in the English language only, whose language shall be controlling in all respects. Any translation of this Privacy Statement into any other language are for reference only and shall have no legal or other effect.</p>

<p>This Privacy Statement describes the data privacy policies of Funambol, Inc. ("Funambol" or "us") for data collected through (1) funambol.com and onemediahub.com (collectively, the "Site", including any successor web sites), and (2) any services (including without limitation to the Funambol portal service) provided through the Site or hosted for Funambol customers on Amazon.com ("Service" or "Services"). Our Services may allow you access to your PIM data, Rich Media data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages or other materials ("Content") from third party sites and applications. Any Content that you provide on or to a third-party site or applications is provided directly to the owner of the site or application and is subject to that party's privacy policy. Our Privacy Statement does not apply to such third party sites or services and we are not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those sites or applications. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other sites and applications that you access. Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Statement shall have the meanings given in Funambol Terms of Use.</p>

<p>Funambol complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Funambol has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

<p><strong>By submitting any information or registering for any Funambol Services, you agree (1) to comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Statement, and (2) that Funambol may process (i.e., collect, use, etc.) your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Statement or the Funambol Terms of Use.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Data according to this Privacy Statement. Personal Data may be processed by Funambol in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less or more stringent.</strong></p>

<h2>1. <span class="mleft">INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</span></h2>

<h3>1.1 <span class="mleft">Generally</span></h3>

<p>As used in this Privacy Statement, PIM Data are your personal information manager files (which include your electronic "rolodex" and calendar). Rich Media data are your picture(s), video(s), file(s) and music. Funambol allows you to submit Personal Data through the Site and the Services. The Funambol Service enables you to upload your PIM Data and Rich Media Data to the Service and to synchronize your PIM Data and Rich Media Data to and from other data stores such as a cellphone, PC, email server, social network site, etc. "Personal Data" is information about you that is personally identifiable to you as well as other non-public information to the extent that it is associated with the foregoing.</p>

<h3>1.2 <span class="mleft">Registration</span></h3>

<p>When you register with Funambol, you submit the following types of Personal Data to Funambol (your "Account Data"): your user name, your email address, and your chosen password.</p>

<h3>1.3 <span class="mleft">Funambol Service, PIM Data and Rich Media Data</span></h3>

<p>When you use the Funambol Service, you upload or synchronize your PIM Data and/or Rich Media Data to Funambol's (or our service provider's) servers. We do not use your PIM Data and/or your Rich Media Data for any purpose other than to provide you the Funambol Service.</p>

<h3>1.4 <span class="mleft">Use of Account Data</span></h3>

<p>We may use your Account Data for license reporting and assessment of service levels; to better understand how our Site and Services are used; to gauge traffic patterns and determine what types of content and services are most popular with users; to contact you with information about Funambol products, services, news and events.</p>

<h3>1.5 <span class="mleft">Cookies and Log Files</span></h3>

<p>We use information that we collect through cookies and log files to understand our users ' preferences and to improve the Site and the Services.<br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of the Site and the Services may not work properly.</p>

<p>In our log files, we collect information such as internet protocol ("IP") addresses, browser type, internet service provider ("ISP"), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. Log file information may be linked to your Personal Data.</p>

<h3>1.6 <span class="mleft">Feedback</span></h3>

<p>If you send Funambol an email or mail (to provide feedback or to ask a question regarding the Site or Services), Funambol will collect any information contained in such communication. Funambol may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve the Services. Funambol will treat the Personal Data in such communication in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</p>

<h3>1.7 <span class="mleft">Anonymous Information</span></h3>

<p>Funambol may use any non-personally identifiable information that it collects or stores (including your feedback, but excluding your Account Data and your PIM Data and Rich Media Data) for any purpose it deems appropriate.</p>

<h3>1.8 <span class="mleft">Children</span></h3>

<p>Individuals under the age of 18 are not permitted to use the Services without the supervision of a parent or legal guardian; (iii) we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from children under the age of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register for an online account or to post personal information through the Services; and (iv) should we learn that someone under the age of 18 has provided any Personal Data to the Services, we will remove that information as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>2. <span class="mleft">COMMUNICATIONS</span></h2>

<h3>2.1 <span class="mleft">Special Offers and Updates</span></h3>

<p>We send new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. We present the option to not receive these types of communications.</p>

<h3>2.2 <span class="mleft">Service Announcements</span></h3>

<p>We may send you service related announcements, including, for instance, when a Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account.</p>

<h3>2.3 <span class="mleft">Tell-a-Friend</span></h3>

<p>If you decide to send a "tell-a-friend" email to another person (when Funambol provides such a feature), we will collect that person's email address in order to send the email. We will also collect your name, email address, and any personal message you decide to include in the email, for the purpose of sending the email with our systems. Unless we note that we may send reminder messages to that person, we will not send additional emails to that person. In addition, we provide the option to opt-out of such messages as provided in section 2.1 above.</p>

<h2>3. <span class="mleft">DISCLOSURE</span></h2>

<h3>3.1 <span class="mleft">Limited Data Sharing with Third Parties</span></h3>

<p>We may share your Personal Data with third parties in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</p>

<p>You have control over synchronization of your PIM Data and/or Rich Media Data through your account. Our servers will synchronize your PIM Data and/or Rich Media Data with other devices, and may synchronize such data with third party applications, as instructed by you through your account. As noted in the Funambol Terms of Use, it is your responsibility to maintain the secrecy of your password; if another person obtains your password, that person may access and misuse your PIM and/or Rich Media Data.</p>

<p>We may need to provide your Personal Data to third parties to deliver specific services to you (such as hosting services or support services). These third parties are required not to disclose your Personal Data and not to use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by Funambol.</p>

<p>Funambol may share some or all of your Personal Data with its affiliates, in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Statement. If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by Funambol and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Statement.</p>

<p>We may share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information with our business partners but such information is not linked to your Personal Data and is not included in your PIM Data.</p>

<h3>3.2 <span class="mleft">Legal Requirements</span></h3>

<p>Funambol may disclose Personal Data, including, without limitation to, PIM Data and Rich Media Data - if required by a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order, if required by law, or, at its sole discretion, if Funambol deems it necessary to protect the safety of any individual or the general public or to prevent violation of the Terms of Use Agreement or the rights of Funambol or any third party.</p>

<h3>3.3 <span class="mleft">Security</span></h3>

<p>Funambol uses industry standard security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Although we make good faith efforts to protect the storage and transmission of your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee complete security. You should know that unauthorized persons may access your stored Personal Data (including your PIM Data and Rich Media Data) or intercept transmissions of your Personal Data.</p>

<p>Please be aware that, whenever you voluntarily post information to message boards or any other public forums, such information can be accessed by anyone and, if such information includes your contact information, third parties may use it to send you unsolicited communications.</p>

<h2>4. <span class="mleft">LINKS</span></h2>

<p>The Site may contain links to third party sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of other sites.</p>

<h2>5. <span class="mleft">UPDATING PERSONAL DATA</span></h2>

<p>We realize that your Personal Data is subject to change. You may edit your Account Data at any time (provided that it remains accurate) and the PIM Data and Rich Media Data that we store will change whenever you change it (either directly or via synchronization with another data source). If you wish to have Funambol delete your Account Data, you may terminate your account at any time. If you wish to delete your PIM Data and Rich Media Data, you may do so at any time. However, any information deleted from our production servers may remain in our archives or backups.</p>

<h2>6. <span class="mleft">CHANGES TO THE FUNAMBOL PRIVACY STATEMENT</span></h2>

<p>If we change the Privacy Statement, we will post the new Privacy Statement on the Site with a link from the Site's homepage, so that you are always aware of our data privacy practices. Any substantive changes to the Funambol Privacy Statement will be posted 30 days prior to taking effect (for any existing users).</p>
