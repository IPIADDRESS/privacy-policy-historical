<section class="legalSec">
    <h4 class="headings4">iOS or Android Platforms</h4>

    (iOS) and/or "Advertiser ID" (Android)), your geographic location (based on your Internet Protocol ("IP") address), the version of your operating system
    ("OS"), your game platform ID ("GPF ID"), (which is an ID assigned to you that will be used to help associate your identity across multiple platforms) and

    example, IDFA, Advertiser ID, SSAID, MAC address, or IMEI) at any time.
</p>
<p>
    We use this information to assist with understanding trends in usage and for help with tracking and correcting errors. We also use (and may provide to
    third party analytics providers as described below) country-level geographic location information to enforce our Terms of Service, customize the user
    experience and make recommendations to you.

    We may also give you the opportunity to opt-in to location-based services, which utilize a device's GPS coordinates. You may opt-out of these location
    services via the settings on your device.

    information about you or receive information from us in the course of providing or analyzing their services. GREE is not responsible for these
    marketplaces, and is not affiliated with or responsible for the actions of these third parties. You should review these third parties' terms of service and
    privacy policies, which are separate from GREE's.

    <h3 class="headings3">Security</h3>
<p>
    GREE implements reasonable security measures to protect the security of your information and is committed to protect customer information.
</p>
<p>
    It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and that you immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account. If
    you forget the password to your account, the Site allows you to ask for instructions on how to reset your password. When you sign into your account or
    enter payment information (such as a credit card number when purchasing virtual currency), the transmission of that information is encrypted using secure
    socket layer technology ("SSL").
</p>
<p>
    Although GREE takes reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our websites and records, no Internet transmission is completely secure.
    Accordingly, GREE cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We strongly recommend that you take
    steps to keep your personal information secure (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use. If you have questions about
    security, please visit our support page located at <a href="https://games.gree-support.net"><strong>https://</strong>games.gree-support.net</a>
