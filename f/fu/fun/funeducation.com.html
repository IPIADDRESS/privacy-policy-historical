      licensing transactions or provide service to you as a customer of 
      FunEducation, we may require you to provide certain information to us. 
      Common items may include, but are not limited to, your name, address, 
      phone number and credit card number. By providing this information, you 
      are agreeing to allow us to utilize this information to complete all 
      transactions you request through this Site and to disclose that 
      information and details of all such transactions to our subsidiaries, 
      affiliates or necessary payment processors. 
    <a class="sublink" href="#top">
    <img src="../../webgraphics/design/top.gif" style="border-width:0px;height:10px;width:33px;"></a> 
      </p><p>Here is an explanation of the information 
      we gather and how it is used: 
      </p><p><b><a name="reg">REGISTRATION</a></b></p><p>
      The Site's registration form gathers contact 
      information (e.g., your name and address), unique identifiers (e.g., your 
      e-mail address) and demographic information (e.g., your zip code). We use 
      contact information from the registration form to send you important 
      updates about new features on the Site and special offers from our 
      affiliates. Your contact information is also used to get in touch with you 
      if we have a question about your registration. You may opt-out of 
      receiving future mailings; see the Opt-Out Policy below. Demographic and 
      profile data is also collected at our Site. We use this data to tailor 
      your experience at our Site, showing you content that we think you might 
      be interested in and displaying the content according to your preferences. 
      This information is shared with our affiliates on an aggregate basis. 
      <a class="sublink" href="#top">
      <img src="../../webgraphics/design/top.gif" style="border-width:0px;height:10px;width:33px;"></a> 
      </p><p><b><a name="order">ORDER</a></b></p><p>
      The Site uses an order form to request 
      products and services. We collect contact information (e.g., your shipping 
      address), unique identifiers (e.g., your name and telephone number), 
      financial information (e.g., your credit card number), and demographic 
      information (e.g., your zip code). Contact information from the order form 
      is used to process orders and is also used to get in touch with you if 
      there is a question about your order. You may opt-out of receiving future 
      mailings; see the Opt-Out Policy below. Financial information that is 
      collected is used to bill you for products and services. Unique 
      identifiers (e.g., your billing address) are collected to verify your 
      identity and protect against fraud. We keep a purchase history for each 
      user, tracking all purchases made on the Site. We use this information to 
      provide a high level of customer service, help you track your orders and 
      offer personalized products and content that we think you would find 
      helpful. Demographic and profile data is also collected during the 
      checkout process. 
      <a class="sublink" href="#top">
      <img src="../../webgraphics/design/top.gif" style="border-width:0px;height:10px;width:33px;"></a> 
      </p><p><b><a name="contest">CONTESTS AND SURVEYS</a></b></p><p>
      We run contests and conduct surveys on our 
      Site where we will obtain contact information (e.g. your email address) 
      and demographic information (e.g. your zip code). We use contact data from 
      our contests and surveys to send visitors information about our company, 
      to notify winners and award prizes, and to monitor and improve the use and 
      satisfaction of this Site. Participation in these contests or surveys is 
      completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to 
      disclose this information. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; 
      see the Opt-Out Policy below. 
      <a class="sublink" href="#top">
      <img src="../../webgraphics/design/top.gif" style="border-width:0px;height:10px;width:33px;"></a> 
      </p><p><b><a name="special">SPECIAL OFFERS</a></b></p><p>
      We send all new members a welcoming email to 
      verify password and username. Established members will occasionally 
      receive information on products, services, special deals, and a 
      newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the 
      option to not receive these types of communications; see the Opt-Out 
      Policy below.

      </p><p><b><a name="profile">PROFILE</a></b></p><p>
      We store information that we collect through 
      cookies, log files, clear gifs, and third party sources to create a 
      "profile" of your preferences. We tie your personally identifiable 
      information, and your purchasing history, to information in the profile, 
      in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to 
      improve the content of the site for you.&nbsp;

      &nbsp;<br>
      Supplementation of Information <br>
      In order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement 
      the personal information you submitted to us with information from third 
      party sources such as: <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Address Verification<br>
      We use third party software to verify your address, in order to send you 
      future updates, promotions and information. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Enhancement of Profile Information<br>
      We purchase marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing 
      user database, to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent 
      offers in which we think you would be interested. &nbsp;To enrich our Profiles 
      of individual customers, we tie this information to the personally 
      identifiable information they have provided to us.<br>
      We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user 
      movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p><p>
      <b><a name="consent">CONSENT TO THE USE OF THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS</a></b></p><p>
      FunEducation may contract with other third parties to provide various outsourced services to us relating to the Site rather than performing the services itself. For example, we may contract with an email provider to handle the delivery of email messages to you. Likewise, we may contract with a web site hosting provider to host the Site for us. By visiting the Site, you consent to FunEducation providing all information (whether or not personally identifiable) received or collected from you to such third party providers for the purpose of enabling the third party provider to provide these outsourced services to us.  

      </p><p>
      We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our Site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this Site and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit networkadvertising.org.

      </p><p>
      Third parties will protect your information as FunEducation would under the terms of this policy.  We may also share personally identifiable information with third party providers for the purpose of direct marketing, including email marketing. All third parties are bound by applicable laws including, but not limited to the CAN SPAM Act (s.877) of 2003, and are required to be in full compliance of all consumer opt-out rules and regulations.

      <b><a name="cookies">COOKIES</a></b></p><p>
      A cookie is a small text file that is stored 
      on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this 
      site. We link the information we store in cookies to personally 
      identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use both session 
      ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it 
      easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you 
      close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an 
      extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following 
      directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don't have to 
      enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and 
      target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.&nbsp;

      </p><p><b><a name="log">LOG FILES</a></b></p><p>
      As is true of most Web sites, we gather 
      certain information automatically and store it in log files. This 
      information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, 
      internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, 
      date/time stamp, and clickstream data. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to 
      analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around 
      the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a 
      whole. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      We do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable 
      information to track and store testing results.

      </p><p><b><a name="gifs">CLEAR GIFS</a></b> (Web 
      Beacons/Web Bugs)</p><p>We employ a 
      software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that 
      help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is 
      effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar 
      in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web 
      users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard 
      drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the 
      size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may tie the information 
      gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable 
      information. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails 
      have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness 
      of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing 
      campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see 
      "Opt-Out Policy."

      and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email 
      inviting them to visit the Site. We use this information for the sole 
      purpose of sending this one-time email. We do not store, rent, sell or 
      trade these e-mail addresses.&nbsp;

      This Site has security measures in place to

      control. All information is stored in a secure database behind a firewall 
      designed to prevent unauthorized access and none of the information can be 
      retrieved via the Internet.</p><p>
      To provide you with an additional layer of security, all credit card 
      numbers are stored on a computer that is not connected to the Internet. 
      After you type in your credit card number, it is transferred to our secure 
      computer. This computer is not accessible by network or modem and your 
      credit card number is not stored anywhere else except for normal back-ups. 
      In addition, all credit card numbers stored in the secure computer are 
      encrypted as an added security measure.</p><p>
      We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal 
      information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive 
      it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic 
      storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use 
      commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we 
      cannot guarantee its absolute security.
