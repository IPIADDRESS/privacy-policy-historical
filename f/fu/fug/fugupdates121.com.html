    our website in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
    We never knowingly collect or maintain information at or on our website from those
    we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is directed at or structured
    to attract anyone under 13. Visitors younger than 13 years of age may NOT use the
    Downloadious website and software and must LEAVE immediately.

    You understand that by using the Service, you may encounter content that may be
    deemed offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified
    as having explicit language. Nevertheless, you agree to use the Site at your sole
    risk and that Downloadious shall have no liability to you for content
    that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Downloadious

    Downloadious takes reasonable precaution to protect Personal Information

    guarantee that Personal Information will not be subject to unauthorized access,
    Downloadious has physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect
    the Personal Information. Personal Information is protected by secured networks
    and access is limited to a few authorized employees and personnel. However, no method
    of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure,
    however.
</p>
<h3>
    Changes to Policy</h3>

    From time to time, Downloadious may revise this Policy. Downloadious
    will post the revised Policy on the Site, so that users can always be aware of what

    what circumstances such information may be disclosed.
