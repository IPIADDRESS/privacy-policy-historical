    <p>By clicking on “Continue”, you are giving us permission to send you   emails about our offers. If you chose not to receive any more emails,   you can always opt out at any time at the bottom of each email.</p>
    <p>FullMoneySystem.com respects the privacy of every individual who   visits our websites. This privacy statement provides notice of the   standards and terms under which FullMoneySystem.com protects the privacy   of information supplied by visitors to sites on the World Wide Web that   are owned and operated by FullMoneySystem.com, including   FullMoneySystem.com and www.FullMoneySystem.com. This privacy statement   provides notice of our information collection practices and of the ways   in which your information may be used. This policy may change from time   to time, so please check back periodically to review this information.</p>
    <h3><strong>A. Personally-Identifiable Information:</strong></h3>
    <p>FullMoneySystem.com typically receives specific data about its   website visitors only when such information is provided voluntarily,   such as when our visitors request information, purchase or enroll for   services, open a customer support inquiry ticket, provide resume   information for employment opportunities, or send us e-mail. Of course,   some of these activities require that you give us information, such as   when you make a purchase, use a credit card to pay for services, submit   your resume, or request certain types of information. When you provide   personally- identifiable information to FullMoneySystem.com through one   of our websites, it will be used to fulfill your specific request. In   most cases, you will be given the opportunity to select whether you do,   or do not, want FullMoneySystem.com to use this information for   additional purposes. You may also request that FullMoneySystem.com not   use your information by sending an e-mail to admin@FullMoneySystem.com ,   however, FullMoneySystem.com reserves the right, in its discretion, to   send you bulletins and other important information about your   FullMoneySystem.com services. Absent any instructions from you,   FullMoneySystem.com may use information you provide to inform you about   additional services and products offered by the FullMoneySystem.com   family of companies, FullMoneySystem.com authorized agents, and other   goods and services providers with whom FullMoneySystem.com has   relationships and whose offerings might be of interest to you.   FullMoneySystem.com will not, however, sell or trade your   personally-identifiable information unless we are authorized or legally   required to do so, or in the case of imminent physical harm to the   visitor or others. On those FullMoneySystem.com sites where you may   provide FullMoneySystem.com with credit card or other ordering   information via the web, FullMoneySystem.com protects and secures this   information by employing commercially customary web- based security and   encryption protocols, examples of which include Secure Socket Layer   (SSL) and Secure Electronic Transaction (SET). On those sites where you   voluntarily offer any feedback, data, answers, questions, comments,   suggestions, ideas or the like, FullMoneySystem.com will treat that   portion of the information as non-confidential and nonproprietary and,   except as otherwise expressed in this privacy statement,   FullMoneySystem.com assumes no obligation to protect such information   from disclosure.</p>
    <h3><strong>B. Non Personally-Identifiable (Generic) Information:</strong></h3>
    <p>In general, FullMoneySystem.com gathers some generic information   automatically. Generic information does not reveal the identity of the   visitor. It usually includes information about the Internet address   assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors, and the   FullMoneySystem.com sites visited. FullMoneySystem.com gathers this   information for the limited purpose of determining customer service and   website needs. We accomplish this by using certain technologies,   including “cookies” (a technology that can be used to provide the   visitor with tailored information about FullMoneySystem.com services).   FullMoneySystem.com does not combine information collected in this way   with any personally-identifiable information. You can set your browser   to notify you when you receive a cookie and you can refuse it.</p>

FullMoneySystem.com cannot safeguard any   information you disclose in these locations. Additionally,   FullMoneySystem.com websites contain links to sites that belong to third   parties unrelated to FullMoneySystem.com. FullMoneySystem.com cannot   protect any information you may disclose in these sites and recommends   that you review the privacy policy statements of those sites you visit.</p>
