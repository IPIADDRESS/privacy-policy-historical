<p><strong>Our Legal Obligations.&nbsp;</strong>We will comply with the terms of the Isle of Man’s Data Protection Act 2002 (as may be amended or updated from time to time) (the “<strong>Act</strong>”) when processing your personal information. Your personal information may be also processed or transferred by us to other members of our group of companies, our affiliates, our agents and third parties providing services to us, in jurisdictions outside of the Isle of Man and the European Economic Area. In this event we will comply with the terms of the Act which ensure that personal data is only transferred to such jurisdictions which comply with the various ‘adequacy’ requirements for data protection set out in the Act.</p>
<p><strong>What do the Capitalised Terms Mean?&nbsp;</strong>Unless we give them a specific meaning in this Privacy Policy, capitalised terms shall have the meaning given to them in our&nbsp;<a href="/help/faq/terms/">End User Licence Agreement</a>&nbsp;which takes precedence over any conflicting provision of this Privacy Policy.</p><ul>

Agreement:</strong>&nbsp;By using the Service, you (“<strong>User</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>”) agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy as may be amended by us from time to time, save that we will ask you separately, when you provide us with your details whether you consent to receiving promotional communications from: (a) us; and also (b) third party providers of goods and services with whom we may share your details.&nbsp;<strong>Amendments</strong>: We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any amendment will come into effect immediately upon such change being notified on the Sites. We therefore encourage you to visit this Privacy Policy from time to time to make sure that you are aware of the current version and any changes that we may make.</p>

The name you register with us must be your own name. In addition, it is important that you complete the account details with valid information. You must advise us of any relevant changes to your personal information as provided to us and we do not accept liability for any harm that you may suffer as a result of you failing to notify us of any changes to the personal information that you have provided to us.<strong>&nbsp;Mobile Gambling</strong>: If you wish to use the Service via a Device (as defined in Clause 14 below), you will be required to consent to the use of location-based services by us (or through third parties acting on our behalf) or other operating software information that can be derived from your Device, to detect your geographic location. If you do not permit your location to be known, we will not be able to provide the Service to you using your Device.&nbsp;<strong>Ongoing Data Capture</strong>: In addition, when you use the Service, we capture and store certain personal information including information on your activity on the Sites and information held on the Device(s) you use to allow us to enhance the Service that we provide to you. We also use ‘cookies’ and our ‘cookie’ policy is explained below.&nbsp;<strong>Data Retention:</strong>&nbsp;We retain your personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy which includes any period of historic retention that may be required for regulatory purposes. We do not collect any more personal information from our users than is necessary for our purposes and our data management policies include the deletion of any personal information we no longer require. Should you close (or if we shut down) your Stars Account with us, we will retain your personal data for a period of 6 (six) years to allow us to meet our regulatory and legal obligations and defend ourselves against any claims. Personal information which is not needed for these purposes will be deleted after this period.&nbsp;<strong>Purposes:</strong>&nbsp;We, members of our Group of companies, our affiliates and third parties providing services to us or to you on our behalf will use your personal information for the purpose of conducting our business and providing the Service to you. Specifically, this includes the following purposes (but we also reserve the right to use your personal information for any other purposes that are reasonably ancillary to the business of providing you with the Service):</p><ul>
<li>to process transactions relating to the purchase of Virtual Chips;</li>
<li>to assess your activity for responsible gaming purposes;</li>

<li>to confirm your geographic location.</li>
</ul><p>^ <a href="/poker/room/privacy/#top">Back to Top</a></p><a name="conditions" id="conditions"></a><h2>Conditions for Processing Personal Information</h2><p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Conditions</strong>: We will process your personal information for a variety of reasons, each of which is prescribed by relevant data protection laws.</p>

On occasion we may ask for your consent to processing personal information in a discrete manner, in this instance your personal information will be processed in accordance with such consent and you will be able to withdraw this consent in writing at any time. By way of example, your consent will be needed in order to send you marketing and promotional communications.</p>
<p><strong>Fulfilment of a contract, compliance with a legal obligation</strong></p>
<p>It may also be necessary for us to process your personal information where it is necessary for the performance of a contract (such as the&nbsp;<a href="/help/faq/terms/">End User Licence Agreement</a>&nbsp;when you open a Stars Account) or in order for us to comply with our various legal and/or regulatory responsibilities</p>
<p><strong>Legitimate interests</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we may also process your personal information where we deem such processing to be in our legitimate interests and provided always that such processing will not prejudice your interests, rights and freedoms. Examples of us processing in accordance with legitimate interests would include: (i) where we disclose your personal information to companies in our Group following a restructure or for internal administrative purposes; (ii) where we identify certain companies that can offer you additional benefits to our Service or provide us with valuable information about your use of our Service; (iii) monitoring , detecting and collating information for social responsibility purposes; (iv) processing for the purposes of ensuring network and information security, including preventing unauthorised access to our electronic communications network; (v) adhering to regulatory and statutory requirements; (vi) subject to availability, devising a tailored reward scheme for players.</p>
