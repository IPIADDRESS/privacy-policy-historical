                    <p>For Users of a FullStory Customer, FullStory is acting as a service provider to the Customer for the FullStory Services. FullStory collects information on a User under the direction of its Customer, and has no direct relationship with the User whose information it processes.

                    <p>We will never sell your data to third parties. However, in the course of business, we may hire third party individuals and organizations to help us make the FullStory Services better. These third parties include our web host provider, other SaaS providers, such as an email hosting service, payment processors or outside contractors we hire to perform maintenance or assist us in securing our website. We may also hire third parties to operate, maintain, repair, or otherwise improve or preserve our website or its underlying files or systems.</p>
                    
                    <p>FullStory will may disclose Personal Information and Potential PII only to those of its employees and third party organizations that (1) need to know such information in order to process it on FullStory’s behalf or to provide services as described above and (2) have agreed not to disclose it to any other parties without FullStory’s consent. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Site and/or the Service, you consent to the transfer of information to such individuals and organizations in order to accomplish these purposes.</p>
                    
                    <p>Before using or sharing your information with non-agent third parties in ways not discussed here or previously authorized by you, we will provide you Notice and an opportunity to control the further use or disclosure of your personal information.</p>
                    
                    <p>FullStory has potential liability in cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield. (See below).</p>
                    
                    <p>If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, FullStory may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with FullStory and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. FullStory takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of Personal Information and Potential PII.</p>
                    
                    <p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. If we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information and Potential PII as set forth in this policy. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information and Potential IP, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information and Potential IP.</p>
                    
                    <h4 id="release-of-your-information-for-legal-purposes">Release of Your Information for Legal Purposes</h4>
                    
                    <p>We may access or release Personal Information about you when required to do so in order to comply with any applicable, laws, regulations, subpoena or enforceable governmental or public authority request, including, to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also access or release Personal Information when we have a good faith believe that such access or release is reasonably necessary to (i) enforce applicable terms of service, including investigation of potential violations, (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iii) respond to user support requests, or (iv) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.</p>
                    
                    <h4 id="right-to-access-edit-and-remove-your-information">Right to Access, Edit, and Remove Your Information</h4>
                    
                    <p>You have a right to access personal information we hold about you. Whenever you use our Site or FullStory Services, we strive to make sure that the Personal Information is correct. If that information is wrong, we give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your Personal Information, we may ask you to verify your identity before making any changes. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems). Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. Because we protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, even after information is deleted from the FullStory Services, it may not be immediately deleted from FullStory’s servers.</p>
                    
                    <p>To request removal of your Personal Information from our Site, Services, blog or social media, contact us at privacy@fullstory.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
                    
                    <p>If a User interacts with one of our Customers and the User seeks to access, or correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data or no longer wants to be contacted by one of our Customers, the User should direct its inquiry to the Customer because the Customer is the data controller. If the Customer requests FullStory to remove the Personal Information, we will respond to their request within 30 days.</p>

                    <p>We take measures to enhance the security of our Site and the FullStory Service. These measures include using SSL Certificates and two-factor authentication. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. No security measures are perfect and we cannot promise that the information about you will remain secure in all circumstances.</p>

                    <h4 id="how-fullstory-collects-information">How FullStory Collects Information</h4>
                    
                    <p>Cookies are small data files placed on your computer by the websites you visit and the emails you read and can be used to help recognize you when you return to a website, or when you visit other sites. We, or third party service providers, may use cookies to, among other things, measure activity, personalize your experience, remember your viewing preferences, or track your status or progress when accessing our site. For some of these purposes, our cookies may be tied to Personal Information and/or Potential PII. In particular, the FullStory Services use first-party cookies to maintain a coherent scope for a user session across multiple pages on a single website. These cookies do not track the same user across unrelated domains and, as described above, attempts to infer identity across domains is strictly prohibited.</p>
                    
                    <p>Local Storage is a standard facility provided by HTML5-compliant browsers used to retain data on your computer across visits to the same website. We use local storage as a temporary holding area for user events that were observed locally but, due to the timing of a page unload, were unable to be transmitted as part of the user session. Return visits to the same website read and transmit events previously stored in local storage to complete previously recorded sessions.</p>
                    
                    <p>This information may in the aggregate identify a User, however we will not identify a User as they browse the web if the User turns off cookies, as explained below.</p>
                    
                    <p>FullStory does not and will not ever attempt to identify the same person across disparate, unrelated domains. It is a violation of our Acceptable Use Policy for our customers to attempt to build multi-site user profiles for the intent of selling or exchanging lists of users or demographic information.</p>
                    
                    <h4 id="opting-out">Opting Out</h4>
                    
                    <p>If you wish to prevent all websites using the FullStory Services to be able to record an its activity, you can <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/optout">opt-out</a> of the FullStory Services. Opting out will create a cookie that tells FullStory to turn off recording on any site which uses the FullStory Services. The presence of this cookie is required to continue opting out, so if you clear your browser cookies, you will have to opt-out again. (We regret that there isn't a better way to make your opt-out more permanent, but due to technical reasons, this really is the best we can do at present.)</p>
                    
                    <h4 id="one-more-thing">One more thing.</h4>
                    
                    <p>If you are considering opting-out, it's probably a good time to make sure you really understand that the purpose of the FullStory Services is to help well-intentioned companies make their website better for you. It is emphatically not one of those we-track-you-around-the-web kind of deals. We think that's creepy, too.</p>
                    
                    <p>Most people who make websites are just like you: nice people who want to do a good job and make something awesome. And you wouldn't believe how much time and energy product teams spend trying to make their websites great for you. Without the FullStory Services, though, they simply do not have enough information to understand when they get it wrong. If they can see how you actually experience their website, like an ongoing usability study, they'll actually know what to improve! They don't need to record anything sensitive in order to do that, and we have a strict <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/legal/acceptable-use">Acceptable Use Policy</a> where you can see for yourself the high standards we expect of FullStory customers with respect to your privacy.</p>
                    
                    <h4 id="blocking-cookies">Blocking Cookies</h4>
                    
                    <p>If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete individual or all of the cookies on your computer by following your browser’s help file directions. Note that turning off cookies may also disable functions of many websites you visit. If your browser is set to reject cookies or you manually delete cookies, FullStory will not be able to coalesce your anonymous user identity automatically into sessions across pages on the same website.</p>
                    
                    <p>FullStory could in principle coalesce your user identity across pages of a single website even if you are blocking cookies if (1) you are logged into the website of a FullStory customer and (2) that customer uses the <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/docs/developer#customdata">JavaScript API</a> to identify you using an application-unique identifier.</p>
