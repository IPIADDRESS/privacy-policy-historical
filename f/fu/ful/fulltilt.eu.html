The name you register with us must be your own name. In addition, it is important that you complete the account details with valid information, since it will be used in the course of validating financial transactions and for the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. You must advise us of any relevant changes to your personal information as provided to us and we do not accept liability for any harm that you may suffer as a result of you failing to notify us of any changes to the personal information that you have provided to us.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Mobile Gambling</strong>: If you wish to use the Service via a Device (as defined in Clause 16 below), you will be required to consent to the use of location-based services by us (or through third parties acting on our behalf) or other operating software information that can be derived from your Device, to detect your geographic location. If you do not permit your location to be known, we will not be able to provide the Service to you using your Device.&nbsp;<strong>Ongoing Data Capture</strong>: In addition, when you use the Service, we capture and store certain personal information including information on your activity on the Sites and information held on the Device(s) you use to allow us to enhance the Service that we provide to you. We also use 'cookies' and our 'cookie' policy is explained below.&nbsp;<strong>Data Retention:</strong>&nbsp;We retain your personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy which includes any period of historic retention that may be required for regulatory purposes. We do not collect any more personal information from our users than is necessary for our purposes and our data management policies include the deletion of any personal information we no longer require. Should you close (or if we shut down) your Stars Account with us (but excluding where your account is self-excluded), we will retain your personal data for a period of 6 (six) years to allow us to meet our regulatory and legal obligations and defend ourselves against any claims. Personal information which is not needed for these purposes will be deleted after this period.&nbsp;Please note that information relating to self-excluded accounts will not be deleted and will be retained for much longer than the specified periods above in compliance with our regulatory obligations. <strong>Purposes:</strong>&nbsp;We, members of our Group of companies, our affiliates and third parties providing services to us or to you on our behalf will use your personal information for the purpose of conducting our business and providing the Service to you. Specifically, this includes the following purposes (but we also reserve the right to use your personal information for any other purposes that are reasonably ancillary to the business of providing you with online gambling services):<br>
<ul>
<li>to confirm financial transactions;</li>
<li>to analyse your credit and fraud risk and verify your credentials using third parties, including financial institutions, identification verification agencies and credit reference agencies;</li>
<li>to assess your gambling activity for responsible gaming purposes;</li>
<li>to verify whether you have registered with any mandatory self-exclusion bodies (as may be applicable), for responsible gaming reasons;</li>
<li>to provide the Service to you;</li>
<li>identification, verification and vetting purposes;</li>
<li>statistical analysis and research;</li>
<li>research and development;</li>
<li>marketing, market research, customer surveys and customer profiling;</li>

<li>to combat against security risks and fraudulent activity; and</li>
<li>to confirm your geographic location.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol><p>^ <a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p><a name="conditions" id="conditions"></a><h2>Conditions for Processing Personal Information</h2><ol start="3">
<li><strong>Conditions</strong>: We will process your personal information for a variety of reasons, each of which is prescribed by relevant data protection laws.
<p><strong>Consent</strong></p>
<p>Our processing of your personal information will primarily be necessary for us to provide you with the Service. On occasion we may ask for your consent to processing personal information in a discrete manner, in this instance your personal information will be processed in accordance with such consent and you will be able to withdraw this consent in writing at any time. By way of example, your consent will be needed in order to send you marketing and promotional communications.</p>
<p>Please note that we will not share your data with companies outside of our Group for them to use for their own marketing purposes. This restriction does not apply to the Sky Betting and Gaming as we may share your data with them and they may contact you regarding their products and services which fall under our combined Group. Opting out of marketing for any products and services provided by TSG will not affect your marketing preferences on Sky Betting and Gaming.</p>
<p><strong>Fulfilment of a contract, compliance with a legal obligation</strong></p>
<p>It may also be necessary for us to process your personal information where it is necessary for the performance of a contract (such as the <a href="/poker/room/tos/">End User Licence Agreement</a> when you open a Stars Account) or in order for us to comply with our various legal and/or regulatory responsibilities, including, but not limited to, complying with the conditions of our gambling licences and complying with any anti-money laundering legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Legitimate interests</strong></p>
<p>Finally,&nbsp;we may also process your personal information where we deem such processing to be in our (or a third party's) legitimate interests and provided always that such processing will not prejudice your interests, rights and freedoms. Examples of us processing in accordance with legitimate interests would include: (i) where we disclose your personal information to companies in our Group following a restructure or for internal administrative purposes; (ii) where we identify certain companies that can offer you additional benefits to our Service or provide us with valuable information about your use of our Service; (iii) detection and retention of information pertaining to those with responsible gambling issues. Note that if you self-exclude yourself on any of our Sites for responsible gaming reasons, such restrictions shall not automatically extend to or be replicated on accounts that you may hold with Sky Betting and Gaming (as may be applicable). Nonetheless, we may share information about your self-excluded status within the Group in order to help with the identification of individuals who may be at risk of problem gambling and may take suitable action where necessary; (iv) processing for the purposes of ensuring network and information security, including preventing unauthorised access to our electronic communications network; (v) safeguarding the integrity of sports by combating suspicious betting patterns as well as reporting and sharing information related to such patterns; (vi) adhering to regulatory and statutory requirements; (vii) devising a tailored reward scheme for players.</p>
