		<h1>Full Slate Privacy Policy</h1>
		<h3><small>Effective Date: October 21, 2013</small></h3>

		<p>At <b>Full Slate</b>,
		we respect your right to privacy and we understand that users need to control
		the uses of their personal information. Full Slate (“Full Slate”, “we”,
		“us” or “our”) owns and operates various websites and internet-based
		applications that facilitate appointment scheduling, customer relationship
		management, marketing, promotions, and resource management (collectively, the
		“Services”) for service providers and their clients. This privacy policy describes
		our policies with respect to personal information we receive from businesses
		and individuals who provide services (“Service Providers”), from individuals
		who use the Services to schedule appointments and otherwise interact with Service
		Providers (“Clients”), and from visitors to our websites.</p>

		<h2>Information Collection &amp; Use</h2>

		<h3>Clients</h3>

		<p>You may schedule an appointment with a
		Service Provider whether or not you register with us. If you do not register,
		you will use the Services as a “guest”, in which case you will be required to
		enter 1) your name and 2) your email address, phone number, or both, as
		determined by the Service Provider with whom you are scheduling an appointment,
		and you may also be asked for other information. If you register, you will be
		required to enter your name, email address (which will function as your user
		name) and password, and will also be asked for your phone number, address, and
		other information. Full Slate and the Service Provider with whom you schedule
		an appointment use this information to send you appointment confirmations and reminders,
		to otherwise communicate with you about such services, and to inform you about
		the services in which you have expressed interest.</p>

		<h3>Service Providers</h3>

		<p>In order to use the Services, you must first
		complete the registration process and create a user name and password.  During
		registration you are required to give contact information including, but not
		limited to, business name, owner, address, phone number and email address. We
		use this information to contact you about the Services and about services in
		which you have expressed interest. If you or a representative of your business
		sends us an email or otherwise provides us an email address, we reserve the
		right to retain that email address. In order to market your business, we may
		also ask you for additional information, such as toll-free number and directory
		categories. We will use the foregoing information to contact you in support of
		delivering the Services to you, to improve or optimize the Services, and to
		ensure you are a valid business using the Services in accordance with the
		Full Slate Terms of Use. If you achieve the Payment Threshold, as defined in the
		Terms of Use, you will be required to enter credit card information in order to
		keep your account active. We will use this information solely for billing your
		credit card for the Services.</p>

		<p>We will not share your schedule with anyone except as
		necessary for Clients to browse and schedule appointments. If you directly
		enter information about Clients, we will not share such information or market
		to such Clients unless they separately opt-in during registration.</p>

		<h3>Surveys</h3>

		<p>From time to time, we may provide you the opportunity
		to participate in surveys about the Services.  If you participate, we will
		request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in
		these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether
		or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically
		includes contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic
		information (such as zip code). We use this information to improve or optimize
		the Services and to provide Service Providers with aggregate information that
		may help them better operate their business.  We may use a third party service
		provider to conduct these surveys; that company will be prohibited from using
		our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will
		not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a survey
		with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>

		<h2>Communications from the Services</h2>

		<h3>Clients</h3>

		<p>We will send you appointment confirmations and reminders based on information you
		provide when you schedule an appointment. Further, the Service Provider with
		whom you schedule an appointment may contact you with any changes to, or
		questions about, the appointment and related services. If you choose to
		register with Full Slate, we may send you a welcome email to verify your user name/email
		address. The Service Provider with whom you schedule an appointment may
		occasionally send you information on their services. Out of respect for your privacy, we will give you the option not to receive
		these types of communications.  Please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section.</p>

		<h3>Service Providers</h3>

		<p>If you choose to register with Full Slate, we will
		send you a welcome email to verify your user name/email address. We will send
		you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do
		so.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we
		might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these
		communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to
		receive them, you have the option to terminate your account. We will also
		communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you
		request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or
		telephone, in accordance with your wishes. We will occasionally send you
		information on new services or features.  Out of respect for your privacy, we
		present the option not to receive these types of communications.  Please see
		the “Choice and Opt-out” section.</p>

		<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

		<h3>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</h3>

		<p>We share aggregated demographic information about our
		user base with our current and/or prospective partners, including online
		directories and businesses that help Service Providers market their business. 
		This information does not identify individual users. We do not link aggregate
		user data with personally identifiable information.</p>

		<h3>Client Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

		<p>We will share your Personally Identifiable
		Information with the Service Provider with whom you schedule an appointment so
		the Service Provider can contact you regarding the appointment.</p>

		<h3>Service Provider Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

		<p>We will share your information with Clients to the
		extent it is necessary to schedule appointments and otherwise interact with you.
		We use a credit card processing company to bill you for services. This company
		does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for
		any other purposes. We use third parties to provide directory listings and
		marketing services on the Services. When you sign up for these services, we
		will share information about your business as necessary for the third party to
		provide that service. These third parties may contact you via phone or email
		about your business listing and to offer you additional services.</p>

		<h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>

		<p>We reserve the right to disclose
		your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe
		that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a
		judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on the Services.</p>

		<h2>Choice and Opt-out</h2>

		<p>If you are a Client, you can opt-out of receiving certain messages by contacting the Service Provider with whom you’ve scheduled an appointment or have a business relationship. If you have registered for a Full Slate account and wish to cancel it, you can contact us at support@fullslate.com. If you are a Service Provider and do not wish to receive promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in  such communications or by emailing us at support@fullslate.com.</p>

		<h2>Log Files</h2>

		<p>As is true of most websites, we gather
		certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information
		includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service
		provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and
		clickstream data. We use this information to administer and provide customer support for the Services,
		to analyze trends and track users’ movements
		around the Services and to gather demographic information about our user base
		as a whole. We use a third-party tracking service called Google
		Analytics that uses log files to track non-personally identifiable information
		about visitors to our site in the aggregate, such as usage and volume
		statistics, which we use to improve and enhance the Services.</p>

		<h2>Cookies</h2>

		<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a
		user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on the Services. We
		link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable
		information you submit while on the Services. We use both session ID cookies
		and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to
		navigate the Services. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.
		A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
		You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your
		Internet browser’s “help” file. We set a persistent cookie to store your
		passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once.  Persistent cookies
		also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
		experience on the Services. If you reject cookies, you may still use the
		Services, but your ability to use some areas of the Services
		will be limited. Some of our business partners may use cookies on the Services.
		 We have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>

		<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

		<p>The Services contain links to other sites that are not
		owned or controlled by Full Slate. Please be aware that we, Full Slate, are not
		responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to
		be aware when you leave the Services and to read the privacy statements of each
		and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This
		privacy statement applies only to information collected by the Services.</p>

		<h2>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h2>

		<p>If your personally identifiable information changes,
		or if you no longer desire the Services, you may update or delete it by making
		the change on your account or by contacting us at support@fullslate.com.</p>

		<h2>Security</h2>

		<p>The security of your personal
		information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information, such as a
		credit card number, on our payment web pages, we encrypt that information using
		secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry
		standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
		transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the
		Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore,
		while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal
		information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any
		questions about security on the Services, you can send email us at
		support@fullslate.com.</p>

		<h2>Business Transitions</h2>

		<p>In the event Full Slate goes through a
		business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale
		of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information
		will likely be among the assets transferred.  You will be notified via notice
		on the Services of any such change in ownership or control of your personal
		information.</p>

		<h2>Protecting the privacy of children</h2>

		<p>We do not direct the Services to children
		under the age of 13. We respect the privacy of parents and children and are
		committed to complying with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. As
		such, we will promptly delete any information and cancel any account we believe
		to be from children under the age of 13.</p>

		<h2>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h2>

		<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we
		will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem
		appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use
		it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right
		to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.</p>

		<h2>Contact Us</h2>

		<p>If
		you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please
		contact us at support@fullslate.com.</p>
