<p>This policy may be modified from time to time to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our information collection and use practices, the features of our websites, or technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII, those changes will be posted in this Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If we materially change our practices regarding use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change.</p>
