<b><font size="3">VENSURE, INC. PRIVACY POLICY		</font></b>
			
        <p> Vensure, Inc. ("Vensure") 
          respects individual privacy and values the confidence of its customers, 
          employees, vendors, consumers, business partners and others. Vensure strives to collect, use and disclose Personal information in 
          a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which it does 
          business, and has a tradition of upholding the highest ethical standards 
          in its business practices. Vensure abides by the Safe Harbor 
          Principles developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European 
          Commission and the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) issued by the Department 
          of Commerce on July 21, 2000. This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy (the "Policy") 
          sets forth the privacy principles that Vensure follows with 
          respect to transfers of Personal information anywhere in the world, 
          including transfers from the European Economic Area (EEA) (which includes 
          the twenty-five member states of the European Union (EU) plus Iceland, 
          Liechtenstein and Norway) to the United States. </p>
        <p><br>
          <span class="subheader">I. SAFE HARBOR</span></p>
        <p>The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission 
          have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked 
          questions (the "Safe Harbor Principles") to enable US companies 
          to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection 
          be given to Personal information transferred from the EU to the United 
          States. The EEA also has recognized the US Safe Harbor as providing 
          adequate data protection (OJ L 45, 15.2.2001, p.47). Consistent with 
          its commitment to protect Personal privacy, Vensure adheres 
          to the Safe Harbor Principles.</p>
        <p>Vensure has a Chief Privacy Officer who is responsible for 
          Vensure's compliance with and enforcement of this Policy. 
          Vensure also has a Global Director of Data Protection who 
          assists in ensuring compliance with this Policy and data security issues. 
          Vensure educates its employees concerning compliance with 
          this Policy and has self-assessment procedures in place to assure compliance. 
          Vensure's Chief Privacy Officer Barbara A. Sellinger, Global 
          Director of Data Protection William H. Murray, and Corporate Legal Team 
          are available to any of its valued employees, customers, vendors, business 
          partners or others who may have questions concerning this Policy or 
          data security practices. Relevant contact information is provided herein.</p>
        <p class="subheader">II. SCOPE</p>
        <p>This Policy applies to all Personal information received by Vensure in any format including electronic, paper or verbal. Vensure collects and processes Personal information concerning current 
          and former employees and their respective family members, as well as 
          applicants for employment through its Internet websites, its intranet 
          site, electronic mail and manually. Vensure is the sole owner 
          of information it collects from current and former employees, applicants 
          for employment, customers, vendors and others. Vensure will 
          not sell or share this information with third parties in ways different 
          than what is disclosed in this Privacy Policy. On a global basis, Vensure will, and will cause its affiliates to, establish and maintain 
          business procedures that are consistent with this Policy.</p>
        <p>Personal information collected by Vensure from employees 
          and applicants for employment is maintained at its corporate offices 
          in Piscataway, New Jersey in the United States as well as the local 
          office of the employee or applicant. Vensure collects Personal 
          information for, among other things, legitimate human resource business 
          reasons such as payroll administration; filling employment positions; 
          administration and operations of its benefit programs; meeting governmental 
          reporting requirements; security, health and safety management; performance 
          management; company network access; and authentication. Vensure 
          does not request or gather information regarding political opinions, 
          religion, philosophy or sexual preference. To the extent Vensure 
          maintains information on an individual's medical health or ethnicity 
          (as legally required), Vensure will protect, secure and use 
          that information in a manner consistent with this Policy and applicable 
          law.</p>
        <p>Personal information collected by Vensure from prospective 
          customers, consumers, vendors, business partners and others may be maintained 
          at its corporate offices in Piscataway, New Jersey or at other Vensure facilities. Vensure collects Personal information 
          for, among other things, legitimate business reasons such as customer 
          service; product, warranty and claims administration; meeting governmental 
          reporting and records requirements; maintenance of accurate accounts 
          payable and receivable records; internal marketing research; safety 
          and performance management; financial and sales data; and contact information. 
          All Personal information collected by Vensure will be used 
          for legitimate business purposes consistent with this Policy.</p>
        <p class="subheader">III. DEFINITIONS</p>
        <p>For purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
        <p>"Agent" means any third party that uses Personal information 
          provided by Vensure to perform tasks on behalf of or at the 
          instruction of Vensure.</p>
        <p>"Vensure" means Vensure Companies, Inc., 
          its predecessors, successors, subsidiaries, divisions and groups.</p>
        <p>"Personal information" means any information or set of information 
          that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Vensure 
          to identify an individual. Personal information does not include information 
          that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that 
          has not been combined with non-public Personal information.</p>
        <p>"Sensitive Personal information" means Personal information 
          that reveals race, ethnic origin, trade union membership, or that concerns 
          health. In addition, Vensure will treat as sensitive Personal 
          information any information received from a third party where that third 
          party treats and identifies the information as sensitive.</p>
        <p class="subheader">IV. PRIVACY PRINCIPLES</p>
        <p>The privacy principles in this Policy are based on the seven Safe Harbor 
          Principles.</p>
        <p>(1) NOTICE: Where Vensure collects Personal information directly 
          from individuals, it will inform them about the purposes for which it 
          collects and uses Personal information about them, the types of non-agent 
          third parties to which Vensure discloses that information, 
          and the choices and means, if any, Vensure offers individuals 
          for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal information. Notice 
          will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals 
          are first asked to provide Personal information to Vensure, 
          or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before Vensure uses the information for a purpose other than that for which 
          it was originally collected. Vensure may disclose Personal 
          information if required to do so by law or to protect and defend the 
          rights or property of Vensure.</p>
        <p>(2) CHOICE: Vensure will offer individuals the opportunity 
          to choose (opt-out) whether their Personal information is (a) to be 
          disclosed to a non-agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose 
          other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently 
          authorized by the individual.</p>
        <p>For sensitive Personal information, Vensure will give individuals 
          the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to 
          the disclosure of the information to a non-agent third party or the 
          use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which 
          it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.</p>
        <p>Vensure will provide individuals with reasonable mechanisms 
          to exercise their choices should requisite circumstances arise.</p>
        <p>(3) DATA INTEGRITY: Vensure will use Personal information 
          only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was 
          collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Vensure 
          will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal information is relevant 
          to its intended use, accurate, complete and current.</p>
        <p>(4) TRANSFERS TO AGENTS: Vensure will obtain assurances from 
          its Agents that they will safeguard Personal information consistently 
          with this Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided 
          by Agents include: a contract obligating the Agent to provide at least 
          the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor 
          Principles, being subject to EU Directive 95/46/EC (the EU Data Protection 
          Directive), Safe Harbor certification by the Agent, or being subject 
          to another European Commission adequacy finding (e.g., companies located 
          in Switzerland). Where Vensure has knowledge that an Agent 
          is using or disclosing Personal information in a manner contrary to 
          this Policy, Vensure will take reasonable steps to prevent 
          or stop the use or disclosure. Vensure holds it Agents accountable 
          for maintaining the trust our employees and customers place in the company.</p>
        <p>(5) ACCESS AND CORRECTION: Upon request, Vensure will grant 
          individuals reasonable access to Personal information that it holds 
          about them. In addition, Vensure will take reasonable steps 
          to permit individuals to correct, amend or delete information that is 
          demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. Any employees that desire 
          to review or update their Personal information can do so by contacting 
          their local Human Resources Representative.</p>
        <p>(6) SECURITY: Vensure will take reasonable precautions to 
          protect Personal information in its possession from loss, misuse and 
          unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Vensure protects data in many ways. Physical security is designed to 
          prevent unauthorized access to database equipment and hard copies of 
          sensitive Personal information. Electronic security measures continuously 
          monitor access to our servers and provide protection from hacking or 
          other unauthorized access from remote locations. This protection includes 
          the use of firewalls, restricted access and encryption technology. Vensure limits access to Personal information and data to those persons 
          in Vensure's organization, or as agents of Vensure, 
          that have a specific business purpose for maintaining and processing 
          such Personal information and data. Individuals who have been granted 
          access to Personal information are aware of their responsibilities to 
          protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of that information 
          and have been provided training and instruction on how to do so.</p>
        <p>(7) ENFORCEMENT: Vensure will conduct compliance audits of 
          its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Policy and 
          the US Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Principles. Any employee that 
          Vensure determines is in violation of this Policy will be 
          subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.</p>
        <p class="subheader">V. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>
        <p>Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of Personal 
          information should be directed to the Vensure Privacy Office 
          at the address given below. Vensure will investigate and attempt 
          to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal 
          information in accordance with the principles contained in this Policy. 
          For complaints that cannot be resolved between Vensure and 
          the complainant, Vensure has agreed to participate in the 
          dispute resolution procedures of the panel established by the European 
          data protection authorities to resolve disputes pursuant to the Safe 
          Harbor Principles.</p>
        <p class="subheader">VI. INTERNET PRIVACY</p>
        <p>Vensure sees the Internet, intranets and the use of other 
          technologies as valuable tools for communicating and interacting with 
          consumers, employees, vendors, business partners and others. Vensure recognizes the importance of maintaining the privacy of Personal 
          information collected through websites that it operates. Vensure's 
          sole purpose for operating its websites is to provide information concerning 
          products and services to the public. In general, visitors can reach 
          Vensure on the Web without revealing any Personal information. 
          Visitors on the Web may elect to voluntarily provide Personal information 
          via Vensure websites but are not required to do so. Vensure collects information from visitors to the websites who voluntarily 
          provide Personal information by filling out and submitting online questionnaires 
          concerning feedback on the website, requesting information on products 
          or services, or seeking employment. The Personal information voluntarily 
          provided by website users is contact information limited to the user's 
          name, home and/or business address, phone numbers and email address. 
          Vensure collects this information so it may answer questions 
          and forward requested information. Vensure does not sell or 
          share this information with non-agent third parties.</p>
        <p>Vensure may also collect anonymous information concerning 
          website users through the use of "cookies" in order to provide 
          better customer service. "Cookies" are small files that websites 
          place on users' computers to identify the user and enhance the website 
          experience. None of this information is reviewed at an individual level. 
          Visitors may set their browsers to provide notice before they receive 
          a cookie, giving the opportunity to decide whether to accept the cookie. 
          Visitors can also set their browsers to turn off cookies. If visitors 
          do so, however, some areas of Vensure websites may not function 
          properly.</p>
        <p>Few, if any, of Vensure's websites are directed toward children. 
          Nevertheless, Vensure is committed to complying with applicable 
          laws and requirements, such as the United States' Children's Online 
          Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").</p>
        <p>Vensure website users have the option to request that Vensure not use information previously provided, correct information 
          previously provided, or remove information previously provided to Vensure. Those that would like to correct or suppress information they 
          have provided to Vensure should forward such inquiries to:</p>
        <p>Vensure Privacy Inquiries<br>
          1101 Beach Avenue<br>
          Vancouver, B.C. V6E 1V4<br>
<br>
          </p>
        <p>The inquiries should include the individual's name, address, and other 
          relevant contact information (phone number, email address). Vensure will use all reasonable efforts to honor such requests as quickly 
          as possible.</p>
        <p>Vensure websites may contain links to other "non-Vensure" websites. Vensure assumes no responsibility 
          for the content or the privacy policies and practices on those websites. 
          Vensure encourages all users to read the privacy statements 
          of those sites; their privacy practices may differ from those of Vensure.</p>
        <p class="subheader">VII. CHANGES TO THIS SAFE HARBOR PRIVACY POLICY</p>
        <p>The practices described in this Policy are current Personal data protection 
          policies as of June 18, 2004. Vensure reserves the right to 
          modify or amend this Policy at any time consistent with the requirements 
          of the Safe Harbor Principles. Appropriate public notice will be given 
          concerning such amendments.</p>
