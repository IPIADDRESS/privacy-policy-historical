        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>BuySellAds.com Inc. ("Company", "we" or "us") provides advertising technology solutions that enables media companies, online advertisers, and web publishers to buy, sell, and measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. In order to
        accomplish this, we have created and/or manage certain online (including without limitation via websites and their sub-domains) and mobile applications ("App" or "Apps"), ad serving technology and related support and hosting services. (Such Apps,
        technology and services are each referred to as a "Service" and collectively as the "Services").</p>

        <p>We are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy rights of our users, and we created this Privacy Policy to give you notice of how your individual information will (and will not) be used by us. This Privacy Policy provides information on
        our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of such information we receive from (1) companies and individuals who use our Services and (2) visitors who simply browse the Services.</p>

        <p>By using or accessing any of the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, store, process and share your information in
        the following ways.</p>

        <p>Remember that your use of the Services is at all times subject to the <a href="/about/terms">Terms of Use</a>, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Privacy Policy without defining them have the definitions given to
        them in the Terms of Service.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this website. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.</p>

        <h3>1. What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Collect It?</h3>
        <p>At various times, you could be asked to provide information such as your name, email address, contact phone number or other information. Information collected is often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable: </p>

        <p>“Anonymous Information” refers to information that cannot be tied back to identify a specific individual. For instance, we may know that thousands of people have visited this Privacy Policy, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they
        live, or their date of birth. What we collect from visits such as this constitutes Anonymous Information. Some of the individuals who access our Services decline to use the personalization features that are available to them, and therefore those
        individuals are anonymous to us and the only data we collect about them is Anonymous Information.</p>

        <p>“Personally Identifiable Information” refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, email address, or phone number. Using the Services may allow us to "recognize" you to allow us to personalize the Services for
        you.</p>

        <h4>Anonymous Information</h4>
        <p>As is true of most apps and web sites, we gather certain information (such as mobile provider, operating system, etc.) automatically and store it in log files. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends,
        to administer the Services, to track users movements around the Services and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may link some of this automatically-collected data to certain Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

        <h4>Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
        <p>When you register with us via our Services, we may ask you for some Personally Identifiable Information, such as your first and last name, email address, home address, and other information. If you are an advertiser, we need you to provide
        certain billing information, such as credit card, bank account or PayPal information. If you are a publisher of ads, we need you to provide information about your website and payment method, such as bank or PayPal account information. You may
        review and update this Personally Identifiable Information in your profile by logging in and editing such information in your dashboard.</p>

        <p>Some Personally Identifiable Information may also be provided to intermediaries and other Third Party Service Providers (defined in part (4) below) who assist us with the Services, but who may make no use of any such information other than to
        assist us in providing the Services. Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, however, we will not rent or sell your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties.</p>

        <p>If you choose to allow a Service to collect your location data, such location data will be available to us. In addition, if you have an account with Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn or other similar websites (each a "Social Network"), your
        Social Network identity, including your public picture, may be associated with your location data.</p>

        <p>If you send a "Do Not Track" request through your web browser, we may still collect and use your browsing data to improve security, to provide our Services and to generate reporting statistics, but in general we will not track other web sites
        that you may have visited.</p>

        <h4>No Information Collected from Children.</h4>
        <p>We will never knowingly collect any individual information from children under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected individual information from a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately
        removed from any access. Because we do not collect such information, we have no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. We have designed this policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").</p>

        <h3>2. How Do We Use Individual Information?</h3>
        <p>We use individual information mainly to provide and improve the Services, to perform our contractual obligations in our Terms of Use, and we may also contact users regarding account activities, new version and product offerings, or other
        communications relevant to the Services. We do not sell or share any Personally Identifiable Information or other information about our users to any third parties except as specified in this Privacy Policy. </p>

        <p>If you contact us by email or by filling-out a registration form, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you.</p>

        <p>In addition, we may use the individual information described above to send you promotional communications regarding the Services. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such promotional communications from us, email us at <a href="mailto:support@buysellads.com">support@buysellads.com</a> and request to be removed from our list. </p>

        <h3>3. How Do We Store Your Personal Information?</h3>
        <h4>Storage and Security of Individual Information</h4>
        <p>The Company operates or leases secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals
        have access to the information. Notwithstanding such measures, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent our computers from being illegally accessed, and the individual information on them stolen or altered.</p>

        <p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and individual information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or
        device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>

        <h4>Third Party Hosting, Serving and Storage</h4>
        <p>We may contract with Third Party Service Providers from time to time, to provide for our hosting, authentication, serving, storage and telecommunication needs, etc., including without limitation storage of our users’ Personally Identifiable
        Information. We carefully choose such Third Party Service Providers with respect to their privacy and security practices, and unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, these Third Party Service Providers do not have any right to use the
        Personally Identifiable Information we provide to them beyond what is necessary for them to assist us.</p>

        <h4>Retention of Information </h4>
        <p>How long we keep your Personally Identifiable Information depends on the reasons we collected it and how we use it (as described in parts (1) and (2) above), and we do need certain information in order to provide some of the Services to you. If
        you decide to delete your information, we may cancel your account. We may retain an archived copy of certain records as we believe is necessary for our legal, accounting, and reasonable business purposes or is required by law.</p>

        <h3>4. Do We Disseminate Any Personal Information?</h3>
        <h4>Publishers and Advertisers</h4>
        <p>As part of the buying and selling process and related transactions in our marketplace Services, we facilitate the sharing of information, which may include some Personally Identifiable Information, between our publisher and advertiser users who
        work directly with each other. By using the Services for such transactions, you are directing us to share such information in this way. We expect you to respect the rights of the users whose information you receive and you may not use such
        information without the express consent of that user except as needed in connection with these transactions.</p>

        <h4>Service Providers</h4>
        <p>We may use third parties to help operate and distribute our Services, authenticate users and deliver products and services, and may share limited Personally Identifiable Information with our service providers, vendors, suppliers, and other third
        parties that provide products or services for or through this Service (such as website or database hosting companies, authentication providers, credit card payment processors, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, analytics
        companies, distribution companies and other similar service providers that use such information on our behalf) ( “Third Party Service Providers”). Unless otherwise stated, these Third Party Service Providers do not have any right to use the
        Personally Identifiable Information we provide to them beyond what is necessary for them to assist us.</p>

        <h4>Aggregate Statistics</h4>
        <p>We may disclose aggregate statistics regarding user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Services to third parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify
        any individual user or client. For example, aggregated data may be accessed by publishers running our serving technology and the advertisers they work with directly, and our advertisers may access aggregate geographic data for their campaigns.</p>

        <h4>Complying with Legal Process</h4>
        <p>We take reasonable steps to ensure the privacy of data uploaded. We reserve the right to use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information and other information in response to subpoenas, court orders, warrants, or legal process, or to
