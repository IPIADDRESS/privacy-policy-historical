We will also obtain Personal Information from Excentus when you are enrolled in FRN™ Dining by Excentus in connection with the Fuel Rewards Network™ program. This may include information such as your name, email and mailing address, other addresses (e.g. work, school), telephone number(s), payment card number(s) and expiration dates, loyalty program account numbers, username and password, the answer to a security question (in case you forget your password), special dates (e.g. birthday, anniversary), and dining preferences.

The merchants that participate in the rewards program we operate include merchants at which you may earn a benefit from FRN™ Dining and also merchants who are not available to you for earning a benefit but participate in other rewards programs that we operate. Benefits may not be available because (1) benefits are not offered on that day of the week or time of day, (2) benefits are not offered to members of FRN™ Dining, (3) benefits are not offered to you based on your member status or participation level in FRN™ Dining or (4) you otherwise do not qualify to receive a benefit at that merchant. This means that we may receive information about transactions that you make at merchants even though you are not aware that the merchant participates in a rewards program that we operate and even though you do not receive a benefit with respect to that transaction. The information that we receive regarding registered payment card transactions at merchants who participate in the rewards programs that we operate include the merchant you visited, the date of your visit, the amount of your bill and the payment card used to pay.
