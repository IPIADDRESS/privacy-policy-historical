	<p>
We are committed to protecting our users' privacy<br>
<br> We at Fuckbook offer this Privacy Policy ("Policy") to
inform Users of the Fuckbook ("Website") how we define,
collect, use and disclose the personal information you provide to us.
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to alter this Policy at
any time. Alterations shall become effective immediately once posted on
the Website. We will notify you of a substantive change to this Policy
by posting a notice of such substantial change on the home page of the
Website and we may also email you to notify you of such changes. Your
continued use of the Website following the posting of changes and/or
modifications will constitute your acceptance of the revised privacy
policy.<br> By providing personal information to us, and by using
the Website or Service, you consent to our collection, use and
disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Policy.<br>
Please read this Policy carefully and save it. If you do not agree with
the terms of this Policy, you should leave the Website and discontinue
use of the Service immediately. In addition, if you are an individual
who wishes to become a Registered User or Member, you must read this
Policy and indicate your acceptance of its terms by following the
instructions on the "[REGISTRATION]" page and check the box
labelled "I have read and agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms
and Conditions. I confirm I have reached the age of majority in my
jurisdiction." <br> For the purposes of this Policy,
"personal information" shall mean any information that can
identify an individual directly or through other reasonable means. </p>

<h3>1) Information We Gather Automatically. </h3>
<p>
	Each time a visitor visits the Website, our servers collect certain
	non-personal technical information, including, but not necessarily
	limited to, the visitor's IP Address, referral data and
	browser/platform type. This information is recorded by the standard
	operation of Fuckbook's Internet servers. We also count, track and
	aggregate a visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic
	flows at the Website (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how
	traffic flows within the Website, etc.). The information collected here
	cannot identify who you are as an individual. However, we may use your
	IP addresses in cooperation with your Internet provider to identify you
	if we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use
	or to protect our service, the Website, users or others.<br> We may
	merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may
	then at our discretion be shared on an aggregated basis with our
	advertisers. We will not disclose your individual identity or
	personally identifiable data without your permission. <br> What are
	IP Addresses? An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned
	to your computer by your Internet provider whenever you're surfing the
	Internet. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable
	information, which means that your session will be logged anonymously.
	<br> What are Cookies? We use cookies to store visitors' preferences
	and to record session information, for purposes including ensuring that
	visitors are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements, and to
	customize advertising and web page content for individual users. A
	cookie is an alphanumeric identifier which we transfer to your hard
	drive through your web browser when you visit our Website. It enables
	our own system to recognise you when you visit our Website again and
	improve our service to you. Cookies may also be used to compile
	aggregate information about areas of our Website that are visited most
	frequently. <br> This traffic information can be used to enhance the
	content of our Website and make your use of it easier. We do not link
	the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable
	information you submit while on the Website. Note that you must enable
	cookies from Fuckbook.com in order to use most functions on the
	Website. Nevertheless, if you wish to reject our cookies, you can
	configure your browser to do so (instructions for disabling cookies can
	be found in <a href="http://www.fuckbook.com/about/faq">our FAQs</a>. Please note that
	Fuckbook allows third parties who are presenting advertisements on some
	of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer in a
	process that Fuckbook does not control. Advertisers' uses of cookies
	are subject to their own privacy policies, not this Policy. Therefore,
	we suggest that you examine the privacy policies of such advertisers to
	learn how they may collect, use, share and disclose your personal
	information. </p>

<h3>2) Information Required for Registration. </h3>
<p>
	Fuckbook will identify to you the purposes for which it will collect or
	use personal information before or at the time the information is
	collected. The type of personal information we may request depends on
	and is related to the reason (or purpose) such personal information was
	provided to us. During the process to become a User of the Website, we
	ask for general identifying information to provide you with customized
	service. We gather personal contact information such as screen name,
	email address, and some demographic information such as age, gender and
	general geographic location. Any other information you choose to enter,
	such as your personal interests and preferences and general indications
	of the type of partner you are looking for using the Service, is
	completely optional. <br> We encourage Users to fill out their
	profiles as completely as possible, with the understanding that, once
	entered, contact information is treated anonymously and is not
	available to other Fuckbook Users. Any communications from other Users
	are done via our internal systems, which are used to match the message
	to you and generate an e-mail notification without disclosing any
	information aside from your chosen screen name.<br> The choice to
	provide us with your personal information is always yours. However,
	your decision to withhold particular information may result in limiting
	our ability to respond to your inquiries or provide you with the
	Services you requested. If a new purpose is identified for the use of
	the information collected, the new purpose will be explained prior to
	its new use. Unless the new purpose is required by law, your consent is
	required before information can be used for that purpose. Demographic
	information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with third
	parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with
	specific individuals at any time.<br> Note that, during the
	Membership process, third party billing agents will collect personally
	identifiable information required to process payments for the service.
	Fuckbook retains information (name and address) to correctly identify
	you in dealings with third party billing agents. Additional information
	gathered by third party billing agents is not controlled by Fuckbook or
	this Policy. </p>

<h3>3) Voluntary Inclusion of Personal Information. </h3>
<p> Personally identifiable information that you
	enter into your profile, that you include in communications with other
	Members or Users, or that you disclose in any media (text, chat
	streams, graphical, audio, visual or audio-visual), or that you post or
	display on the Website is accessible by other Users (Registered Users
	and Members) of the Website. Fuckbook is not responsible for any
	privacy issues arising from your own voluntary posting or transmission
	of personal information via the Service. You acknowledge and agree that
	you (not Fuckbook or our affiliates, advertisers, employees and content
	providers) shall be solely responsible and liable for all damages,
	liability or other consequences, foreseen or unforeseen, of all
	information which you submit, publish, display, disseminate or
	otherwise communicate through the Website even if a claim for damages
	or liability should arise after termination of service. </p>

<h3>4) Communication. </h3>
<p> The Website directly
	communicates with Members and Users through email, instant messaging,
	and in some cases, downloaded executables. This enables Members to
	receive information when they are not on the Website, so they remain
	current on internal communication and updates from other Users or from
	us directly. The Website may also use personally identifiable
	information within your profile to send information to you that, in
	some cases, are targeted to your interests, such as special banners and
	promotions. Should you not wish Fuckbook to send you information on
	other services or products, please just contact us using the
	information provided in section 17 below. <br> Members of the
	Website can directly communicate with you through messaging services
	that are part of the Service (mail, chat or via comments). We may use
	personally identifiable information within your profile to send
	notifications of these communications to you, but your personally
	identifiable information is not disclosed to other Members by us. </p>

<h3>5) Referrals. </h3>
<p>If you choose to use our
	external referral service to tell a friend about the Website, we will
	ask you for your friend's contact information. The Website will
	automatically send your friend an e-mail inviting them to visit the
	Website. The Website maintains this information for the sole purpose of
	sending this email and tracking the success of the referral. </p>

<h3>6) Your Use of Other Users' Information. </h3>
<p>
	You may not use other Users' information for commercial purposes, to
	send SPAM or SPIM, to harass, to make unlawful threats, or for any
	other illegal purpose. Fuckbook reserves the right to terminate the
	Service to those who misuse other Users' information.<br> If you
	receive communications that you find to have violated this Policy,
	please contact us using the information provided in section 17 below,
	being sure to include the message text and the User who sent the
	communication to you. </p>

<h3>7) Accuracy of Personal Information, Information Review and Removal. </h3>
<p> We shall make every reasonable
	effort to ensure your personal information is accurate, complete and
	up-to-date. You are responsible for advising Fuckbook of any
	inaccuracies or changes to your personal information. <br> Users may
	modify or remove any of their information associated with their profile
	at any time by logging into their account and accessing the Edit
	Profile feature.<br> Users may, at any time, delete their profiles
	or remove any images or audio-visual material that they have posted to
	the Website. </p>

<h3>8) Promotion. </h3>
<p> From time to time,
	Fuckbook may sponsor sweepstakes, contests or other events of interest
	to our users. Fuckbook may co-sponsor these events with third party
	organizations, and may be required to share demographic information to
	be used for the event. Any shared demographic information will not be
	associated with individual users; it will only be presented as
	aggregated information. <br> In some cases, promotions or
	sweepstakes that may be of interest to our users may require us to
	share email information with third party sponsors or partners. A User's
	personal email information will not be released to any third party
	organization without the User's express consent and disclosure of the
	sponsor organization's name, and Fuckbook will request that such named
	sponsors uphold the privacy of the registrant's information by not
	distributing or sharing such information with any other businesses or
	organizations, and we will ensure that such sponsors agree to be bound
	by the terms of this Policy. <br> Should you not wish to receive
	notices or be considered for sweepstakes, contests or other events,
	please contact us using the information provided in section 17 below. </p>

<h3>9) Disclosure and Retention of Personal Information. </h3>
<p> We will only use or disclose your personal
	information in accordance with the purposes for which it was originally
	collected unless you have otherwise consented, or when required or
	permitted by law. We will keep your personal information only for so
	long as is required to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected
	or as required by law. Except as explained in this Policy, or as
	otherwise consented to by you, we do not disclose any personal
	information to third parties. The following are the limited instances
	where we may disclose your personal information to third parties: </p>
<ol>
	<li>When this information must be shared to provide a product or
		service you have requested.
	</li>
	<li>We need to send the information to companies who work on our
		behalf to provide a product or service to you.
	</li>
	<li>To investigate and/or enforce violations of our Terms and
		Conditions and/or this Policy, or to protect our interests in our
		operation and our legal rights and protections.
	</li>
	<li>To investigate potentially fraudulent or questionable
		activities.
	</li>
	<li>When required or permitted by law. Fuckbook (including our
		affiliates, advertisers and content providers) independently reserves
		the right to fully cooperate with requests from any recognized law
		enforcement authority, and to court orders, requesting or directing
		Fuckbook (including our affiliates, advertisers and content
		providers) to disclose the identity or other information regarding
		any person who is using or has used the Website or the Service or has
		obtained any Content available through or in association with the
		Website. By accepting this Policy and using the Website and/or the
		Service, you waive and hold harmless Fuckbook, our affiliates,
		content providers, and the operators of the Website from any and all
		claims resulting from any and all actions taken by any of the
		foregoing during, or as a result of any law enforcement authority's
		investigations or inquiries.
	</li>
	<li>In the course of a sale or potential sale, reorganization,
		consolidation, merger or amalgamation of our business. In order to
		ensure a smooth transition of the Service in the event of a merger,
		acquisition, reorganization, sale of all or substantially all of its
		assets or the sale of an individual website owned by Fuckbook,
		Fuckbook may transfer your personally identifiable information to a
		third party as a part of such merger, acquisition, reorganization or
		sale. In the event the transaction proceeds, we will require that the
		receiving party agree that they will be similarly bound by the
		provisions of this privacy policy and that they will only use and
		disclose your personal information as we are similarly entitled under
		this privacy policy. In the event the sale does not proceed, we will
		require the potential purchaser to not use or disclose your personal
		information in any manner whatsoever and to completely erase the
		same.
	</li>
	<li>Where such disclosure is described elsewhere in this
		Policy.This Policy does not protect information you post to any
		online profile, bulletin board, e-note, video chat room, or any other
		forum accessible to other Users or other sites within Fuckbook.
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>10) Location of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We are an
	international organization with servers located in various
	jurisdictions. As a result, User and Member personal information may be
	transferred to and stored in Canada, Ireland or elsewhere. We do the
	best we can to ensure your personal information is protected to the
	greatest extent possible. However, please note that the jurisdiction in
	which we store your personal information may not have similar standards
	for protecting your personal information as are provided for in your
	country. As well, government organizations from the jurisdiction in
	which the personal information is stored may have access to your
	personal information in accordance with the laws of such jurisdiction. </p>

<h3>11) Employee Access to Your Personal Information. </h3>
<p> In the course of daily operations, access to
	private, sensitive and confidential information is restricted to
	authorized employees who have a legitimate business purpose and reason
	for accessing it. As a condition of their employment, all employees of
	Fuckbook are required to follow this Policy. Employees are informed
	about the importance of privacy and they are required to agree to a
	code of conduct that prohibits the disclosure of any personal
	information to unauthorized individuals or parties. <br>
	Unauthorized access to and/or disclosure of personal information by an
	employee of Fuckbook is strictly prohibited. All employees are expected
	to maintain the confidentiality of personal information at all times
	and failing to do so will result in appropriate disciplinary measures,
	which may include dismissal. </p>

<h3>12) Our Commitment to Data Security.</h3>
<p>
	The security of your personal information is a priority to Fuckbook. We
	are responsible for protecting personal information under our control,
	including personal information that has been transferred to, or
	received from, a third party.<br> Registered User and Member
	accounts are secured by member-created passwords. We use reasonable
	measures to protect registration and membership information that is
	stored within our database, and we restrict access to User information
	to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such
	as our customer service personnel and technical staff, and such
	employees shall be required to respect the privacy of that information.
	<br> In the event that personal information is transferred to a
	third party, Fuckbook will take steps to ensure that such recipients
	safeguard the personal information and use the information only for
	authorized purposes. Some examples of such measures are as follows: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Physical security measures such as restricted access
		facilities and locked filing cabinets.
	</li>
	<li>Electronic security measures for computerized personal
		information such as password protection, database encryption and
		personal identification numbers.
	</li>
	<li>Organizational processes such as limiting access to such
		personal information to a selected group of individuals.
	</li>
	<li>Contractual obligations with third parties who need access to
		personal information by agreements stipulating the confidentiality of
		the information and requiring them to protect and secure the personal
		information.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Please note that we cannot guarantee the security
	of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or
	software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of
	member information at any time. </p>

<h3>13) Our Commitment to Children's Privacy.</h3>
<p>
	Protecting the privacy of the very young is important to us. For that
	reason, we do not collect or maintain information from those we
	actually know are under 18 years of age, and no part of Fuckbook is
	structured to attract anyone under 18 years of age. If you are younger
	than 18 years of age, you are not permitted to use this site. </p>

<h3>14) Websites Governed by this Privacy Policy.</h3>
<p>
	The Website that is governed by the provisions and practices stated in
	this Policy is: Fuckbook. Fuckbook's Website may contain links to other
	third party sites that are not governed by this Policy. Although we
	endeavor to only link to sites with high privacy standards, our Policy
	will no longer apply once you leave Fuckbook's Website. Additionally,
	we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other
	third party websites, nor are we responsible for the content of any
	such web property, company or organization that we do not control.
	Further, we cannot control and are not responsible for the actions of
	the employees, agents or assigns of any such web property, company or
	organization. Therefore, we suggest that you examine the privacy
	policies of those sites to learn how your information may be collected,
	used, shared and disclosed. </p>

<h3>15) Terms and Conditions, Notices and Revisions.</h3>
<p> Your use of the Website, and any disputes arising
	from it, is subject to this Policy as well as our Terms and Conditions
	and all of its dispute resolution provisions including, but not limited
	to, limitations of liability and governing law. </p>

<h3>16) Updating this Privacy Policy. </h3>
<p> This
	Policy is subject to change by Fuckbook at any time. We may modify any
	of the terms contained in this Policy at any time in our sole
	discretion. Any changes to our privacy policy and information handling
	practices will be acknowledged in this policy in a timely manner. We
	may add, modify or remove portions of this policy when we feel it is
	appropriate to do so. You may determine when this policy was last
	updated by referring to the date at the bottom of this privacy policy.
	<br> If any modification to this Policy is unacceptable to you, you
	agree that your only recourse is to terminate this Policy. Your
	continued use of the Service following our posting of a change notice
	or new agreement on the Website will constitute your binding acceptance
	of the change. <br> BY PROVIDING PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US YOU
	SIGNIFY YOUR CONSENT TO OUR COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR
	PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS POLICY. </p>

<h3>17) Handling Complaints, Questions and Suggestions. </h3>
<p> To stop or resume receiving email notifications
	regarding various site activity or offers, users can edit their

	policies and use of personal information, please contact us using our

<h3>18) Dispute Resolution </h3>

	cause of action you may have arising from, connected with, or relating
	to this privacy policy or Fuckbook's handling of your personal
	information, or any related matters must be commenced within six (6)
	months after the claim or cause of action arises, after which time the
	claim or cause of action is forever barred, regardless of any statute
	or law to the contrary. </p>
