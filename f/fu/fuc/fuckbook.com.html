We reserve the right, at our  sole discretion, to alter this Policy at any time. Alterations shall  become effective immediately once posted on the Website. We will notify  you of a substantive change to this Policy by posting a notice of such  substantial change on the home page of the Website and we may also  email you to notify you of such changes. Your continued use of the  Website following the posting of changes and/or modifications will  constitute your acceptance of the revised privacy policy.<br>             By  providing personal information to us, and by using the Website or  Service, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your  personal information in accordance with this Policy.<br>             Please read  this Policy carefully and save it. If you do not agree with the terms  of this Policy, you should leave the Website and discontinue use of the  Service immediately. In addition, if you are an individual who wishes  to become a Registered User or Member, you must read this Policy and  indicate your acceptance of its terms by following the instructions on  the "[REGISTRATION]" page and check the box labelled "I have read and  agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. I confirm I have  reached the age of majority in my jurisdiction." <br>             For the purposes  of this Policy, "personal information" shall mean any information that  can identify an individual directly or through other reasonable means.</p>           <p align="justify"><br>               <strong>1) Information We Gather  Automatically. </strong><br>             Each time a visitor visits the Website, our servers collect certain  non-personal technical information, including, but not necessarily  limited to, the visitor's IP Address, referral data and  browser/platform type. This information is recorded by the standard  operation of Fuckbook's Internet servers. We also count, track and  aggregate a visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic  flows at the Website (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how  traffic flows within the Website, etc.). The information collected here  cannot identify who you are as an individual. However, we may use your  IP addresses in cooperation with your Internet provider to identify you  if we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use  or to protect our service, the Website, users or others.<br>             We may  merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may  then at our discretion be shared on an aggregated basis with our  advertisers. We will not disclose your individual identity or  personally identifiable data without your permission. <br>             What are IP  Addresses? An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to  your computer by your Internet provider whenever you're surfing the  Internet. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable  information, which means that your session will be logged anonymously. <br>             What are Cookies? We use cookies to store visitors' preferences and to  record session information, for purposes including ensuring that  visitors are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements, and to  customize advertising and web page content for individual users. A  cookie is an alphanumeric identifier which we transfer to your hard  drive through your web browser when you visit our Website. It enables  our own system to recognise you when you visit our Website again and  improve our service to you. Cookies may also be used to compile  aggregate information about areas of our Website that are visited most  frequently. <br>             This traffic information can be used to enhance the  content of our Website and make your use of it easier. We do not link  the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable  information you submit while on the Website. Note that you must enable  cookies from Fuckbook.com in order to use most functions on the  Website. Nevertheless, if you wish to reject our cookies, you can  configure your browser to do so (instructions for disabling cookies can  be found in our FAQs <a href="/faq.php">here</a>.  Please note that Fuckbook allows third parties who are presenting  advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on  your computer in a process that Fuckbook does not control. Advertisers'  uses of cookies are subject to their own privacy policies, not this  Policy. Therefore, we suggest that you examine the privacy policies of  such advertisers to learn how they may collect, use, share and disclose  your personal information. </p>           <p align="justify"><br>               <strong>2) Information Required for  Registration. </strong><br>             Fuckbook will identify to you the purposes for which it will collect or  use personal information before or at the time the information is  collected. The type of personal information we may request depends on  and is related to the reason (or purpose) such personal information was  provided to us. During the process to become a User of the Website, we  ask for general identifying information to provide you with customized  service. We gather personal contact information such as screen name,  email address, and some demographic information such as age, gender and  general geographic location. Any other information you choose to enter,  such as your personal interests and preferences and general indications  of the type of partner you are looking for using the Service, is  completely optional. <br>             We encourage Users to fill out their  profiles as completely as possible, with the understanding that, once  entered, contact information is treated anonymously and is not  available to other Fuckbook Users. Any communications from other Users  are done via our internal systems, which are used to match the message  to you and generate an e-mail notification without disclosing any  information aside from your chosen screen name.<br>             The choice to  provide us with your personal information is always yours. However,  your decision to withhold particular information may result in limiting  our ability to respond to your inquiries or provide you with the  Services you requested. If a new purpose is identified for the use of  the information collected, the new purpose will be explained prior to  its new use. Unless the new purpose is required by law, your consent is  required before information can be used for that purpose. Demographic  information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with third  parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with  specific individuals at any time.<br>             Note that, during the Membership  process, third party billing agents will collect personally  identifiable information required to process payments for the service.  Fuckbook retains information (name and address) to correctly identify  you in dealings with third party billing agents. Additional information  gathered by third party billing agents is not controlled by Fuckbook or  this Policy. </p>           <p align="justify"><br>               <strong>3) Voluntary Inclusion of  Personal Information. </strong><br>             Personally identifiable information that you enter into your profile,  that you include in communications with other Members or Users, or that  you disclose in any media (text, chat streams, graphical, audio, visual  or audio-visual), or that you post or display on the Website is  accessible by other Users (Registered Users and Members) of the  Website. Fuckbook is not responsible for any privacy issues arising  from your own voluntary posting or transmission of personal information  via the Service. You acknowledge and agree that you (not Fuckbook or  our affiliates, advertisers, employees and content providers) shall be  solely responsible and liable for all damages, liability or other  consequences, foreseen or unforeseen, of all information which you  submit, publish, display, disseminate or otherwise communicate through  the Website even if a claim for damages or liability should arise after  termination of service.</p>           <p align="justify"><br>               <strong>4) Communication. </strong><br>             The Website directly communicates with Members and Users through email,  instant messaging, and in some cases, downloaded executables. This  enables Members to receive information when they are not on the  Website, so they remain current on internal communication and updates  from other Users or from us directly. The Website may also use  personally identifiable information within your profile to send  information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your interests,  such as special banners and promotions. Should you not wish Fuckbook to  send you information on other services or products, please just contact  us using the information provided in section 17 below. <br>             Members of  the Website can directly communicate with you through messaging  services that are part of the Service (mail, chat or via comments).

A User's personal email information will not be released to  any third party organization without the User's express consent and  disclosure of the sponsor organization's name, and Fuckbook will  request that such named sponsors uphold the privacy of the registrant's  information by not distributing or sharing such information with any  other businesses or organizations, and we will ensure that such  sponsors agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. <br>             Should  you not wish to receive notices or be considered for sweepstakes,  contests or other events, please contact us using the information  provided in section 17 below. </p>           <p align="justify"><br>               <strong>9) Disclosure and Retention  of Personal Information. </strong><br>             We will only use or disclose your personal information in accordance  with the purposes for which it was originally collected unless you have  otherwise consented, or when required or permitted by law.

Except as  explained in this Policy, or as otherwise consented to by you, we do  not disclose any personal information to third parties. The following  are the limited instances where we may disclose your personal  information to third parties:</p>                        <div align="justify">               <ol start="1" type="1">                 <li>When this information must be shared to       provide a product or service you have requested.</li>                 <li>We need to send the information to companies       who work on our behalf to provide a product or service to you.</li>                 <li>To  investigate and/or enforce violations of our Terms and Conditions  and/or this Policy, or to protect our interests in our operation and  our legal rights and protections.</li>                 <li>To investigate potentially fraudulent or       questionable activities.</li>                 <li>When  required or permitted by law.

Some examples of such measures are as follows:</p>                        <div align="justify">               <ol start="1" type="1">                 <li>Physical security measures such as restricted       access facilities and locked filing cabinets. </li>                 <li>Electronic  security measures for computerized personal information such as  password protection, database encryption and personal identification  numbers.</li>                 <li>Organizational processes such as limiting       access to such personal information to a selected group of individuals.</li>                 <li>Contractual  obligations with third parties who need access to personal information  by agreements stipulating the confidentiality of the information and  requiring them to protect and secure the personal information.</li>               </ol>             </div>             <p align="justify">Please  note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account  information.
