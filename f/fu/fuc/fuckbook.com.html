		<h3>1) Information We Gather Automatically. </h3>
		<p>
			Each time a visitor visits the Website, our servers collect certain
			non-personal technical information, including, but not necessarily
			limited to, the visitor's IP Address, referral data and
			browser/platform type. This information is recorded by the standard
			operation of Fuckbook's Internet servers. We also count, track and
			aggregate a visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic
			flows at the Website (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how
			traffic flows within the Website, etc.). The information collected here
			cannot identify who you are as an individual. However, we may use your
			IP addresses in cooperation with your Internet provider to identify you
			if we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use
			or to protect our service, the Website, users or others.<br> We may
			merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may
			then at our discretion be shared on an aggregated basis with our
			advertisers. We will not disclose your individual identity or
			personally identifiable data without your permission. <br> What are
			IP Addresses? An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned
			to your computer by your Internet provider whenever you're surfing the
			Internet. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable
			information, which means that your session will be logged anonymously.
			<br> What are Cookies? We use cookies to store visitors' preferences
			and to record session information, for purposes including ensuring that
			visitors are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements, and to
			customize advertising and web page content for individual users. A
			cookie is an alphanumeric identifier which we transfer to your hard
			drive through your web browser when you visit our Website. It enables
			our own system to recognise you when you visit our Website again and
			improve our service to you. Cookies may also be used to compile
			aggregate information about areas of our Website that are visited most
			frequently. <br> This traffic information can be used to enhance the
			content of our Website and make your use of it easier. We do not link
			the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable
			information you submit while on the Website. Note that you must enable
			cookies from Fuckbook.com in order to use most functions on the
			Website. Nevertheless, if you wish to reject our cookies, you can
			configure your browser to do so (instructions for disabling cookies can
			be found in <a href="/about/faq">our FAQs</a>. Please note that
			Fuckbook allows third parties who are presenting advertisements on some
			of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer in a
			process that Fuckbook does not control. Advertisers' uses of cookies
			are subject to their own privacy policies, not this Policy. Therefore,
			we suggest that you examine the privacy policies of such advertisers to
			learn how they may collect, use, share and disclose your personal
			information.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
		<h3>2) Information Required for Registration. </h3>
		<p>
			Fuckbook will identify to you the purposes for which it will collect or
			use personal information before or at the time the information is
			collected. The type of personal information we may request depends on
			and is related to the reason (or purpose) such personal information was
			provided to us. During the process to become a User of the Website, we
			ask for general identifying information to provide you with customized
			service. We gather personal contact information such as screen name,
			email address, and some demographic information such as age, gender and
			general geographic location. Any other information you choose to enter,
			such as your personal interests and preferences and general indications
			of the type of partner you are looking for using the Service, is
			completely optional. <br> We encourage Users to fill out their
			profiles as completely as possible, with the understanding that, once
			entered, contact information is treated anonymously and is not
			available to other Fuckbook Users. Any communications from other Users
			are done via our internal systems, which are used to match the message
			to you and generate an e-mail notification without disclosing any
			information aside from your chosen screen name.<br> The choice to
			provide us with your personal information is always yours. However,
			your decision to withhold particular information may result in limiting
			our ability to respond to your inquiries or provide you with the
			Services you requested. If a new purpose is identified for the use of
			the information collected, the new purpose will be explained prior to
			its new use. Unless the new purpose is required by law, your consent is
			required before information can be used for that purpose. Demographic
			information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with third
			parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with
			specific individuals at any time.<br> Note that, during the
			Membership process, third party billing agents will collect personally
			identifiable information required to process payments for the service.
			Fuckbook retains information (name and address) to correctly identify
			you in dealings with third party billing agents. Additional information
			gathered by third party billing agents is not controlled by Fuckbook or
			this Policy.

	<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
		<h3>3) Voluntary Inclusion of Personal Information. </h3>
		<p> Personally identifiable information that you
			enter into your profile, that you include in communications with other
			Members or Users, or that you disclose in any media (text, chat
			streams, graphical, audio, visual or audio-visual), or that you post or
			display on the Website is accessible by other Users (Registered Users
			and Members) of the Website. Fuckbook is not responsible for any
			privacy issues arising from your own voluntary posting or transmission
			of personal information via the Service. You acknowledge and agree that
			you (not Fuckbook or our affiliates, advertisers, employees and content
			providers) shall be solely responsible and liable for all damages,
			liability or other consequences, foreseen or unforeseen, of all
			information which you submit, publish, display, disseminate or
			otherwise communicate through the Website even if a claim for damages
			or liability should arise after termination of service.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
		<h3>4) Communication. </h3>
		<p> The Website directly
			communicates with Members and Users through email, instant messaging,
			and in some cases, downloaded executables. This enables Members to
			receive information when they are not on the Website, so they remain
			current on internal communication and updates from other Users or from
			us directly. The Website may also use personally identifiable
			information within your profile to send information to you that, in
			some cases, are targeted to your interests, such as special banners and
			promotions. Should you not wish Fuckbook to send you information on
			other services or products, please just contact us using the
			information provided in section 17 below. <br> Members of the
			Website can directly communicate with you through messaging services
			that are part of the Service (mail, chat or via comments). We may use
			personally identifiable information within your profile to send
			notifications of these communications to you, but your personally
			identifiable information is not disclosed to other Members by us.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
		<h3>5) Referrals. </h3>
		<p>If you choose to use our
			external referral service to tell a friend about the Website, we will
			ask you for your friend's contact information. The Website will
			automatically send your friend an e-mail inviting them to visit the
			Website. The Website maintains this information for the sole purpose of
			sending this email and tracking the success of the referral.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
		<h3>6) Your Use of Other Users' Information. </h3>
		<p>
			You may not use other Users' information for commercial purposes, to
			send SPAM or SPIM, to harass, to make unlawful threats, or for any
			other illegal purpose. Fuckbook reserves the right to terminate the
			Service to those who misuse other Users' information.<br> If you
			receive communications that you find to have violated this Policy,
			please contact us using the information provided in section 17 below,
			being sure to include the message text and the User who sent the
			communication to you.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
		<h3>7) Accuracy of Personal Information, Information Review and Removal. </h3>
		<p> We shall make every reasonable
			effort to ensure your personal information is accurate, complete and
			up-to-date. You are responsible for advising Fuckbook of any
			inaccuracies or changes to your personal information. <br> Users may
			modify or remove any of their information associated with their profile
			at any time by logging into their account and accessing the Edit
			Profile feature.<br> Users may, at any time, delete their profiles
			or remove any images or audio-visual material that they have posted to
			the Website.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
		<h3>8) Promotion. </h3>
		<p> From time to time,
			Fuckbook may sponsor sweepstakes, contests or other events of interest
			to our users. Fuckbook may co-sponsor these events with third party
			organizations, and may be required to share demographic information to
			be used for the event. Any shared demographic information will not be
			associated with individual users; it will only be presented as
			aggregated information. <br> In some cases, promotions or
			sweepstakes that may be of interest to our users may require us to
			share email information with third party sponsors or partners. A User's
			personal email information will not be released to any third party
			organization without the User's express consent and disclosure of the
			sponsor organization's name, and Fuckbook will request that such named
			sponsors uphold the privacy of the registrant's information by not
			distributing or sharing such information with any other businesses or
			organizations, and we will ensure that such sponsors agree to be bound
			by the terms of this Policy. <br> Should you not wish to receive
			notices or be considered for sweepstakes, contests or other events,
			please contact us using the information provided in section 17 below.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
		<h3>9) Disclosure and Retention of Personal Information. </h3>
		<p> We will only use or disclose your personal
			information in accordance with the purposes for which it was originally
			collected unless you have otherwise consented, or when required or
			permitted by law. We will keep your personal information only for so
			long as is required to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected
			or as required by law. Except as explained in this Policy, or as
			otherwise consented to by you, we do not disclose any personal
			information to third parties. The following are the limited instances
			where we may disclose your personal information to third parties:

				Fuckbook may transfer your personally identifiable information to a
				third party as a part of such merger, acquisition, reorganization or

				receiving party agree that they will be similarly bound by the
				provisions of this privacy policy and that they will only use and
				disclose your personal information as we are similarly entitled under
				this privacy policy. In the event the sale does not proceed, we will

		<h3>10) Location of Personal Information</h3>
		<p>We are an
			international organization with servers located in various
			jurisdictions. As a result, User and Member personal information may be
			transferred to and stored in Canada, Ireland or elsewhere. We do the
			best we can to ensure your personal information is protected to the
			greatest extent possible. However, please note that the jurisdiction in
			which we store your personal information may not have similar standards
			for protecting your personal information as are provided for in your
			country. As well, government organizations from the jurisdiction in
			which the personal information is stored may have access to your
			personal information in accordance with the laws of such jurisdiction.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
		<h3>11) Employee Access to Your Personal Information. </h3>
		<p> In the course of daily operations, access to
			private, sensitive and confidential information is restricted to
			authorized employees who have a legitimate business purpose and reason
			for accessing it. As a condition of their employment, all employees of
			Fuckbook are required to follow this Policy. Employees are informed

			code of conduct that prohibits the disclosure of any personal
			information to unauthorized individuals or parties. <br>
			Unauthorized access to and/or disclosure of personal information by an

		<h3>12) Our Commitment to Data Security.</h3>
		<p>
			The security of your personal information is a priority to Fuckbook. We
			are responsible for protecting personal information under our control,
			including personal information that has been transferred to, or
			received from, a third party.<br> Registered User and Member
			accounts are secured by member-created passwords. We use reasonable
			measures to protect registration and membership information that is
			stored within our database, and we restrict access to User information
			to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such
			as our customer service personnel and technical staff, and such
			employees shall be required to respect the privacy of that information.
			<br> In the event that personal information is transferred to a
			third party, Fuckbook will take steps to ensure that such recipients
			safeguard the personal information and use the information only for
			authorized purposes. Some examples of such measures are as follows:
		</p>
		<ol start="1" type="1">
			<li>Physical security measures such as restricted access
				facilities and locked filing cabinets.
			</li>
			<li>Electronic security measures for computerized personal
				information such as password protection, database encryption and
				personal identification numbers.
			</li>
			<li>Organizational processes such as limiting access to such
				personal information to a selected group of individuals.
			</li>
			<li>Contractual obligations with third parties who need access to
				personal information by agreements stipulating the confidentiality of
				the information and requiring them to protect and secure the personal
				information.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Please note that we cannot guarantee the security
			of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or
			software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of
			member information at any time.
