We refer in detail to the following legal bases:</span></p><h2 class="c20" id="h.44sinio"><span>Your consent (Art. 6 (1) lit. a</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&amp; Art. 9 (2) lit. a GDPR)</span></h2><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">When visiting the Website without registration, you agree to the cookie guidelines in the pop-up.

By registering and creating your profile, you expressly agree to its use for the purposes described in detail in this Privacy Notice by ticking the box before </span><span>submitting</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the registration form. So, if we process your data, it is because you have expressly allowed us to do so when you registered. Your consent is therefore the most important legal basis for the processing of your personal data by us. If you provide us with information about your sexual orientation or preferences, we will process this data exclusively on the basis of your consent.</span></p><h2 class="c20" id="h.2jxsxqh"><span class="c10">Fulfilment of contractual obligations (Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR) &nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c8"><span>At the same time, the processing of personal data takes place also for the provision of the Service and in the context of the performance of our contract with you. In many cases, the processing is not only justified by your consent, but also because it is necessary to fulfil our contract with you: In order to fulfil your claim to the Services described in more detail in our General Terms and Conditions, it may be necessary, for example, to process your personal data</span><span>, f</span><span class="c0">or example, if you wish to pay for your Vip or Premium membership the processing of your payment information is required.</span></p><h2 class="c20" id="h.z337ya"><span class="c10">Protecting vital interests (Art. 6 (1) lit. d GDPR)</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c0">We invoke this legal basis in narrowly defined case constellations (e.g. reported suicide announcements) where the processing is necessary for the protection of the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.</span></p><h2 class="c20" id="h.3j2qqm3"><span class="c10">Safeguarding legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR)</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c1">By registering to use the Service, you consent to the processing of your data in accordance with this Privacy Notice. That is why we process your data in principle, because you have allowed us to do so. However, there are some cases in which we would be entitled to process your data without your consent because it is necessary to protect our legitimate interests (or the interests of third parties). In this respect, the purposes for which we process your data also represent legitimate interests. We pursue legitimate interests, for example, if we check images or texts for content relevant under </span><span>a</span><span class="c1">pplicable criminal law or if we take measures to secure our </span><span>‘</span><span class="c0">virtual domiciliary rights.

If the data are no longer necessary for the fulfilment of such obligations, they shall be deleted regularly and without delay, unless their further processing is necessary for the protection of legitimate interests or for the preservation of evidence within the framework of statutes of limitations. In this sense, in particular the storage of age verification and fake suspicion photos and videos is carried out expressly for the entire duration of the contract, since we hold this data in particular for the ongoing guarantee of the protection of minors and the prevention of fraud attempts.</span></p><p class="c3 c24"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>The data collected under 2.a are stored for </span><span>90</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;days.
