<br>
<strong>Consent to   Processing and Transfers of Information.</strong> The servers that make the Web Site   available and that store the information that is collected are located in the   United States of America (“USA”). This Web Site is intended only for use in the   USA. If you are located outside the USA, please note that the information you   provide will be transferred to the USA which may not provide the same level of   legal data protection as the country from which you access the Web Site. By   using the Web Site and submitting Personal Information to FMLS, you consent to   such transfers and the processing by FMLS of information as described in this   Policy and authorize this practice. <br>
<br>
<strong>What Personal Information is   Collected.</strong> FMLS collects Personal Information when you request information   from FMLS, register for an FMLS store account, purchase merchandise from the FMLS Store Web   Site or provide information to participate in the services and offerings on the   Web Site.

This information may include, but is not limited   to, records information from server logs found on your browser, your IP address   and the type of web browser you are using to access the Web Site. This   automatically collected information provides us with information regarding the   use of the Web Site. We may aggregate, use and share certain non-personally   identifiable information and statistical information for research or marketing   purposes. <br>
<br>
<strong>Our Use and Disclosure of Your Personal   Information.</strong><br>
FMLS will not share, sell or rent your Personal Information   to any third party except as provided below: <br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Business Uses. FMLS uses the Personal Information you provide to   us (i) to verify at login that a user is a registered member, if applicable;   (ii) to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested;   (iii) to send order and shipping confirmations; (iv) contact you regarding your   Web Site membership account and to provide customer service and respond to your   requests and inquiries; and (v) to protect you, and us, against error and fraud   and for archival purposes. Your Personal Information may be transferred as an   asset in connection with a merger or sale involving all or part of FMLS or as   part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change of control.   
  </li>
  <li>Service Providers and Vendors. We may share certain Personal   Information we collect about you with third parties who perform services for us   or with whom we contract for the purposes described in this Policy. For example,   we may use third parties to host our Web Site, operate certain of its features,   print or send mailings, authorize and process your payments, provide customer   service, or assist in fulfilling your orders. These third-party service   providers are given the Personal Information that they need to perform their   designated functions and services for us and we do not authorize them to use or   disclose your Personal Information for any other purpose.   
  </li>
  <li>Required Disclosures. FMLS may provide your Personal Information   to a third party if FMLS is required by law to disclose your Personal   Information. For example, FMLS may be required to disclose your Personal   Information to respond to a subpoena, court order or other legal process. </li>
</ul>
<strong>Choices You Have.</strong> The provision of Personal Information through   this Web Site is voluntary. If you do not wish to provide your Personal   Information, you are free not to do so. Your provision of requested Personal   Information to us through our Web Site or other means is presumed by us to be   voluntary and with your consent to the uses described herein. However, in some   cases, only persons who provide the requested Personal Information will be able   to establish a membership account, order products and services or otherwise   participate in the Web Site activities and offerings. <br>
<br>
<strong>General   Audience Website.</strong> The Web Site is considered a general audience site and is   not intended to be used by children. FMLS is concerned about the privacy of   young children and does not seek to collect Personal Information from persons   under the age of 13. We offer our services and our Web Site for use by adults.   If you are under 13, you may use the Web Site only with the involvement of a   parent or legal guardian. No information should be submitted to or posted at   this Web Site by children 13 years of age or under without their parent's or   guardian's consent. <br>
<br>
<strong>Use of Cookies.</strong> Cookies are pieces of   information that a Web Site transfers to an individual's hard drive for   record-keeping purposes while at the website. FMLS does not share information   transferred through cookies with any third parties. FMLS does not use cookies to   identify individuals or to retrieve information from your computer that was not   originally sent in a cookie. Cookies help make FMLS better by showing us how and   when guests use the Web Site. They do not, however, gather user specific   information about persons who use the We Site. Most browsers are initially set   to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies.   However, it is possible that some areas of the Web Site will not function   properly if you do so. <br>
<br>
<strong>Security.</strong> We employ various reasonable   security measures designed to help protect the Personal Information that we   collect about you. FMLS is capable of using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 128-bit   encryption technology in the transmission of Personal Information to FMLS. We   have instituted industry standard security procedures and measures to protect   our servers and networks that store Personal Information. Unfortunately, no   transmission of information over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%   secure and therefore we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any such   information. <br>
<br>
<strong>Managing Your Information.</strong> FMLS reserves the right   to retain any Personal Information reasonably necessary to appropriately   document its business activities and for archival and record retention purposes.   We will store your Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary for   the purposes described in this Policy. You have the right to request corrections   to your Personal Information we have collected via the Web Site through the   means provided on the Web Site or by sending a request to FMLS as provided   below. <br>
