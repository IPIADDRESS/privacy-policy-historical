    <p><em>This Privacy Policy is effective as of June 15, 2008.</em><br>At  Federated Media Publishing ("FM"), we represent online publishers and  their properties ("Publisher Properties") to advertisers and support  other properties sponsored by advertiser clients ("Client-Sponsored  Properties"). Because we understand the importance of your privacy, we  take safeguarding your personal information very seriously. We are  providing the following Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and  procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of the  personally identifiable information collected from you during your use  of any FM website whether from (i) a Client-Sponsored Property or other  website on federatedmedia.net (the "FM Domain") (such as the Federated  Media home page at (http://federatedmedia.net/)) or (ii) a  Client-Sponsored Property on a different domain (each a "Site" together  our "Sites"). You’ll know you’re on one of our Sites because a version  of this Privacy Policy will be posted.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason.  We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new policy on  each Site and highlighting the changes. We suggest that you consult an  FM Site regularly to check for any changes to this Privacy Policy. If  you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our privacy  practices, please contact us at privacypolicy@federatedmedia.net .<br><br><em>Information We Collect</em><br>We  collect information in connection with our Sites and Services in the  following circumstances, though not every one of our Sites offers each  of these four: (i) registering for an account, (ii) participation in  surveys, sweepstakes, contests, and promotions ("Surveys and  Promotions"), (iii) contacting FM, and (iv) visiting and browsing any of  our Sites.<br><br><em>Registration</em><br>Information collected during  the registration process may include your name, company name, company  address, phone number, username, email address, date of birth, account  password. We may also collect your IP address when you register and use  the Site. Note that you must register on the FM Domain in order to  become an FM advertiser for the Publisher Properties. From time to time  in the future we may offer additional features, services, and  promotional opportunities that may require you to submit additional  information to participate.<br><br><em>Surveys and Promotions</em><br>We  also collect certain information about you and your web browsing  sessions if you participate in Surveys and Promotions, which allows FM  to coordinate the marketing support that allows FM publishers to  continue to share their knowledge, insights, and opinions. Participation  in Surveys and Promotions is optional. Should you choose to  participate, the information we collect for Surveys and Promotions may  include your name, phone number, address, e-mail address, IP address,  website from whence you came to the applicable Site, travel preferences,  favorite websites, family profile, age, whether you are a U.S.  resident, and employment profile.<br><br><em>Contacting FM</em><br>You  may also contact FM by filling out and submitting a form through a Site,  or by submitting feedback when you are logged in to a Site. When you  contact FM through a Site, your full name and email address are  transmitted to FM. Any other information you choose to include in the  form you submit would also be transferred to and stored on FM’s servers.<br><br><em>Anonymous Information</em><br>We  also collect "Anonymous Information", such as traffic statistics and  general usage patterns regarding page views, dates and times you use the  Site, the website that referred you to the Site, and the method by  which you accessed the Site, files accessed through the Site, responses  sent to the browser, the length of data sent to the browser, and other  data used in the communication between browser and Sites. FM does not  use cookies to collect information about your activities on any of our  Sites.<br><br><em>How We Use the Information we Collect</em><br>We call  information you provide that can be used to locate or identify you  "Personally Identifiable Information." We use it to provide our Services  and to communicate with you regarding such Services. We may also use  your Personally Identifiable Information to provide information you have  requested or products you have purchased (e.g., membership updates,  e-mail newsletters, advertising insertion orders), to resolve disputes,  collect fees, and troubleshoot problems. We also may use your Personally  Identifiable Information: to respond to specific inquiries made by you;  to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce  our Terms of Use; and to customize, measure, and improve our Services,  content, and layout. In addition, the FM Network analyzes and uses your  Personally Identifiable Information — and supplements it with other  information we obtain — to notify you and target advertising to you  regarding special offers, products, services, and information that we  think may be of interest to you, and to measure the advertising  effectiveness of advertisements on our Sites and Publisher Properties.<br><br>We  use your Anonymous Information for the purposes of system  administration, providing certain site functionality and content,  targeted advertising, site tracking, and collecting and reporting  aggregate usage information. We may combine Anonymous Information with  your personally identifiable information to notify you of special offers  and target advertising and other content to you.<br><br><em>Phishing</em><br>We  do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information,  your username, login password, or national identification numbers in a  non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. Identity  theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great  concern to FM. Safeguarding information to help protect you from  identity theft is our top priority. For more information about phishing,  you may want to visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website at  http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts phishingalrt.htm.<br><br><em>Information Sharing</em><br>Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties.<br><br><em>Posting</em><br>Any  information voluntarily disclosed by users and posted on our site (on  message boards, web logs, and/or in chat areas) may be viewed and used  by others. If you post personal information that is accessible to the  public online, you do so at your own risk. Be aware that you may receive  unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Third Party Service  Providers<br>We engage certain trusted third parties to perform various  functions and provide services to us (for example, web hosting services  and maintenance services). These third parties may have access to some  of your Personally Identifiable Information, but only to the extent  necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only  pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third  parties to maintain the privacy and security of your Personally  Identifiable Information.<br><br><em>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</em><br>We  may choose to disclose some or all of your Personally Identifiable  Information to the government, law enforcement officials, or private  parties if we, in our sole discretion, believe it necessary or  appropriate to comply with the law, to respond to legal complaints, to  comply with legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the rights  of FM or a third party, to ensure the safety of the public or any  person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally  questionable activity.<br><br><em>Changes in Corporate Ownership</em><br>If  any or all of the assets of FM are acquired by, or merged with, another  entity we will share some or all of your Personally Identifiable  Information with that entity.<br><br><em>Accessing and Changing Your Information</em><br>You  may always access and modify certain of your Personally Identifiable  Information you provide through FM’s self-service e-commerce platform by  visiting the "sign in" area at the FM Domain. You may or may not be  able to modify the Personally Identifiable Information you provide  through other parts of the FM Domain or other Sites. If this causes  concern, please contact us at the e-mail address provided below and we  will provide information for the specific Site you reference.<br><br><em>Security</em><br>We  place great importance on the safety and security of your Personally  Identifiable Information. We employ certain physical, procedural, and  technological measures in an attempt to protect your Personally  Identifiable Information from unauthorized access and use. FM’s servers  that contain Personally Identifiable Information are stored in an  off-site facility. FM also uses hashed passwords, which allows an  algorithmic version of your password to be stored instead of you actual  password. When receiving financial information (e.g., PayPal account  IDs) for completing certain online transactions, including those in  connection with the FM self-service platform, our site uses SSL or  "Secure Sockets Layer," an industry standard security protocol, though  other communications through the Sites are not encrypted. Although we do  attempt to keep your Personally Identifiable Information secure, no  security measures are perfect; there is always a possibility that a  security breach could occur, resulting in the release of Personally  Identifiable Information.<br><br><em>Links to Other Sites</em><br>Each  FM Site may contain links to other websites, including but not limited  to Publisher Properties, in several places. You should pay particular  attention to which website you are visiting when submitting any  personally identifiable information to these websites. This Privacy  Policy addresses the use and disclosure of only that information that we  collect from you through our various Sites. Different rules may apply  to information you submit to other websites including Publisher  Properties, and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these  websites.<br><br><em>Our Policy Toward Children</em><br>None of our  Sites are directed toward persons under eighteen years of age. If a  parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us  with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or  she should contact us at privacypolicy@federatedmedia.net . If we become  aware that a child under thirteen has provided us with personally  identifiable information, we will remove such information from our  files.</p>
