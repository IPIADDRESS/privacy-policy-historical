			<a name="security"></a>
			<p class="maroon font_big">Security</p> 

			<p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received.

			<a name="minors"></a>
			<p class="maroon font_big">How we protect minors</p> 

			<p>There are 2 age groups in the game, adults and minors. Users in the same group (adults-adults and minors-minors) can fully communicate with each other. Users in different groups (adults-minors or minors-adults) are not able to lock, raise, wishlist eachother, exchange private messages, gifts, nudges, friend requests and their communication is limited to public only so that it can be screened by our content moderators.</p>
			
			<p> In addition, an adult can not delete his/her messages from a minor's wall. We are also actively monitoring the validity of users' birthdate and we remove users who set a false birthdate without any prior warning since protecting minors is our highest priority.</p> 
			
			<p>In short, anything that may create an unattended and permanent connection to a minor is disabled. All these measures (including blocking adult/spammy/unsafe sites/images) along with 24/7 moderation and parental guidance which is required when minors are exploring the internet, make the game a safer place for all.</p>
