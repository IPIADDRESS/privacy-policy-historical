          <p>During the registration process for, or while using, any of the FFN Websites, you may choose to provide us with certain "Personal Information" including:</p><p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>your name and email address,</li>
              <li>billing information,</li>
              <li>"Sensitive Personal Information", which includes your racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>When we refer to "Personal Information" in this Policy, unless we say otherwise, this includes "Sensitive Personal Information."</p>
          <p>We may also collect information about your activities or postings on FFN Website when you choose to send us personal correspondence such as emails or letters or when other FFN Website users or third parties send us correspondence, which may include their comments about you. All this information will be kept in a file that is accessed only by authorized FFN personnel or representatives.</p>
          <p>On some of the FFN Websites, you may choose to use our referral service to tell a friend or friends about us. In this case, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address and email your friend an invite to him or her to visit an FFN Website.</p>
          <p>Providing your Personal Information to us is voluntary. However, if you do not provide your Personal Information to us, you will not be able to access some or all of our services.</p>
          <p><a id="sec2_2" name="sec2_2"></a><span class="p-title">How do We Use Your Information?</span></p>
          <p>When you provide Personal Information to us, we will use it to contact you about our services, to process payment for our services, and to tailor our services to your meet your preferences.</p>
          <p>We use your Personal Information for many specific purposes, including:</p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>emailing you with news and updates about the FFN Websites</li>
              <li>improving and customizing our content and product offerings</li>
              <li>analyzing FFN Website usage and delivering information (such as banners and promotions) targeted to your interests</li>
              <li>providing you with information about the products and services provided by the FFN Websites or third parties</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>If you have provided us with certain Personal Information, we will also use it to facilitate your communication with other members, for example, by the use of the message center or delivery of "Cupid Reports" or "Ice Breakers". </p>
          <p>We may also use your Personal Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, enforce any agreements, policies and rules governing the use of FFN Websites, and observe the FFN Websites for quality control and customer service purposes. </p>
          <p>If you use our referral services, we will use your friend's name and email address only to send an invitation and to track the status of the referral. Your friend(s) may use the unsubscribe function in the email or contact us at privacy@friendfindernetworks.com to request that we remove their email address from our records. </p>
          <p><a id="sec2_3" name="sec2_3"></a><span class="p-title">When and to Whom Will We Disclose Your Information?</span></p>
          <p>Due to the nature of many of the services provided by the FFN Websites, certain of your Personal Information will be disclosed to other Members. As an example, if you complete a "dating" profile and choose to disclose your religious affiliation or ethnic origin, this information will be available to other Members using the services on the applicable FFN Website. By providing this type of profile information to us, you have consented to the use and disclosure of your Personal Information in this manner.</p>
          <p>We may share or transfer your Personal Information with our subsidiaries operating other FFN Websites so that they can send you information about their products or services that you may be interested in. </p>
          <p>We also disclose Personal Information to our service providers (for example, credit card processing companies, billing services) as reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide services on the FFN Websites. Our service providers are legally required by us to protect your Personal Information. Because many of the FFN Websites operate or use service providers located in different countries, your Personal Information may be transferred to a country in which you do not reside, and while in that foreign country, may be accessible to its law enforcement authorities. </p>
          <p>We may be required to disclose your Personal Information in order to comply with a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or as otherwise compelled by law. In addition, we expressly reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, to enforce our agreements, policies, and rules governing your use of the FFN Websites, to cooperate with law enforcement, and/or to report information concerning a threat of serious injury or death.</p>
          <p>We DO NOT sell or rent any of your Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission or consent. We may, however, disclose to third-party advertisers certain aggregated or hashed (i.e., encrypted) information in a manner that no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user, for other marketing and promotional purposes. </p>
          <p>When you provide your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information to us, you consent to our use and disclosure of that information as described in this Policy. If you do not want us to use or disclose your Personal Information as described in this Policy, do not provide it to us. We note that this may result in you being unable to access some or all of our services. </p>

          <p>FFN Websites use "cookies" to store and sometimes track information to make your online experience easier and more personalized. </p>
          <p>Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's web browser on the user's storage drive. Cookies may record information that is accessed by a user on a webpage in order to simplify subsequent interactions with that website by the same user, or to streamline the user's transactions on related webpages. Cookies make it easier for a user to move from webpage to webpage and to complete transactions over the Internet. </p>
          <p>Most major web browsers are set up so that they will initially accept cookies, but you may modify your computer's preferences to issue you an alert when a cookie is downloaded, or to disable the ability of third parties to download a cookie to you. If you choose to reject all cookies, there are areas of FFN Websites that may not function properly. You may obtain further information about cookies and how they function at: <a href="http://friendfinder.com/p/offsite.cgi?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie</a>.</p>
          <p>We, or a data provider or advertiser that we have engaged, may also place or recognize a cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. These cookies contain no Personal Information. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data that is linked to data that you have voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with the data provider or advertiser solely in a hashed (i.e., non-human readable) format.

          <p>We may also use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons or 1x1 "gifs" and other similar technologies (collectively "Pixel Tags"). A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Members and may be associated with cookies on the Members' storage drives. We use Pixel Tags to track your use of the FFN Websites, for advertising, marketing, or promotional purposes, and to determine whether you opened an email message from us. The information also enables us to customize the services we offer. </p>
          <p>Other parties may collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use FFN Services. We honor web browser "do not track" signals that provide you with the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of Personal Information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services, when the web browser's http header includes the field "dnt:1". We do not presently honor any other types of "Do Not Track" mechanism.</p>

We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your Personal Information to others. Similarly, you should never disclose or share your password with anyone else.

          <p>FFN is located in the United States. If you are visiting any of the FFN Websites from outside the United States, you must be aware that your Personal Information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States or other countries in which FFN or its service providers are located. The data protection and other laws of the United States and these other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, and your Personal Information may be accessible to law enforcement authorities in the United States or of other countries.</p>
          <p>When you use the FFN Websites, you consent to us transferring your Personal Information (which includes, for the avoidance of doubt, your Sensitive Personal Information) from your country to the United States or countries in which the FFN or its service providers are located for the purposes described in this Policy.</p>

          <p>You have the right to ask in writing whether we hold any Personal Information about you, and to see that information as well as how we collect, use or disclose your Personal Information. We note that we may not be able to provide you with all of the information you request, depending on the circumstances (e.g., if it contains the Personal Information of other Members). There may be a charge for any copy of Personal Information requested. </p>
          <p>Upon your request, we will remove your credit card number, credit card expiration date and other Personal Information from our main databases. We note that, despite your request, we may retain in our files certain data (including credit card information) if necessary to:</p>

          <p></p>
          <p>We note that despite our best efforts to remove information from our database on your request, removed information may exist in backup copies or other users' caches.

Whether your exchanged information is kept by another Member is beyond the control of FFN. </p>
