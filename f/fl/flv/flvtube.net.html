<p align="right"><strong>Version 1.0  dated September 1, 2010&nbsp; </strong></p>
<h1><p align="center"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p></h1>
<p>This Website Privacy Policy (this “<u>Policy</u>”) applies with respect  to the information that Design and Marketing DM S.A., a Costa Rican corporation  (“<u>D&amp;M</u>”, “<u>we</u>” or “<u>us</u>”), collects  from the <a href="http://www.installmanager.com">www.installmanager.com</a> web site (the "<u>Site</u>"),  and explains how we collect,  use and disclose your personal information. Amendments to this Policy will be  posted at this URL. Your continued use of this Site following the posting of  any amendment, modification or change shall constitute your acceptance  thereof.&nbsp; While we may update you of any  changes to this Policy, it is your obligation to review the terms of this  Policy and stay current therewith.</p>
<h3><p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong></p></h3>
<p>Out Site collects two types of information about you: (a) information  that you provide or that we gather with your permission that personally  identifies you; and (b) information that does not personally identify you, that  we automatically collect when you visit the Site or that you provide to us. </p>
<p>Our definition of personally identifiable information  includes any information that may be used to specifically identify or contact  you, such as your name, email address or phone number. It also includes the  type of software that you use or have on your computer system, which we may  learn about if you request us to scan your computer for outdated software  (which involves scanning your computer system to determine what software and  software versions you may use or have on your computer system and, based upon  the results of such scan, recommending software update and other products for  download and/or purchase).&nbsp; In certain  circumstances, we may gather, request, allow or otherwise provide you an  opportunity to submit your personally identifiable information in connection  with a feature, program, promotion or some other aspect of our Site. For  instance, you may: (a) provide your name, mail/shipping address, email address,  credit card number and phone number when registering with our Site or using our  online store; (b) provide certain demographic information about you (e.g., age,  gender, purchase preference, usage frequency, etc.) when participating in a  survey, poll or joining a club; (c) post a product rating and recommendation on  our Site; or (d) authorize us to scan your computer to determine the type of  software you use or otherwise have on your computer system, so that we  recommend software updates or products for download and/or purchase. Certain  information may not be personally identifiable when standing alone (e.g., your  age), but may become so when combined with other information (e.g., your age  and name). Whether or not you provide this information is your choice; however,  in many instances this type of information is required to participate in the  particular activity, realize a benefit we may offer, or gain access to certain  content on our Site.</p>
<p>Our definition of non-personal information is any  information that does not personally identify you. We obtain non-personal  information about you from information that you provide us, either separately  or together with your personally identifiable information. We also  automatically collect certain non-personal information from you when you access  our Site. Non-personal information can include, among other things, IP  addresses, the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox,  Safari, etc, the third party website from which your visit originated, the  operating system you are using (e.g., Vista, Windows XP, Macintosh OS, etc.),  the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online,  NetZero, etc.), the search terms you use on our Site, the specific web pages  you visit, and the duration of your visits.</p>
<p class="left">[<a href="#">Top</a>]</p>
<h3><p><strong>HOW WE USE,  DISCLOSE&nbsp; AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br></p></h3>
  We use non-personal information  in a variety of ways, including to help analyze Site traffic, understand  customer needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional activities, and to  improve our services. We may use your non-personal information by itself or  aggregate it with information we have obtained from others. We may share your  non-personal information with our affiliated companies and third parties to  achieve these objectives and others.<br>
  The personally identifiable  information your provide to us is generally used to carry out your requests,  respond to your inquiries, better serve you, or in other ways related to the  circumstances in which you provided the information. We may also use this  information to later contact you for a variety of reasons, such as customer  service, providing you promotional information for our products or those of our  affiliated companies, or to communicate with you about content or other  information you have posted or shared with us via our Site. We may also provide  your information to third parties who may contract you to promote their  products and services. You may opt-out from receiving future promotional  information from us or our affiliated companies, or direct that we not share  your information with any affiliated companies, as set forth below. <br>
  In certain instances we may  also share your personally identifiable information with our third party vendors  performing functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our affiliated companies).  Our vendors agree to use this information, and we share information with them,  only to carry out our requests. In addition, we may share your personally  identifiable information with participating sponsors to a program or promotion  (e.g., a sweepstakes or contest) you enter via our Site, and with third parties  who assist us in using the content or other information you have posted or  shared with us via our Site. Further, we may share your personally identifiable  information with third parties such as our co-promotional partners and others  with whom we have marketing or other relationships.<br>
  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Policy to the contrary, we  reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable or non-personal  information about you if we are required to do so by law, with respect to  notices and counternotices pursuant to our Digital Millennium Copyright Act  notice and takedown policy and procedures and/or if we believe that such action  is necessary to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the  requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our legal  rights or property, our Site, or other users; or (d) in an emergency to protect  the health and safety of our Site’s users or the general public.<p></p>
<h3><strong>COOKIES AND IP  ADDRESSES</strong></h3>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard  drive, not on our Site. We use cookies for a number of reasons. First, cookies  allow you to store your password without having to constantly re-enter it.  Second, cookies can also help us to tailor our Site or a marketing message to  better match your needs and interests. Third, cookies allow us to better  understand how users use our Site, which in turn helps us focus our resources  on features that are most popular with our users. You are always free to  decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our Site may not  work properly if you do.</p>
<p>An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your  computer whenever you are surfing the Internet. Web servers (computers that  "serve up" web pages) automatically identify your computer by its IP  address. When visitors request pages from our Site, our servers typically log  their IP addresses. We collect IP addresses for purposes of system  administration, to report non-personal aggregate information to others, and to  track the use of our Site. IP addresses are considered non-personal information  and may also be shared as provided above. It is not our practice to link IP  addresses to anything personally identifiable. However, we reserve the right to  use IP addresses to identify a visitor when we feel it is necessary to enforce  compliance with our Site rules or to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b)  conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or  defend our legal rights or property, our Site, or other users; or (d) in an  emergency to protect the health and safety of our Site users or the general  public.</p>

<h3><strong>OTHER SITES</strong></h3>
<p>Our Site contains links to other Websites.&nbsp; Because this Policy only applies to the Site  itself and not linked Websites, you should examine the privacy policy of any  other Websites that you access from the Site. We are not responsible for the  privacy practices or the content of such other Websites.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3><p><strong>PUBLIC FORUMS</strong><br></p></h3>
  We may offer chat rooms,  message boards, bulletin boards, or similar public forums where you and other  users of our Website can communicate. The protections described in this Policy  do not apply when you provide information (including personal information) in  connection with your use of these public forums. We may use personally  identifiable and non-personal information about you to identify you with a  posting in a public forum. Any information you share in a public forum is  public information and may be seen or collected by anyone, including third  parties that do not adhere to this Policy. We are not responsible for events  arising from the distribution of any information you choose to publicly post or  share through our Site.<br>
 <h3> <strong>CHILDREN</strong><br></h3>
  We do not knowingly collect or use any  personal information from children under the age of 13 without obtaining  verifiable parental consent. <br>

  We will respond to your request and, if applicable and  appropriate, make the requested change in our active databases as soon as  reasonably practicable. Please note that we may not be able to fulfill certain  requests while allowing you access to certain benefits and features of our  Site.<br>
  <h3><strong>SECURITY</strong><p></p></h3>
<p>While there is no such thing as "absolute security" on the  Internet, we make good faith efforts to ensure the safety of your personal  information, whenever reasonably possible.</p>
<h3><p><strong>SALE OF BUSINESS  &nbsp;</strong></p></h3>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer information to a third  party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially  all of the assets of D&amp;M provided that the third party agrees to adhere to  the terms of this Policy. </p>
