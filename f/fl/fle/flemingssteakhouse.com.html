<h4 id="collect-info">WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h4>
<p>We collect information about you in a number of ways, including when you register for an account on our website, open a loyalty program account, purchase gift cards, or make purchases in our restaurants, online dining reservations, online food orders, as well as when you use our website and mobile applications, Facebook page, Twitter account, YouTube or other social media and online platforms.

We use technology, including cookies (a piece of data that is placed on your computer when you visit a website) to automatically collect certain information, as described above, that we then use for system administration and website maintenance, troubleshooting, and to identify you when you open our email or visit our website through your computer or mobile device so we can enhance your online experience and make our advertising more relevant. We may also offer certain features that are only available through the use of this technology.</p>
<p>You can set your browser to accept or reject cookies and to disable other tracking technology. Third-party sites may also provide additional opt-out methods.</p>

<p>We may use third parties to serve advertisements on other websites. In serving these advertisements, these companies may use cookies and other tracking devices to collect certain information about your visits to other websites (such as browser type, IP address, which page was visited, and time of day). This information may be used to evaluate our online advertising campaigns or to tailor promotions and other marketing messages to you.</p>

        <li>fulfilling requests for products and services, improving our services, conducting research, and providing anonymous reporting for internal and external clients;</li>
        <li>assisting in providing our services (for example, to process credit and debit card transactions, conduct</li>
        statistical analyses, and to comply with unsubscribe lists); and assisting with loss prevention in cases of suspected fraud or theft.
        <li>Provide your information to any company who may purchase some or all of Fleming's assets in the future; and</li>
        <li>Enforce the incorporated policies and Terms and Conditions of use, to comply with legal obligations, and otherwise manage our business.</li>

    </li>
</ul>
<p>Fleming's may combine personal and non-personal information we collect or obtain with other information we obtain from third parties. We may transfer your information to Fleming's partners and affiliates for this purpose. Fleming's may also share aggregated information that cannot be used to identify you with our clients and business partners.</p>
<h4>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?</h4>
<p>We work to protect your information both online and offline by using appropriate technical, administrative and physical procedures to protect personal information from loss, misuse, or alteration.</p>
<p>We limit access to personal information to those who have a business need. Employees who violate Fleming's customer privacy safeguards are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>
<p>When we share your information with third-party service providers as described above, we only provide those third parties with the information necessary to perform their service and we require that they protect your information and not use it for any other purpose. We cannot, however, ensure or guarantee the security of any information you send to us and you do so at your own risk. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your passwords and any account information.</p>
<h4 id="choices-info">WHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION?</h4>

<p>Under rare circumstances Fleming's may need to contact some or all users to relay important information about our website or restaurants. Members are not able to unsubscribe or “opt in/opt out“ of these announcements because they may contain very important information regarding their accounts. Fleming's reserves the right to contact users to correct account errors or to supply important information Fleming's deems relevant.</p>

<p>You may change certain personal information or request that we delete your personal information by:</p>

Please include your current contact information, the information you are interested in accessing, and your requested changes. We will provide access and make the changes you request, or provide an explanation of what actions we will be able to make in response to your request.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you ask us to delete your personal information, we may need to retain a record of certain personal information to comply with applicable federal, state or local law.</p>
<h4>ACCOUNT</h4>
<p>If our website allows visitors to register for an account, you may register for an account that is accessible by a password of your choosing. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify Fleming's of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security known to you.</p>
<h4>OTHER SITES</h4>
<p>Our website may include links to websites operated by other companies, which may or may not be co-branded. Fleming's is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites or other services operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with our services or for the privacy practices of any third party. Once you leave our website via such a link, access a third-party application, or click on a third-party offer, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine, among other things, how they will handle any personal information they collect from you.</p>
<h4>INFORMATION ABOUT CHILDREN</h4>
<p>We strive to create an online and offline environment that is respectful of families. In that light we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.</p>
<p>If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed personally identifiable information to us, please contact us. A parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 may review and request deletion of the child's personally identifiable information and prohibit its use.</p>
<h4>POLICY EFFECTIVENESS AND CHANGES</h4>
<p>By using our website, using our mobile applications or otherwise providing us with your personal information, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Additionally, this Privacy Policy incorporates our Terms of Use. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it from time to time.
