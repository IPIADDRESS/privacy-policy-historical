                            resources on the World Wide Web. For example, http://www.Waterpark Flex is the

                            2 An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control
                            Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks
                            use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination.
                            In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your
                            computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify
                            your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate
                            on the Internet, browse and shop.
