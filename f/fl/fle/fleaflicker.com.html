It is Fleaflicker's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.</p><h4>Website Visitors</h4><p>Like most website operators, Fleaflicker collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Fleaflicker's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Fleaflicker's visitors use its website.</p><p>Fleaflicker also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments. Fleaflicker only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p><h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4><p>Certain visitors to Fleaflicker's websites choose to interact with Fleaflicker in ways that require Fleaflicker to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Fleaflicker gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at Fleaflicker.com to provide a username and email address. Fleaflicker collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Fleaflicker. Fleaflicker does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p><p>For visitors purchasing premium ugprades, we collect your credit card number, security code, and expiration date to charge you. We immediately pass this data to our payment processor who charges credit cards on our behalf, and then destroy all copies of credit card information instantly. All communication between you and us and between us and the payment processor happens under bank-grade encryption, so that your credit card details cannot be intercepted by anyone.</p><h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4><p>Fleaflicker may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Fleaflicker does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p><h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4><p>Fleaflicker discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Fleaflicker's behalf or to provide services available at Fleaflicker's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Fleaflicker's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Fleaflicker will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Fleaflicker discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Fleaflicker believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Fleaflicker, third parties or the public at large. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Fleaflicker takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p><h4>Cookies</h4><p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Fleaflicker uses cookies to help Fleaflicker identify and track visitors, their usage of Fleaflicker website, and their website access preferences. Fleaflicker visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Fleaflicker's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Fleaflicker's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies (specifically, users will not be able to sign in and use their Account).</p><h4>Business Transfers</h4><p>If Fleaflicker, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the very unlikely event that Fleaflicker goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and, to enable continued service to you in the event of such a transfer, that any acquiror of Fleaflicker may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p><h4>Ads</h4><p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Fleaflicker and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p><h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4><p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Fleaflicker may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Fleaflicker's sole discretion.
