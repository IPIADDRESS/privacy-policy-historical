<p>American Media, LLC, Weider Publications, LLC, Radar Online LLC, and AMI Celebrity Publications, LLC (collectively, “we”, “us” or “our”) own and operate websites, mobile applications, and other digital, interactive services (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy applies to the information we collect through the Services, unless the website, mobile application, or other digital, interactive service has a separate privacy policy, in which case that privacy policy will govern.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms of Use posted on our Services, sets forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Services. Depending on your activities when visiting our Services, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>
<p>This policy describes:</p>
<ol><li>The information we collect and how we collect it;</li>
<li>What we do with the information we collect;</li>
<li>How we share your information;</li>
<li>Exercising choice;</li>
<li>California Privacy Rights;</li>
<li>How you can access and update your information;</li>
<li>User based in EEA and Switzerland;</li>
<li>Security of Personal Data;</li>
<li>Retention of Your Personal Data;</li>
<li>Children;</li>
<li>Links to Third Parties; and</li>
<li>Changes to Privacy Policy.</li>
</ol><h4 role="presentation">1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
<p>Our Services typically collect three kinds of information about you: (a) information that you voluntarily provide that personally identifies you, including financial information; (b) information that we automatically collect when you use our Services; and (c) information provided by third parties.</p>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the websites you visit, the activities in which you participate and the Services you use. You can use some of the Services without providing any information other than what is automatically collected as described below.</p>
<h4 role="presentation">Information you provide</h4>
<p>We may collect information about you during your use of the Services, including your name, username, password, email address, postal address, phone number, mobile phone number, payment information, gender, birth year, and information you provide or post on our Services or allow us to access when you do certain things, such as:</p>
<ul><li>Enter registration information for one or more of our Services;</li>
<li>Enter a sweepstakes or contest or register for a promotion;</li>
<li>Participate in voting or polling activities;</li>
<li>Make a purchase;</li>
<li>Request certain features (e.g., newsletters, updates, and other products);</li>
<li>Sign up to receive SMS (text message) notifications;</li>
<li>Download or use one of our mobile applications;</li>
<li>Connect with the Services or otherwise allow us to access certain information about you via a social networking site (SNS); or</li>
<li>Post user-generated content, including comments, to or on any of our Services.</li>
</ul><h4 role="presentation">Automatically-collected information</h4>
<p><em>Device/usage information</em></p>
<p>We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Services. For example, we may collect and analyze information such as (a) IP addresses, geolocation information (as described in the next section below), unique device identifiers and other information about your mobile phone or other mobile device(s), browser types, browser language, operating system, the state or country from which you accessed the Services; and (b) information related to the ways in which you interact with the Services, such as: referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used the Services, the frequency of your use of the Services, error logs, and other similar information. As described further below, we may use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting and analyzing this information.</p>
<p>We may also capture other data, such as search criteria and results. In some cases, we will associate this information with a unique identifier for our internal use.</p>
<p><em>Location information</em></p>
<p>We may collect different types of information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Services), and may use that information to customize the Services with location-based information, advertising, and features. By using our Services, you consent to the collection of location information.</p>
<p>If you access the Services through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See your device manufacturer’s instructions for further details.</p>
<p><em>Cookies and Local Stored Objects</em></p>
<p>To enhance your experience on our Services, we place "cookies" on your computer or device. Cookies are small text files that we place in your computer or device to store your preferences. Other information you provide to us may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. A cookie assigns a unique numerical identifier to your Web browser or device, and may enable us to recognize you as the same user who has used our Services, and relate your use of the Services to other information about you.</p>
<p>We use session and performance cookies to provide you with the services you request and to improve your experience with our Services. For example, we use cookies to personalize your experience on our Services (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site, to save your password in password-protected areas, to enable shopping carts, or to tailor content or product and service offerings). Other cookies are essential to ensure the security and operation of our Services.</p>
<p>We also use cookies (and Local Shared Objects, HTML5, cache cookies, web beacons, or clear gifs, all described further below) to understand usage of the Services, analyze traffic, and to improve our content and offerings.</p>
<p>Some third parties, such as Google, may place cookies on your browser when you use our Services in order to track your activity across websites and to provide you advertisements tailored to your interests and online activities. For more information on how to opt out of Online Behavioral Advertising, see the Exercising Choice section below. For our European based users, we only place or allow tracking cookies to be placed on your browser with your consent.</p>
<p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies. You can set your browser option so that you will not receive cookies and you can also delete existing cookies from your browser.</p>
<p><em>Information from third parties</em></p>
<p>We may obtain additional information about you from third parties such as marketers, partners, researchers, and others. We may combine information that we collect from you with information about you that we obtain from such third parties and information derived from any other subscription, product, or service we provide.</p>
<p><em>Aggregate or de-identified data</em></p>
<p>We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information is not intended to identify you. Our use and disclosure of aggregated and/or de-identified information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation for any purpose.</p>
<h4 role="presentation">2. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</h4>
<p>In general, we use the personally identifiable information that we collect to provide you with the services, including the following based on our legitimate interests:</p>

<li>To perform analytics and research aimed at improving the accuracy, effectiveness, usability, or popularity of the Services;</li>
<li>To improve the content and features of the Services or develop new Services;</li>

<li>To enforce the legal terms that govern your use of the Services;</li>
<li>To administer and troubleshoot the Services; and</li>
<li>To associate your activities, customize content or tailor advertising across different devices and browsers that you use to access the Services (for instance, computers, tablets, mobile devices, applications and websites).</li>
</ul><h4 role="presentation">3. HOW WE MAY SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
<p>We will make your information available to other companies, websites, applications or people with your consent, or consistent with our legitimate interests, in the circumstances described below:</p>
<ul><li>We may rent, sell, or share your information with non-affiliated third parties: (a) in order to provide services or products that we believe may be of interest to you; (b) when we have your permission; or (c) as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>We may share your information with our agents or companies in order to provide the Services or advertising or to communicate with you on our behalf.</li>
<li>When you sign up to participate in a contest or sweepstakes, your information may also be provided to our sweepstakes or contest advertisers, operators, and/or sponsors and the use of that information will be also governed by the privacy policies or practices of those advertisers, operators, and/or sponsors.</li>
<li>We may disclose your information in response to any subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process we receive, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims.</li>
<li>We may share your information with third-parties with whom we have a contractual relationship, including without limitation third-party advertisers and advertising networks.</li>
<li>We may disclose your information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is appropriate in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service for the Services you accessed, and/or to protect our rights and property, and the rights and property of our employees, users and the public. This may involve sharing your information with law enforcement, government agencies, courts, and/or other organizations.</li>
<li>We may share your information in connection with any proposed or actual merger, reorganization, transfer of control, a sale of some or all of our assets, or a financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.</li>
<li>We may aggregate and/or de-identify your information so that the information no longer relates to you individually. Our use and disclosure of such aggregated or de-identified information is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and may be disclosed to others without limitation and for any purpose.</li>
</ul><h4 role="presentation">4. EXERCISING CHOICE</h4>
<p><strong>Promotional Emails</strong></p>
<p>You may opt-out from receiving future promotional emails from us, or direct that we not share your information with any Affiliated Companies, by clicking the "unsubscribe" button that appears on our promotional e-mails. Please refer to the settings or options menu in your email client for more information. You can remove yourself from our postal mailings by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@amilink.com">privacy@amilink.com</a>.

<p><strong>Online Behavioral Advertising</strong></p>
<p>When you use the Services, we may serve you with ads based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide such as your age or gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content and other information that you provide to us.</p>
<p>Some of the services and advertisements are delivered or served by third-party companies. These companies place or recognize cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other technology to track certain information about our Services website users. For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, an advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of the Services. For another example, an advertiser or ad server may also be able to collect your device’s unique identifier in the course of serving an ad. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests.</p>
<p>We do not have access to, nor control over, these third parties' use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used.</p>
<p>For example, we use Google to serve advertisements on the Services, which use the Google Doubleclick cookie, and in some cases, a unique device identifier, to show you ads based on your visit to our websites and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the Google Doubleclick cookie by visiting the <u><a href="https://adssettings.google.com/">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a></u>.</p>
<p>If you would like more information about this practice, and to learn how to opt out of behavioral advertising on the particular device on which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, please visit <u><a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#/">http://optout.aboutads.info/#/</a></u> and <u><a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#</a></u>. You may download the AppChoices app at <u><a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices">http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a></u> to opt out in mobile apps.</p>
<p>Please note that the opt out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer and browser on which the opt out is applied. If you delete your browser cookies and want to continue to be opted out of interest-based ads, you will need to opt out again.</p>
<p>For more information about how we use cookies please visit our <a href="https://www.americanmediainc.com/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
<h4 role="presentation">Precise Device Location Tracking</h4>
<p>If you authorized us and/or our service providers to collect and/or share information about the precise location of your device through a mobile application, you can always withdraw your consent and prevent the further collection and sharing of your precise device location information by accessing your devices location privacy settings. Each operating system, iOS for Apple devices, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices, provides its own instructions on how to turn off precise location sharing.

<h4 role="presentation">Individual Rights</h4>
<p><em>Right to Know About Personal Information Collected, Disclosed, or Sold</em></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we disclose the Personal Information it collects, uses, and discloses about you to third parties. There are two types of Right to Know requests you can make:</p>
<ol><li>Right to Know (Abbreviated Request): If you make a Right to Know (Abbreviated Request), you will receive the following information about you:<br><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;"><li>Category of personal information collected,</li>
<li>Categories of sources from which that information was collected,</li>
<li>The business or commercial purpose(s) for which the information was collected,</li>
<li>The categories of third parties to whom we sold or disclosed the category of personal information for a business purpose, and</li>
<li>The business or commercial purpose for which we sold or disclosed the category of personal information.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Right to Know (Specific Pieces of Information Request): If you make a Right to Know (Specific Pieces of Information Request), you will receive the following information about you:<br><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;"><li>Specific pieces of Personal Information collected about you.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><p>We do not sell any Personal Information of California consumers. This information will be provided to you free of charge, unless we determine that your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. You may request this information twice in a 12-month period.</p>
<p><em>Right of Deletion</em></p>
<p>You have the right to request that our service providers and we delete any Personal Information about yourself that we have collected from you upon receipt of a verifiable request. This right is subject to exceptions.</p>
<p><em>Submitting Requests</em></p>
<p>You can submit your request by calling us at <strong>1 (888) 914-9661</strong>. You may also submit a request through a webform available by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@amilink.com">privacy@amilink.com</a>.</p>
<p><em>Verifying Requests</em></p>
<p>We provide California Consumers with the ability to submit requests through our request website, our telephone number, and our email address. We must verify that the person requesting information or deletion is the California Consumer about whom the request relates in order to process the request. To verify a California Consumer’s identity, we may request up to up to three pieces of Personal Information about you when you make a request to compare against our records. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in your request to verify your identity and will delete any information you provide after processing the request. We reserve the right to take additional steps as necessary to verify the identity of California Consumers where we have reason to believe a request is fraudulent.</p>
<p><em>Authorized Agent</em></p>
<p>You may choose a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf to submit your requests (“Authorized Agent”). If you choose to use an Authorized Agent, we require that you provide the Authorized Agent with written permission to allow them to submit your request and that you verify your identity directly with us. Failure to do so may result in us denying your request.</p>
<p><em>Right to Equal Service</em></p>
<p>We will not discriminate against you because you exercised any of your rights, including, but not limited to, by:</p>
<ul><li>Denying goods or services to you.</li>
<li>Charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties.</li>
<li>Providing a different level or quality of goods or services to you.</li>
<li>Suggesting that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
