You can visit our site and use most of our services without having to tell us who you are or reveal any personally identifiable information to us. There are, however, a few instances where we do collect personally identifiable information in order to fulfill your request. <br>
<p></p>
<p>Whenever you visit Flurl, our web server logs automatically receive and record anonymous information from your web browser including your IP Address, Flurl cookie information, the Flurl page(s) you request, the time spent on each web page and any search terms you query. <br>
</p>
<p>Flurl uses this anonymous information to customize your experience on our site, to show you more relevant advertising messages, and to improve our services in general. This information allows other users to benefit from the quality searches you perform, ultimately receiving the most relevant, pertinent information. We ordinarily do not attempt to link this information to a specific person. </p>
<p>When you register to become a Member of the Flurl website, Flurl collects certain information such as your e-mail address, and your domain URL (collectively, "Membership Information").
