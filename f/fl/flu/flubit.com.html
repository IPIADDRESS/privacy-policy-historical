<h1>FLUBIT LIMITED - PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p>(flubit.com)</p>
<p>UPDATED: 21/05/2012</p>
<p>This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for the pre-launch data retrieval on www.Flubit.com If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Flubit Ltd by email.</p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong><br>
Flubit Ltd is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. This statement discloses Flubit Ltd's privacy practices and is incorporated into, and subject to the terms of, Flubit Ltd's Terms of Use. The purpose of this statement is to inform you as to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What kinds of information Flubit Ltd collects from users of the Flubit Ltd website and how such information is collected;</li>
  <li>How the information is used by Flubit Ltd;</li>
  <li>Whether Flubit Ltd discloses any user information to third parties;</li>
  <li>How you can access, update or delete any information collected about you by Flubit Ltd; and</li>
  <li>The security procedures implemented by Flubit Ltd to protect your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flubit Ltd may change this policy from time to time. If so, any such changes will be posted on this page, so that Flubit Ltd may keep its users informed of its information collection practices. Accordingly, we recommend that you consult this page frequently so that you are aware of our latest policy.</p>
<p><strong>2. How We Collect Information</strong><br>
  When you sign up to Flubit Ltd, we will ask you for an email address. When feasible, we do automatically collect your IP address.</p>
<p><strong>3. How We Use and Disclose Your Information</strong><br>
  We use your email to provide information to you, such as to notifications when our site changes, newsletters, emails that you request, or to personalise the site in accordance with your requests. We will provide you with directions in all emails and newsletters on how to be taken off our newsletter list.<br>
  As a general practice, we do not sell to, or share your personally identifiable information with third parties. So, for example, we do not sell your email address to spammers (phew!) or mass marketers. We may on occasion email offers to you of products and services in conjunction with our partners.</p>
<p><strong>4. Controlling or Changing Your Information</strong><br>
  You can access and update your contact information by emailing Flubit (helpme [at] flubit.com). However, to the extent that such information is also stored in other databases, we cannot always ensure that such corrections or deletions will immediately reach the other databases. Also, you cannot manually change your IP address, although we may change it automatically.</p>
<p><strong>5. Cookies and Other Tracking Methods</strong><br>
  Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our site. We use cookies on our site for a number of reasons. First, cookies can help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Second, cookies allow us to better understand how users use our site, which in turn helps us focus our resources on features that are most popular with our users. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly in that case.<br>
  In addition to using cookies, in some circumstances we may track or collect information about your activities on our site by the numeric address assigned to the computer you are using (your IP address) or by the URLs that you come from or leave to. This information is collected and shared with our partners in an aggregated, non-personally identifiable basis.</p>
<p><strong>6. Other Sites</strong><br>
  The Flubit Ltd website may contain links and references to other websites and organisations, including websites owned or operated by Flubit Ltd's advertisers/partners. Please note that different rules may apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by third party service providers or vendors or any other sites you encounter on the Internet (even if these sites are branded with our branding or framed by our site). We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to third parties.</p>
<p><strong>7. Limits on Our Abilities</strong><br>
  Although your privacy is very important to us, due to the existing legal and technical environment, we cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, we can (and you authorise us to) disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries.</p>
<p><strong>8. Security</strong><br>
  We use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers where appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>9. Further Questions</strong><br>
  Any further questions you have should be directed to: <a href="mailto:helpme@flubit.com">helpme [at] flubit.com</a></p>
