We will collect the relevant contact information of the gift recipient which may include name, address, and email address. We will use this third party information only for this service and not to market directly to the recipient unless the recipient is currently registered with Fly Holdings independently. To provide this service, we obtain address information of the gift recipient from third party sources, such as the US Postal Service, to verify the address so we can properly ship your gift order and to prevent fraud.</li>
	<li>Furthermore, when you use our Services, we receive and record information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, Fly Holdings cookie information, the type of software and hardware you are using and the web page(s) you visit.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sharing and Disclosing Information</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fly Holdings does not rent or sell personal information about you with third parties, however, we reserve the right to share the personal information we collect about you through our Services with third parties when we have your permission or under the circumstances described below.</li>
	<li>Fly Holdings may use the data we collect about you for the following purposes:

		<li>To provide you with the products or services you have requested from us or through our Services;</li>
		<li>To provide personal information, when required by law, in connection with security-related or law enforcement investigations, to comply with legal requirements, orders, or proceedings, to perform credit checks, report or collect debts owed, or to protect the rights or property of Fly Holdings, our employees, our members, and our Services;</li>
		<li>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Fly Holdings'&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fly.com">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>, or as otherwise required by law;</li>

The third parties that we have partnered with are required by contract to follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information they receive and/or process on our behalf. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and thus we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
