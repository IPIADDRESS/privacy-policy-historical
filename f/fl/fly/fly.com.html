	<li>When we refer to "personal information", what we mean is any information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, e-mail address, credit card information, precise location data, or phone number, and any other information that is not otherwise publicly available.</li>
	<li>This Policy does not apply to the practices of people or companies that Travelzoo does not own, control, employ or manage, except where incorporated by reference within licensing arrangements with third parties.</li>
	<li><b><i>Minors</i></b> - You must be at least 18 years old to register or subscribe for Travelzoo's Services because Travelzoo is available only to individuals who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law.</li>
</ul>

We will use this third party information only for this service and not to market directly to the recipient unless the recipient is currently registered with Travelzoo independently. To provide this service, we obtain address information of the gift recipient from third party sources, such as the US Postal Service, to verify the address so we can properly ship your gift order and to prevent fraud.</li>
	<li>Furthermore, when you use our Services, we receive and record information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, Travelzoo cookie information, the type of software and hardware you are using and the web page(s) you visit.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sharing and Disclosing Information</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Travelzoo does not rent or sell personal information about you with third parties, however, we reserve the right to share the personal information we collect about you through our Services with third parties when we have your permission or under the circumstances described below.</li>
	<li>Travelzoo may use the data we collect about you for the following purposes:
		<ul>
			<li>To provide you with the products or services you have requested from us or through our Services;</li>
			<li>To provide personal information, when required by law, in connection with security-related or law enforcement investigations, to comply with legal requirements, orders, or proceedings, to perform credit checks, report or collect debts owed, or to protect the rights or property of Travelzoo, our employees, our members, and our Services;</li>
			<li>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Travelzoo's <a href="http://www.travelzoo.com/disclaimer/">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>, or as otherwise required by law;</li>
			<li>To customize the content and provide targeted advertising for our Services and to improve our Services;</li>
			<li>To contact you with offers by Travelzoo and/or third parties that we think may be of interest to you;</li>
			<li>To conduct research and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients;</li>
			<li>We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our websites and to estimate the total number of Internet users who visit our websites from certain countries or regions of the world;</li>
			<li>If you are making a purchase on the Site, we often work with third parties and trusted business partners to securely collect your credit card, billing address and other verifying information. The third parties that we have partnered with are required by contract to follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information they receive and/or process on our behalf. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and thus we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We assume no liability for disclosure of personal information due to, among other things, errors in transmission or unauthorized third parties;</li>
			<li>If you make a hotel booking through our website or our mobile platform, we will share your personal information with the hotel and other necessary third parties to provide you with services. Please refer to the website of the hotel you are booking for its privacy policy. Additionally, we may partner with other companies to provide hotel inventory as part of our hotel booking service. A partner consists of a third party company with which we have contracted in order to provide you with our Services featured on our publications or hotel booking platform. Should we partner with a company to provide you a hotel booking, we may share your personal information with that third party partner. Please refer to the website of the partner displayed on our website for its privacy policy;</li>
			<li>We may provide data to trusted partners who work on our behalf to communicate with you about offers from Travelzoo and our marketing partners, or to provide you with our location based services. Note, these companies do not have any right to use or share the data for any other purposes;</li>
			<li>We may also provide data about your mobile device to our third party analytics partners for the purposes of tracking mobile app usage information. We will share your personal information only as necessary for the third party to provide that service;</li>
			<li>We may transfer, share, or disclose your personal information to third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process such as a merger, acquisition, and/or a sale of all, substantially all, or part of our assets, and/or a licensing agreement with third parties.

			<li>We may contract with third parties to analyze our customer data and/or handle web chat, email, customer services and other services. The companies we employ to help us with these tasks have access to personal data to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes;</li>
