<p>
<strong>What are the changes?</strong></p>

<li>Coles Myer Ltd (and its group companies) and the National Australia Bank Limited (and its group

and other related purposes (including to send you direct marketing information).</li>
<li>If you nominate an additional cardholder or provide personal information to FlyBuys about
another person (for example, a family member), you will have to make sure that the person has: 
<ul>
<li>read and understood the FlyBuys Policy on Information Privacy; and</li>
<li>agreed to their personal information being collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the
FlyBuys Policy on Information Privacy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unless you instruct us otherwise, we will be able to use your electronic addresses (including

regarding use of the FlyBuys website and suggest what to do if you are concerned about cookies

<p>
<strong>What do I need to do if there are any additional cardholders?</strong></p>

notice and make sure that they understand the notice and that they can tell us not to disclose
their name to Coles Myer Ltd. (and its group companies) or National Australia Bank Limited (and its

<strong>3.2</strong> FlyBuys will not use or disclose or permit the use or disclosure of personal
information that could be used to identify an individual member in any circumstances except:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>to ensure the proper functioning of the FlyBuys program in relation to the member in question
(for example, to confirm membership and acceptance of the Terms and Conditions, to communicate
points earned, to seek the member's views on the operation of the FlyBuys program in order to
improve member service, to ensure the integrity of points processing by participating retailers, to

and for these purposes personal information will only be disclosed to FlyBuys or a service provider

<ol type="i">
<li>the personal information does not include the name of the member; and</li>
<li>the participating retailer is bound by a confidentiality agreement with FlyBuys under which the
personal information may not be used for mailing purposes or in any other way to make contact with
the member;</li>
</ol></li>
<li>when FlyBuys is required or authorised by law to disclose the personal information;</li>
<li>for fraud and crime prevention and investigation; or</li>
<li>when the member specifically consents in writing to the use or disclosure.
<br> 
<p>Examples of the service providers referred to in paragraph 3.2(a) are data processing and data
analysis agents, printing contractors and the FlyBuys Customer Service Centre. Information will
only be provided to these agents to the extent necessary to enable them to undertake their
contracted roles in the operation of the FlyBuys program.</p></li>
</ol>
<strong>3.3</strong> Coles Group Entities and NAB Group Entities may collect the member's name and
other personal information from FlyBuys for marketing, planning, product development, research,

purposes. To perform these activities Coles Group Entities and NAB Group Entities may share your
personal information with:
<br>
<br> 
<ul>
<li>if the entity is a Coles Group Entity, other Coles Group Entities and if the entity is a NAB Group
Entity, other NAB Group Entities;</li>
<li>service providers such as data processing and data analysis agents, printing contractors,
