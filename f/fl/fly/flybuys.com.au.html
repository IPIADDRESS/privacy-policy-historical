<h2>How we respect your privacy.</h2>
<p>
<strong>Introduction</strong></p>

their personal information by writing to FlyBuys at the address indicated below.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Members' Rights</strong>
<br>
<br>Loyalty Pacific Pty Ltd as manager of the FlyBuys program respects and upholds the rights of
members to privacy protection. The provisions of this Policy are evidence of Loyalty Pacific Pty
Ltd's commitment to that protection. This Policy applies to all personal information held in the
FlyBuys database. Refer section 5 of the FlyBuys Terms and Conditions. Words and phrases defined in
the FlyBuys Terms and Conditions have the same meaning when used in this Policy. In this Policy
"Coles Group Entities" means Coles Group Ltd. (ABN 11 004 089 936) and its related bodies corporate
and "NAB Group Entities" means National Australia Bank Limited ABN 12 004 044 937 and its related
bodies corporate including MLC Ltd.
<br><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 80%;"><a href="#top">top</a></p></li><br>
<li>
<strong>Information - Collection</strong>
<br>
<br> 
<strong>2.1</strong> FlyBuys will, at all times, collect personal information in a fair and lawful
manner.
<br>
<br> 
<strong>2.2</strong> The FlyBuys database may comprise any of the following personal information,
held by FlyBuys: 
<ul>
<li>name, address(es) &amp; telephone number(s)</li>
<li>electronic addresses</li>
<li>gender</li>
<li>date of birth</li>
<li>employment status</li>
<li>information about credit cards linked to FlyBuys</li>
<li>transaction details associated with the earning of FlyBuys points</li>
<li>points earned and awards provided</li>
<li>names, genders and dates of birth of additional cardholders</li>
<li>ages of other family members.</li>
</ul>
<p>Members' signatures/authorities are also collected by FlyBuys.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.3</strong> If you are a FlyBuys member or simply inquiring about our online services such
as Awards Redemption, we may use your electronic addresses (such as your e-mail address or mobile
phone number for receiving SMS) to advise you of any upgrades or changes to these services.</p>
<p>We may also use your electronic addresses to send you from time to time various FlyBuys program
and marketing communications.</p>
<p>If we send you an electronic message for a commercial purpose, we will give you the option of
not receiving further communications of this nature.</p>
<br><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 80%;"><a href="#top">top</a></p></li><br>
<li>
<strong>Information - Purpose and Usage</strong> 
<p>
<br> 
<strong>3.1</strong> Personal information including your electronic addresses will be used for two
primary purposes. First, it will be used to ensure the proper functioning of the FlyBuys program.
Secondly, and subject to the restrictions set out in paragraph 3.3, it will be used by FlyBuys and
the participating retailers for marketing, planning, product development, research, FlyBuys account
administration and fraud and crime prevention and investigation.
<br>
<br> 
<strong>3.2</strong> FlyBuys will not use or disclose or permit the use or disclosure of personal
information that could be used to identify an individual member in any circumstances except:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>to ensure the proper functioning of the FlyBuys program in relation to the member in question
(for example, to confirm membership and acceptance of the Terms and Conditions, to communicate
points earned, to seek the member's views on the operation of the FlyBuys program in order to
improve member service, to ensure the integrity of points processing by participating retailers, to
communicate promotional offers and special events and to identify the member when awards are made)
and for these purposes personal information will only be disclosed to FlyBuys or a service provider
retained by FlyBuys under conditions of confidentiality;</li>
<li>where the personal information is to be used by Coles Group Entities or NAB Group Entities for
the purposes described in clause 3.3;</li>
<li>otherwise, where the personal information is to be used by a participating retailer for
marketing, planning, product development and research and where 
<ol type="i">
<li>the personal information does not include the name of the member; and</li>
<li>the participating retailer is bound by a confidentiality agreement with FlyBuys under which the
personal information may not be used for mailing purposes or in any other way to make contact with
the member;</li>
</ol></li>
<li>when FlyBuys is required or authorised by law to disclose the personal information;</li>
<li>for fraud and crime prevention and investigation; or</li>
<li>when the member specifically consents in writing to the use or disclosure.
<br> 
<p>Examples of the service providers referred to in paragraph 3.2(a) are data processing and data
analysis agents, printing contractors and the FlyBuys Customer Service Centre. Information will
only be provided to these agents to the extent necessary to enable them to undertake their
contracted roles in the operation of the FlyBuys program.</p></li>
</ol>
<strong>3.3</strong> Coles Group Entities and NAB Group Entities may collect the member's name and
other personal information from FlyBuys for marketing, planning, product development, research,
FlyBuys account reconciliation, fraud and crime prevention and investigation and other related
purposes. To perform these activities Coles Group Entities and NAB Group Entities may share your
personal information with:
<br>
<br> 
<ul>
<li>if the entity is a Coles Group Entity, other Coles Group Entities and if the entity is a NAB Group
Entity, other NAB Group Entities;</li>
<li>service providers such as data processing and data analysis agents, printing contractors,
customer service organisations, call centres, professional advisers, auditors, delivery companies
and mailing organisations; and</li>
<li>other organisations as required or authorised by law, for example, to government or
regulatory bodies for the prevention or detection of unlawful activities.
<br>
<br></li>
</ul>
<strong>3.4</strong> FlyBuys undertakes to give proper and responsible consideration to privacy
issues associated with the introduction of new marketing devices or technology.
<br>
<br> 
<strong>3.5</strong> On termination of membership, the member's contact details will be noted as
closed, and after twelve months of non-card usage such contact details will be deleted from the
FlyBuys database and the member's point balance cancelled. 
<br><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 80%;"><a href="#top">top</a></p></li><br>
<li>

<h3 style="color: red;">Important notice</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;
<br />Changes to the FlyBuys Policy on Information Privacy</h3>
<p>FlyBuys has changed the FlyBuys Policy on Information Privacy. This notice describes changes
that have been made. These changes came into effect on 1 January 2006. You can call us on 13 1116,
if you would like a full copy of the amended FlyBuys Policy on Information Privacy.</p>
<p>
<strong>What are the changes?</strong></p>
<p>There are four key changes to the FlyBuys Policy on Information Privacy.
<br />In summary, from 1 January 2006:</p>
<ol>
<li>FlyBuys will be allowed to disclose your personal information (including your name) to Coles
Myer Ltd. (and its group companies) and the National Australia Bank Limited (and its group
companies), as owners of the FlyBuys program.</li>
<li>Coles Myer Ltd (and its group companies) and the National Australia Bank Limited (and its group
companies) will be allowed to collect your name and other personal information from FlyBuys. They
may use and disclose that personal information within their corporate groups (and to their service
providers) for marketing, planning, product development, research, FlyBuys account reconciliation
and other related purposes (including to send you direct marketing information).</li>
<li>If you nominate an additional cardholder or provide personal information to FlyBuys about
another person (for example, a family member), you will have to make sure that the person has: 
<ul>
<li>read and understood the FlyBuys Policy on Information Privacy; and</li>
<li>agreed to their personal information being collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the
FlyBuys Policy on Information Privacy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unless you instruct us otherwise, we will be able to use your electronic addresses (including
your e-mail address and mobile phone number for receiving SMS), to the extent that you have
provided them, to let you know about upgrades to our online services (such as Award Redemption) and
to send you FlyBuys program and marketing communications.</li>
</ol>
<p>The FlyBuys Policy on Information Privacy has also been updated to mention some privacy issues
regarding use of the FlyBuys website and suggest what to do if you are concerned about cookies
being placed on your computer when you use the FlyBuys website.</p>
<p>There are also some other minor changes being made. These include changes to:</p>
<ul>
<li>update the list of types of personal information that may be held on the FlyBuys database;</li>
<li>include some definitions of words used in the FlyBuys Policy on Information Privacy; and</li>
<li>give you details on how to unsubscribe from the FlyBuys email database if you do not want to
receive e-mails from FlyBuys.</li>
</ul>
<br /><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 80%;"><a href="#top">top</a></p><br />
<p>
<strong>What do I need to do?</strong></p>
<p>If you are happy with these changes you do not need to do anything. The changes will come into
effect automatically.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to be bound by these changes, you can withdraw from FlyBuys. You can do this
by writing to us at: Loyalty Pacific Pty Ltd, PO Box 12125, A' Beckett Street, Melbourne, VIC
8006.</p>
<p>You can, at any time, tell us not to disclose your name to Coles Myer Ltd (and its group
companies) or National Australia Bank Limited (and its group companies). You can do this by writing
to us or by calling us on&nbsp;13 1116.</p>
<br /><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 80%;"><a href="#top">top</a></p><br />
<p>
<strong>What do I need to do if there are any additional cardholders?</strong></p>
<p>If you have previously nominated an additional cardholder or provided personal information to
FlyBuys about a family member or any other person, you should give that person a copy of this
notice and make sure that they understand the notice and that they can tell us not to disclose
their name to Coles Myer Ltd. (and its group companies) or National Australia Bank Limited (and its
group companies) by calling the FlyBuys Service Centre on 13 1116. If that person is under 18 years
of age, please make sure that a parent or guardian reads this notice on their behalf.</p>
