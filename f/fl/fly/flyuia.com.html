<strong>4. Cookies, web beacons and pixel tags and how they can benefit your website
experience?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Cookies are very small text files stored on your
hard drive. They uniquely identify your computer and allow us to store profile
information, improve website security and help us to customise your website
experience. A unique user identity is created which ensures that you are not
required to re-enter login details as you move throughout the website. Time
spent navigating the site is kept to a minimum. As is described in more detail

We contract with online partners to help manage

disclose or share this information with any third parties. If you do not wish
