<strong>4. Cookies, web beacons and pixel tags and how they can benefit your website
experience?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Cookies are very small text files stored on your
hard drive. They uniquely identify your computer and allow us to store profile
information, improve website security and help us to customise your website
experience. A unique user identity is created which ensures that you are not
required to re-enter login details as you move throughout the website. Time
spent navigating the site is kept to a minimum. As is described in more detail
below, they may also be used to assist us in making our website and our emails
work more efficiently as well as to provide us with business and marketing
information. For more detailed information on cookies, visit
www.allaboutcookies.org.

<p>
<strong>(a) Technology used during your web visit</strong>
</p>
<p>
We contract with online partners to help manage
and optimize our internet business and communications and to help us measure the
effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we
use cookies provided by our online partners on this site. By supplementing our
records, this information helps us learn things such as what pages are most
attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers,
and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our online partner
logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that
data may and may not be used.
</p>
<p>
If you do not want to help us learn how to
improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can
"opt-out" of this website analysis tool. How you do this will depend
upon the internet browser you use (for example, Internet Explorer 5, Netscape 4
or Opera etc). Please refer to the relevant internet browser manufacturer's
website where you should be able to receive all the information required.
</p>
<p>
<strong>(b) Technology used in our e-mails</strong>
</p>
<p>
In addition, we may use e-mail delivery and
marketing companies to send e-mails that you have consented to receive. Pixel

measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our website.

</p>
<p>

as a result of clicking on a link, we are able to understand how you interact
with the pages of our website through the combination of the cookie and pixels
set on the pages of our website. This enables us to understand what interested
you in our emails and what did not, and what interests you about our website and
what does not. We can then try to send you more interesting information in the
future. Please note that this information is for our use only - we do not
disclose or share this information with any third parties. If you do not wish
this to happen, you can change the cookie settings in your browser.
