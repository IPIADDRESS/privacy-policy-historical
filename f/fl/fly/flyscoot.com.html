We require those vendors to keep your PD confidential and not to use it for their own purposes. You expressly consent to the sharing of your PD with our third-party service providers and vendors.</p>
							<p><strong><i>Compliance with Laws and Protection of Rights</i></strong></p>
							<p>Regardless of any choices you make regarding Your PD, we may disclose your PD if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with laws or regulations, court orders, subpoenas, or other legal process; or (b) protect and defend Our rights or property, or the rights or safety of third parties, or to enforce our Terms of Use or this Privacy Notice.</p>
							<p><strong><i>Purpose of Collection or Use of PD</i></strong></p>
                            <p>If We use or disclose Your PD for a purpose (the 'secondary purpose') other the main reason for which it was originally collected (the 'primary purpose'), to the extent required by law We will ensure that:
                                </p><ul>
                                    <li>The secondary purpose is related to the primary purpose of collection and You would reasonably expect that We would use or disclose Your PD in that way; or</li>
                                    <li>You have consented to the use or disclosure of Your PD for the secondary purpose; or</li>

                                </ul>
                               If We are made aware that We received unsolicited PD that We could not have collected in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable legislation, such PD will be destroyed or de-identified as soon as practicable, as permitted by applicable law.
                            <p></p>

</p>
							<h4 class="title">Security</h4>
							<p>We implement technical, administrative, and organizational safeguards to prevent access to your PD by unauthorized persons.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as totally secure.

If You are included in a booking with Us for travel with other persons, You agree that We may share some of Your PD with the other people in connection with Your booking.</p>
						<h4 class="title">Booking of Ancillary Services and Links to Third-Party Sites</h4>
							<p>Our Website may provide a link to another website or Internet location, including third-party sites with Scoot-branded pages (“Third-Party Sites”).  For example, when You make a booking for a related travel product, such as a hotel or a rental car, via the Website, We act only as a data intermediary for the organisation that is selling You the product.  We provide these links merely for your convenience, and we have no control over, do not review, and are not responsible for these Third-Party Sites, their content, or any goods or services available through the Third-Party Sites. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to these Third-Party Sites.  <br>
As a data intermediary, We may collect PD from You when you interact with the Third-Party Sites. This PD will be processed in accordance with this Privacy Notice and in the same manner as if We were collecting it from You for Our purposes.
</p>

							<p>If You do not wish to remain a subscriber to Our mailing list or otherwise receive updates on Our products and services, You are able to unsubscribe from Our mailing list via Our website, by clicking on the ‘Unsubscribe’ link on an email from Us or by contacting the Data Protection Officer.

						</p><ul><li>An investigating authority or government institution objects to Scoot complying with a customer’s request,</li>
<li>The information may, in the exercise of Scoot’s reasonable discretion and/or assessment, affect the life or security of an individual, and</li>

							<h4 class="small-title">Information that is not Personal Data</h4>
							<p>In addition, Scoot also collects behavioural data that is not Personal Data from Our customers when You visit the website. Behavioural data is stored for analytical purposes and is entirely anonymous.</p>
							
							<h5 class="small-title"><i>Technologies Used</i></h5>
							<p>Third parties, widgets, and hosted solutions that we use on our website may use the following technologies for features, services, advertising, or analytics.  These technologies can include:</p>
							
							<h5 class="small-title"><i>Site Visit Information</i></h5>
							<p>When You visit Our website, information about Your visit may include Your server address, the date and time of Your visit, the pages You accessed, the information You downloaded and the type of Internet browser You used.</p>
<p>We or Our contractors may use this information in anonymous, aggregated form, for statistical or analytical purposes, to assist Us in improving the quality and usability of Our Website and the Services.
</p>
							<h5 class="small-title"><i>Cookies</i></h5>
							<p>A cookie is a small string of information that a website transfers to Your browser to distinguish your device from others by having the cookie consist of a unique identifier or other data.
<br>
Cookies can either be "persistent" or "session" based. Persistent cookies are stored on Your computer and stay on your computer until you delete them. Session cookies are short-lived and are held on Your browser's memory only for the duration of Your session. Browser Cookies are used only during a browsing session and expire when You quit Your browser. We or Our contractors may use both session and persistent cookies. This information may be used to personalise Your current visit to Our and Our contractors' websites. Upon closing Your browser, the session cookie is destroyed.  Persistent cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions.
<br>
Most Internet browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies. If You do not want to accept cookies, You can adjust Your Internet browser to reject cookies or to notify You when they are being used. Rejecting cookies may limit the functionality of Our Website.
</p><h5 class="small-title"><i>Local Shared Objects</i></h5>
<p>Local shared objects (such as "Flash" cookies) are associated with non-Browser software like Flash Player.  Local shared objects can be used like cookies to distinguish your device from others, but will not be deleted or blocked using browser cookie controls.  You can visit adobe.com for guidance on how to delete and block Flash cookies.</p>
<p></p><h5 class="small-title"><i>HTML5 Local Storage </i></h5>
<p>HTML5 local storage is another way that browsers can distinguish your device from others as well as remember data that may be important for the functioning of the website. Typically HTML5 local storage is only deleted if all Internet history, cache, and cookies are deleted.  You should check your browser software for how to delete HTML5 local storage in your particular case. </p>
<h5 class="small-title"><i>Web Beacons</i></h5>
<p>Web beacons are image files that are used by third-party advertisers, analytics companies, and others.  Web beacons are embedded in web pages you visit and cause your browser to share its IP address with the third-party source of the beacon, together with any cookies associated with that third-party.  Web beacons can be used with or without cookies.  Blocking cookies will not stop your IP address from being shared through the use of beacons.</p>
<h5 class="small-title"><i>E-tags</i></h5>
<p>E-tags are used to prevent duplicative downloading of content to your browser, which can enhance browser performance.  E-tags use unique identifiers for content that can also be used to distinguish your browser in certain instances from others.  Typically e-tags are only deleted if all Internet history, cache, and cookies are deleted.  You should check your browser software for how to delete e-tags in your particular case.
</p>
<h5 class="small-title"><i>Other Technologies</i></h5>
<p>Our Website may occasionally use other technologies both for purposes of advertising as well as for features, analytics and services.</p>
							<h4 class="title">Advertising and Partnership with Adara and Sojern</h4>
							<p>We use "interest-based" advertisements also known as "online behavioral advertising." Online behavioral advertising is advertising that is directed to you based, at least in part, on your Internet browsing behavior across websites and over time.  For example, Scoot partners advertising networks, Adara (Adara.com) and Sojern (Sojern.com), to capture non-personally identifiable data from You through third-party cookies. This enables Adara and Sojern to display targeted and relevant messages from selected third-party websites, based on Your viewing behaviour on the Scoot websites and other selected websites. Your non-personally identifiable data is shared by Scoot with Adara and Sojern for the unique purpose of serving more relevant advertising. These third parties and their affiliates do collect certain information as a result of their javascript "tags" and other technologies being used on our website. The information that they collect includes the names of web pages you view (URL's), unique identifiers, your IP address, timestamp, and certain types of technical information. We have no control over the use of cookies by Adara and Sojern. You can opt-out of cookie use as follows:</p>
							<h5 class="small-title"><i>For Adara</i></h5>
							<p>
							</p><ul>
								<li>By visiting <a class="external-link" href="http://adara.com/privacy-promise/opt-out" target="_blank">http://adara.com/privacy-promise/opt-out</a> and clicking ‘Submit’; or</li>
								<li>Through the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioural Advertising, of which Adara is member. Each of these programmes provides an opt-out page where You can exercise control over members/’participants’ cookies from a central location.</li>
							</ul><p></p>
							<h5 class="small-title"><i>For Sojern</i></h5>
							<p>
							</p><ul>
								<li>By visiting <a class="external-link" href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?affiliateId=111" target="_blank">http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?affiliateId=111</a>, checking the opt-out box and clicking ‘Submit Opt-outs’; or</li>
								<li>Through the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioural Advertising, of which Sojern is a member. This programme provides an opt-out page where You can exercise control over members/’participants’ cookies from a central location.</li></ul>
								
								<h5 class="small-title"><i>For Other Third Parties</i></h5>
								<li>To opt-out of NAI members’ or DAA participants’ cookies, visit:</li>
								<ul><li>NAI: <a class="external-link" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a></li>
								<li>DAA: <a class="external-link" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a></li></ul>
							<p></p>
							<p>As an alternative to the DAA opt–out, you can also elect to block browser cookies from first parties (such as those from our website) and browser cookies from third parties (such as advertisers) by using the cookie blocking options built into your browser software.  If you block browser cookies, some parts of our website may not function correctly. Also, blocking cookies will not stop third-parties from collecting IP address, data stored in "Flash" cookies, and certain other types of technical information that may uniquely identify your browser.</p>
							<h5 class="small-title"><i>Third Parties May Collect Personal Information from Other Sources</i></h5>
							<p>Some third parties involved in advertising operations may maintain their own proprietary consumer databases that allow them to personally identify or track website visitors. Other third parties have proprietary technologies to determine what additional devices you may use, on which it can display relevant advertisements.</p>
							<h5 class="small-title"><i>Do Not Track</i></h5>
							<p>Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative that has developed a “flag” or signal that an Internet user may activate in the user’s browser software to notify websites that the user does not wish to be “tracked” by third-parties as defined by the initiative. The online community has not agreed on what actions, if any, should be taken by the websites that receive the “do not track” signal, and therefore Do-Not-Track is not yet standardized. Our website does not alter its behavior or change its services when it receives a “do-not-track” flag or signal from your browser.</p>
							<h5 class="small-title"><i>Social Network Widget</i></h5>
							<p>Our website may include social network sharing widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third-parties about your interactions with our web pages that you visit, even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget. Information is transmitted from your browser and may include an identifier assigned by the social network or third party, information about your browser type, operating system, device type, IP address, and the URL of the web page where widget appears. If you use social network tools or visit social networking sites, you should read their privacy disclosures, to learn what information they collect, use, and share.</p>
							<h3 class="title">Information from Children Under 13</h3>
							<p>On our website, we do not intentionally gather Personal Information from visitors under the age of 13.  If you believe we have inadvertently collected information about your child, please contact our Data Protection Officer, and we will attempt to delete the information.
