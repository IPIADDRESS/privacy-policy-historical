<h2 id="h2-Privacy-Policy"><span>Privacy Policy</span></h2><p>We at FLYCELL/Acotel USA, Inc. know how much you value your privacy, so we make sure that your privacy is protected any time you're using our services. You do need to give us some personal information so we're able to process your orders and requests. However, we want you to know what information we need, why we need it, and how we make sure that your information is protected. We want you to be able to enjoy your FLYCELL experience safely and privately.</p>
<h3><span>Your FLYCELL account</span></h3>
<p>When you sign up with FLYCELL, you establish a password-protected personal account for ordering ringtones, graphics, games and other items and services. </p>
<h3><span>Information we need from you</span></h3>
<p>In order to establish your private FLYCELL account and/or place an order, we need some personal information from you. This information may include contact information (such as name, email, cell phone number and
address) and certain billing information (such as credit card number and expiration date.) </p>
<p>We may occasionally request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and mailing address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the FLYCELL service.</p>
<h3><span>Changing your information</span></h3>
<p>To update your personal information, simply sign in and go to <em>My Account</em> from your personal home page. You may also contact our Support team by
writing <a href="mailto:flycellsupport@acotel.com">flycellsupport@acotel.com</a>
.
You can make changes to your account information at any time.</p>
<h3><span>Protecting your information</span></h3>
<p>FLYCELL uses industry best practices to protect your information and your privacy. When your password or credit card number are requested on the site, we use SSL to present secure pages to protect that information.</p>
<p>You can tell if you are using a secure server by looking at the bottom of your browser window. In Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you will see a lock icon. When the symbol is unbroken or the padlock appears to be in its closed state, the page is encrypted and therefore secure. If you wish to take advantage of the latest encryption standards, be sure you have the latest version of the browser you're using. You can download the latest version from the Netscape or Microsoft Web sites. Beta versions of browsers are not recommended.</p>
<h3><span>E-mail notification of new FLYCELL features and special offers</span></h3>
<p>We will notify you about new features and services on FLYCELL ONLY if you request to receive this information when you register as a new user. You may subscribe or unsubscribe to this notification service through your account profile on the Acotel website.</p>
<p>We may send you site and service announcement updates with important information about the service. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements.</p>
<h3><span>Sharing your information with third parties</span></h3>
<p>The personal information that you provide is an important part of our business. We are not in the business of selling this information to others. This information will only be shared with our direct partners and agents as required.</p>
<h3><span>Cookies</span></h3>
<p>Cookies are pieces of information that your browser receives from Web sites and stores on your computer's hard drive. Information in cookies includes preferences you select while visiting a particular Web site. For example, by storing cookies on your hard drive, you'll return to a specific Web site with the same settings you used on a previous visit.</p>
<p>FLYCELL never saves information such as your password or your credit card number on cookies. We do require cookies in order to manage and protect your FLYCELL session, and if you choose, to store your e-mail address (so you don't have to type it in every time you log in). 
If you have cookies turned off, you will not be able to access the FLYCELL service.</p>
<h3><span>Log files</span></h3>
<p>Our servers store IP addresses for all connections to the service. 
This data is analyzed in the aggregate and is not linked to your personal account.</p>
<h3><span>Third Party Advertising</span></h3>
<p>Ads that appear on this Site may be delivered to users by a number of advertising partners that may change from time to time. 
Information about users' visits to this Site, such as the number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, or other personally identifiable information), may be used to serve ads to users on this Site.</p>
<h3><span>Legal exceptions to the rules</span></h3>
<p>Only in the case of our good-faith belief that the law requires it or, to protect your or our rights or property, will we disclose customer information to proper law enforcement authorities even though you might have sent us an e-mail requesting that we don't share your information. This information may be necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone who may attempt to cause injury to another's rights or property.</p>
<h3><span>Notification of changes</span></h3>
<p>If our privacy policy changes, those changes will be posted to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are aware of the policy and applicable changes. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will e-mail our users announcing the new privacy policy.</p>
<h3><span>Your Acceptance of this Policy</span></h3>
<p>By visiting our Site, you signify your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Minors can only use our Site with the consent and involvement of their parent or guardian. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this Privacy Policy at any time. Please check our Site for updates. Any dispute as to these terms shall be governed by Massachusetts law and subject to the courts of Massachusetts.</p>
<h3><span>Ownership</span></h3>
<p>Acotel USA, Inc. owns and operates FLYCELL and is the sole owner of the information collected on our Site.</p>
<h3><span>Contact Information</span></h3>
