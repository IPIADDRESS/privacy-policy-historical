                Collected From This Website</strong></font><font color="#333333" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
                When you visit this website, some information, such as the site 
                that referred you to us, your IP and email address, and navigational 
                and purchase information, may be collected automatically as part 
                of the site's operation. This information is used to generate 
                user profiles and to personalise the website to your particular 
                interests. On some occasions we may ask you to provide information 
                on online forms. For example, we may ask for your username, password, 
                place of birth, full name, telephone number, email address and 
                postal address, or other information to register online, or for 
                your credit card number or other personally identifying information 
                to fulfill licensing transactions or to receive products or services. 
                We may also ask you about your age, hobbies, income, gender or 
                other information to participate in surveys or other online activities. 
                Providing information on online forms is always voluntary, and 
                you are free not to complete any online forms. If you choose not 
                to, however, some products and services may not be available to 
                you. </font></p>

                We Use Your Information</strong></font><font color="#333333" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
                The information collected online is stored indefinitely and is 
                used for various purposes, including processing your transactions, 
                customer service, product and service development, direct marketing 
                and marketing analysis, facilitating your use of this website, 
                and customizing your image selection to your particular interests. 
                The information we collect may be shared with our subsidiaries, 
                agents, third party content providers, affiliates, and selected 
                other entities for similar purposes. For example, when you fill 
                out an online registration form on a FlyerStarter.com website you 
                are automatically registered on a number of FlyerStarter.com visual 
                content provider websites. That is, your user name and password 
                are carried across these sites, allowing you to use the same name 
                and password to sign in (although you will still be required to 
                enter billing information to make purchases on those sites). </font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                addition, unless you opt out of receiving promotional materials 
                from FlyerStarter.com, we may notify you of special promotions, new 
                products or services, or other information that may be of interest.

                When you visit a FlyerStarter.com website, such as FlyerStarter.com, 
                we place a text file called a cookie in the browser directory 
                of your computer's hard drive. A cookie is a small piece of information 
                that a website can store on your web browser and later retrieve. 
                The information that cookies collect includes the date and time 
                of your visit, your registration information and your navigational 
                and purchase activity. Cookies offer you many conveniences. They 
                allow FlyerStarter.com, and certain of its subsidiaries and third 
                party content providers, to recognize information, such as the 
                Lightboxes you have created, and assist in determining what content 
                is best suited to your needs. Cookies also allow you to retrieve 
                previous image search results, access Lightboxes with ease and 
                view your previous invoices. </font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most 
                browsers allow you to decline cookies, but if you elect to do 
                so, these pages may not display properly. You are free to delete 
                cookies after your session, and your browser should contain instructions

                If you do not want to receive promotional information from FlyerStarter.com, you can opt out by un-checking the appropriate box on 
                your online registration form, or in the event an online registration 
                form is not available, by notifying your account executive. If 
                you did not opt out when you registered, and later decide that 
                you are not interested in receiving this information, you can 
                opt out at any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:sales@FlyerStarter.com">sales@FlyerStarter.com</a> 
                or speaking with your account executive. Please note that if you
