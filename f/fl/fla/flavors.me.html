</p><ul>
This policy (together with our terms of use <a href="http://flavors.me/terms">Terms of Use</a> and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.
<br><br> For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”), the data controller is Moo Print Limited (registered in England and Wales with company number: 05121723) of 32-38 Scrutton Street London EC2A 4RQ Information we may collect from you
<br><br>You can browse our website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you create an account, which only requires that you provide us a login name, email address and password, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to provide us with this or any other personal information, you consent to the processing, storage and transfer of that information.
<br><br> We collect, use and share personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information only as described in this privacy policy. By providing us with your information and registering on the website, you agree to the collection of such information.
<li class="headed-list">We may collect and process the following data about you:</li>
<ul>
<br><li>Payment Information. If you decide to upgrade we will either collect payment information or link you to a website where you can make payment;</li>
<br><li>Login information. We recommend that you use a username as your login name in order to protect your own privacy. If you use your name as a login, or otherwise provide your name or other information in your community profile or bio, the information will become available to us and the community and may be used to contact you;</li>
<br><li>Log files. When you use our website, our servers automatically record certain information sent by your web browser. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on our website, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, mobile carrier, and other such information;</li>
<br><li>Clear gifs information. When you use our website, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons), which are used to track the online usage patterns. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting and make our website better for members of our community.</li>
<br><li>Information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location. When you use our website by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse our website. Though location data does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you, it may be used in conjunction with personally identifiable information from other sources. Some features of our website, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.</li>
<br><li>Device identifiers. When you access our website by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device and are used to enhance our website. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent by us to the device. A device identifier may convey to us information about how you use our website. Though a device identifier does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you, it may be used in conjunction with personally identifiable information obtained from other sources. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through our website. Some features of our website may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers are impaired or disabled. Our website may access, collect and/or store device identifiers.</li>
<br><li>Third party tools. We use third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to help understand the use of our website. Many of these tools collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address. These analytics tools also receive this information and their use of it is governed by their privacy policy.</li>
<br><li>Information that you provide by filling in forms when using or registering to use our website, subscribing to our services, posting material or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with the website;</li>
<br><li>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence;</li>
<br><li>We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them; and</li>

We also collect non-personally identifying information related to your use of our website. When you use our website, we may send one or more “cookies” – a small data file – to your computer to uniquely identify your browser and let us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may convey to us anonymous information about how you browse our website, and we may use such information to address targeted advertising such as banner ads or other communications to you. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser so that your browser can use it on subsequent visits to our website. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
