  <h1>ANTI-SPAM/Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h2>Personal Information</h2>
  <p>In order to receive any of Flavorpill Productions’ publications, including Flavorpill (in all cities), Activate, Artkrush, Boldtype, Earplug, our Network Update, Design Update, or any of our publications, we need your email address. Flavorpill Productions will not disclose your email or any personal information to any third party without your consent.</p>
  <h2>ANTI-SPAM</h2>
  <p>Flavorpill Productions does not buy, rent, or sell email addresses to or from third parties. Every email publication sent includes links to unsubscribe, allowing users to automatically and immediately remove themselves from subscription lists. The only way to receive Flavorpill or any of our publications is to subscribe to it.</p>
  <p>Flavorpill Productions complies with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.</p>
  <h2>Unsubscribe</h2>
  <p>Users may always opt out of receiving any Flavorpill Productions publication by going directly to its manage subscriptions page. Flavorpill Productions manages e-mail lists through its list management system. Unsubscribing from one list managed by Flavorpill Productions will not remove the user from all publication email lists. Users with questions or experiencing problems unsubscribing should email <a href="mailto:subscriptions@flavorpill.com">subscriptions@flavorpill.com</a></p>
  <h2>Contests and Giveaways</h2>
  <p>Flavorpill Productions regularly requests information from users via contests and giveaways. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and email) and creative answers to impress contest judges. Flavorpill Productions reserves the right to publish all information submitted for the contests and giveaways on its Feedback (or Forum) sections.</p>
  <h2>Send Events</h2>
  <p>Whenever readers use the "send event" function to forward emails to others, the recipients are NOT added to any subscription list.</p>
  <h2>Log Files</h2>
  <p>Flavorpill Productions uses IP addresses and email addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>Flavorpill Productions shares only aggregated demographic profiles with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</p>
  <h2>Links</h2>
  <p>Both the Flavorpill Productions mailers and websites contain links to other sites. Flavorpill Productions is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites that are not within its network of sites. </p>
  <h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
  <p>Flavorpill Productions reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise alter these terms and conditions at any time. Such changes and/or modifications shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof. Please review the terms and conditions periodically. Continued use of any Flavorpill Productions publication following the posting of changes and/or modifications constitutes acceptance of the revised terms and conditions.</p>
  <h2>Subscriber Lists</h2>

  <p>Flavorpill Productions owns the publications Flavorpill, Artkrush, Boldtype, Earplug, and Activate and all other Flavorpill-branded email newsletters, all of which are governed by this Privacy Policy.  In the event that Flavorpill Productions or any of its assets are purchased by a third party, the Company will request that all data be governed by this Privacy Policy and continue to be governed under these same terms following any sale.  </p>

  <p>Flavorpill Productions also may from time to time consolidate its subscription lists and email products, and under such circumstances, will first notify users of the change and provide the option to opt out.  Flavorpill also sends occasional  “Dedicated” sponsored emails to the subscription lists, promoting a product, service or offer from one of our partners.  In such cases, the emails are created, written, and sent from Flavorpill and the addresses are never shared with our partners.  Subscribers to all Flavorpill publications are automatically added to the “Dedicated” email list.  Flavorpill may also, from time-to-time, send subscribers emails announcing other Flavorpill publications with the option to subscribe.</p>
  <h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>Flavorpill Productions may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us, our partners, sponsors, investors, or affiliates; (b) protect and defend our rights or property or those of our users; and (c) act as immediately necessary in order to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@flavorpill.com">privacy@flavorpill.com</a>.</p>
