<b>FLAGCOUNTER.COM PRIVACY POLICY</b>

<br><font size="-2"><i>Posted May 8, 2008</i></font>
<p>
This document describes our policies regarding privacy, and the privacy expectations that you may have when using viewing or using our flag counters, or when corresponding with us.

<br><br>

<b>CUSTOMER INFORMATION</b></p><p>
Personal information submitted to us by customers of our service (i.e. those who create their own flag counter), such as contact and/or billing information, will ordinarily not be revealed to third-parties, except as we deem in our sole discretion necessary to provide our service; however, we may preserve content and membership information and may release any or all preserved content or membership information to governmental agencies, courts, or other third-parties if we believe, in our sole discretion, that you have or may have committed illegal activities, violated our Terms of Service, violated the rights of third-parties, impaired in any respect the ability of Boardhost.com, Inc. to operate our service properly, or endangered in any respect Boardhost.com, Inc. or third-parties, or in the event that the information is subpoenaed or subject to other judicial or administrative process. 
</p><p>
<b>CORRESPONDENCE WITH US</b>
</p><p>
Any correspondence we receive from third-parties regarding a customer of our service’s account may be revealed to that customer, or to other third-parties at our sole discretion (even if the third-party contacting us is also our customer). For instance, if we receive a complaint regarding a customer's account, we may reveal that complaint to the account holder, so that they may address the situation.
</p><p>
Correspondence received from customers of our service (who identify themselves as such) regarding their account will ordinarily not be revealed to third parties, except as we deem in our sole discretion, necessary for us to address any issues raised in or by such correspondence, or as required by law. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
<b>STATISTICAL INFORMATION COLLECTED</b>
</p><p>
Information related to the viewership of your website (or the viewership of wherever you or anyone else has placed the counter code) will be publicly disclosed, including being displayed on your website, and anywhere else you, or anyone else implements code from our service (with or without your permission). Such viewership information further will be displayed on flagcounter.com or on other websites owned or operated by Boardhost.com, Inc. This information includes, but is not limited to the identified country of origin of your website's visitors and other visitor statistics and information we may collect.
