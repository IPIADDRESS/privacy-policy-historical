					  <h2>Collection and Use of Anonymous Information</h2>
					  <p>Anonymous information  is <em>not</em> personally identifiable  information.&nbsp; Anonymous information is  information that is collected automatically that relates to, but is not limited  to, how certain features of our website are used, what general region our  visitors are contacting us from and how many people visit our website at any  given time.&nbsp; We use this information, and  may share with, license to or sell this information to third parties, for the  purpose of allowing targeted marketing through our website.&nbsp; </p>
					  <h2>Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable  Information</h2>
					  <p>In the course of  selling tickets or other merchandise, we may collect and maintain certain  non-public personal information that will help us to efficiently perform  various transactions.&nbsp; We may be required  to share your personal information with certain entertainment organizations and  venues (an “Event Host”) as part of our contractual relationship with  them.&nbsp; Also, your personal information  may be entered into software systems maintained by third party application  service providers (e.g. our customer service system) for the purpose of  allowing us to conduct our services.&nbsp; To  the extent that your personal information is used in the foregoing manner, we  will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such service providers  do not use your personal information for any purpose other than delivery of our  services.</p>
					  <p>We do not collect  personal information (such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses  or credit card numbers) about you, except when you specifically provide the  information on a voluntary basis.&nbsp; Your  personal information may be collected as you:</p>
					  <ul>
					    <li>Become a  registered user of <strong>flashseats.com; </strong></li>
					    <li>Bid on, or  purchase Right(s) (“Rights” is defined in our <a href="/FsWeb/f/h/termsAndConditions.asp">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>);</li>
					    <li>Sign-up or  subscribe for products or services that we may periodically make available; or</li>
					    <li>Receive Right(s)  transferred to you from one of our account holders. (You will be notified if  your personal information is collected in this manner by receipt of a transfer  email from one of our account holders.)</li>
			    </ul>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p>We use your personally  identifiable information for several purposes:</p>
					  <h3>1. Transactional  Communications</h3>
					    <ul>
					      <li>If you are  bidding for or selling Right(s) the Company utilizes your personal information  to communicate with you regarding the status of your bid or auction. </li>
					      <li>If you have  posted a request to purchase Right(s) (an “ask”), the Company utilizes your  personal information to notify you of responses to your ask.</li>
					      <li>If you are  purchasing Right(s), the Company utilizes your personal information to complete  the purchase transaction and to communicate with you about your ticket order,  to provide you with instructions on how to use and/or access your electronic  ticket to gain admission to an event or venue or other inquiry.</li>
					      <li>Whenever you  purchase Right(s) we may be required to share your personal information with a  third-party credit card processor to facilitate completion of your  transaction.&nbsp; The credit card processor  may share the same information with your credit card issuer in connection with  gathering data related to use of their cards, rewards programs or other purposes.  You are urged to read and become familiar with the privacy policies governing  the use of your credit cards. </li>
					      <li>When you purchase  Right(s), <em>we may be contractually  required to provide your personal information to the Event Host</em> so that  they may communicate with you about the event you are going to attend. Under  those circumstances, we cannot offer you the option to opt-out from having your  information passed to the Event Host.&nbsp;  Event Hosts are not subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy,  which means that they may use your personal information for purposes other than  contacting you about the event you are going to attend, unless you contact them  and request otherwise. <strong><em>You are urged to read and become familiar  with the privacy policies governing events and venues prior to purchasing Right(s).</em></strong></li>
						  <li>Whenever you transfer an account balance to your bank account we may be required to share your personal information with a third-party financial processor to facilitate completion of your transaction.  The processor may share the same information with your bank in connection with the transaction. You are urged to read and become familiar with the privacy policies governing the bank accounts to which you transfer funds using our system.</li>
					      <li>We may  occasionally contact you, typically by email, to notify you of information that  might affect your event experience, or to notify you of event cancellations or  errors in your order.&nbsp; </li>
				        </ul>
						<h3>2. Service/Account  Communications</h3>
					    <ul>
					      <li>We may contact  you regarding the status of your account, your registration information,  support issues regarding our service, and changes to our service or the terms  under which it is offered.</li>
				        </ul>
						
						<h3>3. Informational  Communications</h3>
					    <ul>
					      <li>We may contact  you regarding the availability of Right(s) similar to those you have purchased  in the past, or the current selling prices of Right(s) similar to those you  hold.&nbsp; We may also send you  communications regarding the availability or selling prices of Right(s)  according to preferences you set in your user profile.&nbsp; If you are not interested in receiving  informational communications from us, you can unsubscribe at any time by  altering your email preferences in your user profile or by emailing <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@flashseats.com">unsubscribe@flashseats.com</a> from  the email address used to identify your account with the word “Unsubscribe  Informational” in the subject line.</li>
				        </ul>
						<h3>4. Promotional  Communications</h3>
					    <ul>
					      <li>We may contact  you regarding special promotions related to our service, or to events or  venues.&nbsp; If you are not interested in  receiving promotional communications from us, you can unsubscribe at any time  by altering your email preferences in your user profile or by emailing <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@flashseats.com">unsubscribe@flashseats.com</a> from  the email address used to identify your account with the word “Unsubscribe  Promotional” in the subject line.</li>
				        </ul>
						<h3>5. Marketing  Communications</h3>
					    <ul>
					      <li>We may contact  you regarding offerings of future events, products or services that may be of  interest to you.&nbsp; If you are not  interested in receiving marketing communications or advertisements from us, you  can unsubscribe at any time by altering your email preferences in your user  profile or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@flashseats.com">unsubscribe@flashseats.com</a> from the email  address used to identify your account with the word “Unsubscribe Marketing” in  the subject line.</li>
				        </ul>
					  <p>Additionally, we may  share your personally identifiable information in the following circumstances:</p>
					  <ul>
					    <li>We may disclose  your personally identifiable information when required by law.&nbsp; Specifically, we may disclose this  information to unrelated parties in special cases when we have reason to  believe that our disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal  action against a person or persons who may be causing injury to, or  interference with, the rights or property of the Company (including our  website), computer users accessing our website, or any third party.&nbsp; In addition, we may disclose information about  individuals who access our website to law enforcement agencies, judicial or  government authorities or to other individuals or entities in response to  subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes.</li>
					    <li>In the event that  Flash Seats goes through a business transition, such as a merger, an acquisition  by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of its assets, your and other  users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets  transferred.&nbsp; If as a result of the  business transition, your personal information will be used in a manner  different from that stated at the time of collection, you will be given the  option to continue sharing the information consistent with our notification of  changes section.&nbsp; Nothing in this Privacy  Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Flash Seats to transfer all  or part of its business and/or assets (including the website) for any purposes,  without limitation.&nbsp; Flash Seats  specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of personally  identifiable information collected from this website to the buyer of that  portion of its business relating to that information. </li>
			    </ul>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p>If you are a registered  user of <strong>flashseats.com</strong>, we may  retain your information as long as you maintain your registered status.&nbsp; If you purchase tickets or other merchandise  using a credit card, we will retain your credit card information for a length  of time necessary to process any future transactions related to your purchases,  including refunds and charge backs.</p>
					  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
					  <p>Our sites comply with  the terms of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.&nbsp; Under this Act, no website operator is  permitted to require, as a condition to participation in an activity, that a  child under the age of 13 disclose more information than is reasonably  necessary to participate.&nbsp; We will not  knowingly collect personally identifiable information on users under the age of  13 without parental consent. <strong>&nbsp;If you are under 13, please do not email us,  contact our website, attempt to use our website, submit information to our website,  or ask us to email you.&nbsp; If you are under  the age of 18, you should get permission from a parent or guardian before you  email our website, contact our website, attempt to use our website, submit  information to our website or ask us to email you.</strong></p>
					  <h2>Links To / From  Other Sites</h2>
					  <p>Our website contains  links to other Internet websites which we do not operate and, conversely, other  Internet websites may contain links to our website.&nbsp; We are not aware of and are not responsible  for the privacy policies, practices or content of such other websites.&nbsp; We encourage visitors to read and become  familiar with the privacy policies maintained by such other websites. </p>
					  <h2>Opt-Out</h2>
					  <p>If you no longer wish  to receive informational, marketing, or promotional communications from us, you  may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each  communication or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@flashseats.com">unsubscribe@flashseats.com</a> from the email address used to identify your account with “Unsubscribe ALL” in  the subject line.&nbsp; You are not able to  opt-out of emails relating to specific transactions that you have placed with  us or to the status of active accounts.</p>
					  <h2>Cookies</h2>
					  <p>A “cookie” is a small  piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your  computer’s hard drive.&nbsp; Cookies do not  damage your computer.&nbsp; We use cookies on  certain pages of our site.&nbsp; We may also  offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie.  Among other reasons why we use cookies, cookies allow you to enter your password  less frequently during a session.&nbsp;  Cookies can also help us provide information which is targeted to your  interests.&nbsp; Cookies are stored on your  hard drive, not on our site.&nbsp; If you do  not desire the functionality created by cookies, you have the option to disable  that function.&nbsp; To disable the cookie function, you may disable the function on your  browser.</p>
					  <h2>Security</h2>
			    <p>
					    The  Company uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your  personal identifiable information, such as firewalls, system security measures  and Secure Socket Layers (“SSL”). Please be advised that “perfect security”  does not exist in commercial Internet applications and that such security  measures may not prevent all loss, misuse or alteration of information on our websites.&nbsp; Therefore, although we work very hard to  protect your privacy, we do not promise and you should not expect, that your  personal information or private communications will always remain private. <br>
					    The registration pages, where you enter your personal and credit  card information, are secure.&nbsp; This means  that any information you send us is protected by encryption.&nbsp; Additionally, anytime we ask for your credit  card number, we transmit that number using SSL encryption.&nbsp; It is easy to tell when you are protected by encryption – your browser  displays a lock or a key which is no longer broken or it changes color when you  are on a secure page.&nbsp; The actual icon  and its location may vary depending on your browser.&nbsp; For example, Internet Explorer has a  “Security” padlock icon at the bottom right of the page, which appears closed  when you have entered a secure page.&nbsp; <br>
					    Except as specifically  permitted by this section, you may not disclose your Flash Seats password to  any third parties nor share it with any third parties. If you lose control of  your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally  identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on  your behalf.&nbsp; Therefore, if your password  has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your  password.<br>
			      If you have any questions  related to this policy, please email the Flash Seats Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@flashseats.com">privacy@flashseats.com</a>.</p>
