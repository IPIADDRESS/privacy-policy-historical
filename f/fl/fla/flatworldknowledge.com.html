<h1>Boston Academic Publishing, Inc., d.b.a. FlatWorld, Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy (“Policy”) explains the information practices of Boston Academic Publishing, Inc., d.b.a. FlatWorld (“FlatWorld,” also “we,” “our,” and “us”) related to the flatworld.com, fwk.com and flatworldknowledge.com websites, and the products and services offered through those websites (collectively the “Products”). You agree to the terms of this Policy as set forth in our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>This policy does not cover the privacy practices of third parties, such as the practices of third-party payment processing or delivery services, or our partners and/or advertisers. In addition, our site may contain links to the websites or services of third parties. Such third-party services and websites operate independently of the Service and each has its own privacy and security practices. We encourage you to review their policies before submitting any personal information to them.</p>
<h2>I. Information FlatWorld collects about you</h2>
<p>FlatWorld collects information from you as described in this Policy, including when you register with FlatWorld, and when you download, access or use any of the Products. “Personally identifiable information” refers to information we collect that permits a specific individual to be contacted physically or online.</p>
<h3>A. Information You Provide Directly to Us</h3>
<p>When you create a registered member account, we request that you provide certain information, including your name and email address, institutional affiliation, phone number, and the like.</p>

<p>When you communicate with us, through the Products or otherwise, you may also provide us with information. For example, if you email us regarding an order, you will provide us with your email address, and the information contained without your email. We also offer chat solutions, for example in connection with user support, which may be hosted by us or third parties, and we collect the information you provide during those sessions.</p>
<h3>B. Information We Receive From Third Parties</h3>
<p>We may collect, purchase, request or otherwise receive information about you, including personally-identifiable information, from third-party sources, including your employer or educational institution.

<p>California Online Privacy Protection Act Notice Concerning Do Not Track Signals</p>
<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers and is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so here.</p>

<p>With resellers and others who carry our content. We may make certain FlatWorld content available on other platforms, but do not share personally identifiable information with those other platforms. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of those third parties before sharing personal information with them.</p>
<p>We may disclose to anyone, including third parties or the general public, the names of educators and institutions who have adopted certain Products for use in their classes.</p>
<p>Third Party Service Providers. We use other companies, agents, contractors, and/or FlatWorld affiliates to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with providing the Products to you. For example, we may engage such service providers to provide marketing (including telemarketing, email and direct mail marketing), communications, website hosting infrastructure and IT services, personalize and optimize the Service, process credit card transactions, provide customer service, collect debts, and analyze and enhance data. In the course of providing such services to us, these other companies may have access to your information, or may share with us information they collect in the course of providing their services. We do not authorize these companies to use or disclose your personal information, except in connection with providing the services we request from them.</p>
<p>For legal and safety reasons. We reserve the right to disclose your information, including your personally identifiable information, when we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is necessary to (a) comply with any law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; (b) enforce our terms of use, including investigation of potential violations of our terms of use; (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect against harm to our rights, property, or safety, or those of our employees, users, or the public, as required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>If we receive notice that User Content you have posted to or through the Products may infringe the rights of third parties, including their intellectual property rights, we reserve the right (in our sole discretion) to disclose information, including personally identifiable information, about you to those third parties, so that they can contact you directly regarding their concern.</p>
<p>Change of Control. If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets, including bankruptcy, our assets, including Member account information and personally identifiable information, may be transferred to a third party. At that time, your Member account information and personally identifiable information may become subject to that third-party’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>Public forums</p>
<p>Some of the Products may, from time to time, make chat rooms, message boards, news groups and/or other public forums available to users. Any information that is disclosed in such forums is available to all other users of such features and may become publicly available.</p>
<p>Children’s' privacy</p>
<p>You must be 13 years of age or older to use the Products. FlatWorld does not solicit orders or knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.

<p>International transfer of Information</p>

You understand that the countries to which we may transfer Information may not have as comprehensive a level of data protection as in your country.</p>
<p>Third-party links</p>
<p>You may find links to third-party websites from any of the Products. These websites may have their own privacy, cookies and/or other policies, which you should check. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for their policies because we have no control over them.</p>
<p>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the “Shine the Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we may have disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year, including the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge.
