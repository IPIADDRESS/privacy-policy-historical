This is only done locally in your browser and this data is never sent to us. </p> <p><strong>Within the Extension, meaning in your browser, under your control and not being sent to us</strong>, current measures to detect activity / inactivity are</p> <ul> <li>browsing data and timestamps, specifically URLs you visit (including previously visited pages) and the page title, on some multi-author pages (currently youtube.com only) the author of the respective webpage, <ul> <li>information about tabs (creating, selecting, moving or closing tabs in the user interface, including which window and at which position the tab was created, as well as which window created it in case of popups, and whether a tab is audible and/or muted and also when this status changes), </li> <li>page load statuses to identify error pages, and browser idle state changes. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Also <strong>within the Extension, meaning in your browser, under your control and not being sent to us</strong>, we record </p> <ul> <li>interaction data and timestamps, specifically <ul> <li>the occurrence of mouse movement, </li> <li>clicking, scrolling (including beginning and end scroll positions, as well as page width / height), </li> <li>zooming (including the zoom level) and </li> <li>the occurrence of keys being pressed. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Even within the Extension, we never record your mouse position and / or the exact keys you press.</p> <p>Again please note, that this data is recorded only in the Extension and thus only on your device. <strong>This data will never be sent to us or any other party.</strong> It is used to determine your activity and engagement with sites and which sites will get your flattrs.
