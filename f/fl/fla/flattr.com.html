            Your protection and data confidentiality is of utmost importance to us (“<b>Flattr</b>” “<b>we</b>” “<b>our</b>”); that is why we take protecting your personal data very seriously. Nevertheless, some personal data is necessary to provide the services of our website <a href="https://flattr.com">flattr.com</a> (hereinafter referred to “Website”), and our extension (hereinafter referred to as “<b>Extension</b>”, Website and Extension hereinafter referred to as “<b>Services</b>”). This Privacy Policy shall inform you about the personal data we collect and how exactly that data is used. We gather and use personal data firmly within the provisions of the data protection laws of Sweden. In the following text we will inform you about the specific data, the scope and the purpose of the collection and use of personal data by us when using the Services.
            <br>
            The Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Flattr does not own or control, or to individuals that Flattr does not employ or manage.<br>
            “<b>You</b>”, “<b>Your</b>” and “<b>Yourself</b>” refer to anyone visiting our Website or using the Extension.
        </p>

        <h2>Who is responsible for the data processing?</h2>
        <p>
            The legal person responsible for the collection, processing and / or use of personal data in connection with all Flattr Services (“Controller”) is:
            <br><br>
            Flattr AB<br>
            Box 4111<br>
            20312 Malmö<br>
            Sweden<br><br>

            If you have any questions regarding your personal data, please contact us at <a href="https://flattr.com/contact">flattr.com/contact</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>What is personal data?</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of data protection is to protect personal data. Personal data means
            any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“<b>data subject</b>”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location
            data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological,
            genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
            <br><br>
            This information includes, for example, details such as name, postal address, email address or telephone number, but also nicknames and / or information about your interests.
        </p>

        <h2>What kind of data do we collect and process and how?</h2>
        <p>
            We collect as little data as possible to provide our services sufficiently. We do collect some, but very little data on (i) the Website and (ii) the Extension.
        </p>

        <h3>Website</h3>
        <h4>Website logs</h4>
        <p>
            When you use the Website, we automatically record website logs and thereby collecting the following traffic data for technical and for security reasons only:
            </p><ul>
                <li>IP address</li>
                <li>Internet Service Provider (ISP) information</li>
                <li>Date and time of access</li>
                <li>Operating system</li>
                <li>Browser type / version</li>
                <li>URL of previously visited webpage</li>
                <li>Amount of data sent</li>
            </ul>
            This data is stored purely for technical reasons and cannot be linked to any individual person. We are not combining the website log data with any other information about you.
        <p></p>

        <h4>Your Flattr account</h4>
        <p>As the Extension’s main functionality is to contribute to the content that you love and for content creators or publishers to receive this money, to make use of all its advantages, independent from your role, you have to register by adding an email address and choosing a password. We may use your email address to verify it, to respond to your requests, send you reports, transfer subscription payments, etc.</p>
        <p>To create your account, you further need to enter your name and, if applicable, the name of your business, date of birth, nationality and your country of residence. This data is needed for processing transactions.</p>
        <p>Depending on your role, you need to provide us with additional personal data:</p>

        <h5>Contributor accounts</h5>
        <p>As a user who is only using the Services for contributing to content (hereinafter referred to as “<b>Contributor</b>”), you must provide us with your payment information (as credit card) in order to <a href="#transactions-collection-data" class="scroll-to-link">process your contributions</a> to content creators or publishers you have flattred.</p>

        <h5>Individual creator accounts</h5>
        <p>As a individual content creator who can both receive payments and contribute to content, you must also enter payment information in order to <a href="#transactions-collection-data" class="scroll-to-link">process your contributions</a> to content creators you have flattred. For regulatory reasons, our payment provider must verify your account before you can withdraw any contributions. In this case, you need to provide our payment provider with a copy of your passport and a postal address. If you are representing a registered business, our payment provider will need further <a href="#verification-information" class="scroll-to-link">information</a> in order to verify your account.</p>
        <p>For receiving contributions, you must also enter the website(s) where your content is published and / or log in to the respective social media platforms and create a public <a href="#profile" class="scroll-to-link">profile</a> to help Flattr users to identify you more easily.</p>
        <p>Content creators can be individuals, organizations or businesses.</p>

        <h5>Publisher accounts</h5>
        <p>As a business or organization publishing content, you must enter the website(s) where your content is published and / or connect any social media platforms you produce content on, as well as bank information, in order to receive contributions. This includes your postal address and details of your bank account.</p>
        <p>For regulatory reasons, our payment provider must verify your account before you can withdraw any contributions. This requires you to provide the payment provider with further <a href="#verification-information" class="scroll-to-link">information</a>.</p>
        <p>You also need to create a public <a href="#profile" class="scroll-to-link">profile</a> to help Flattr users to identify you more easily.</p>

        <h5 id="profile">Profiles</h5>
        <p>In order to help Flattr users to identify you more easily when contributing to your content, you need to create a public profile where you may enter a name, which will be displayed in connection with your profile, a profile headline and a description about you or the company you are representing. Further, you may upload a company logo and / or a cover image.</p>

        <h4 id="transactions-collection-data">Transactions and collection of data</h4>
        <p>All transactions will be carried out by an external payment provider via the payment provider’s system (currently MANGOPAY SA, seated in Luxembourg). Flattr will have access to those transactions for support reasons.</p>
        <h5 id="verification-information">Verification information</h5>
        <p>
            Because of legal obligations related to the payment provider’s license as an Electronic Money Issuer, the payment provider must verify your account before you can withdraw any money. These verification obligations are necessary in order to fight fraud, money laundering and the financing of terrorism.<br>
            The verification process requires you to upload specific information and / or documents, which will be stored on our payment provider’s systems.<br>
            The information / documents you must upload include:
            </p><ul>
                <li>A copy of your or your legal representative’s passport</li>
                <li>A copy proving your registration as a company</li>
                <li>A copy of the articles of association</li>
                <li>A shareholder declaration</li>
                <li>Other documents proofing the identity, if required</li>
            </ul>
        <p></p>

        <h3 id="flattr-extension">Flattr Extension</h3>
        <p>
            For the purpose of providing the Services, which includes what content will be flattred, the Extension automatically collects data. The Extension runs in your browser on your device. All data collected when using the Extension will be stored and used in the Extension itself and will not be transferred to Flattr and / or eyeo GmbH (Flattr’s parent company) and, of course, not to any other third party, except for the URL you have flattered, which will be transferred to Flattr. This data is used by the Extension to decide automatically when and what will be flattred.
            The Extension collects and uses the following data to flattr the respective content:
        </p>
        <h4>Information related to the Extension</h4>
        <p>
            When using the Extension, we will automatically collect the following data:
            </p><ul>
                <li>Extension ID and version</li>
                <li>Operating system</li>
                <li>Extension state changes</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>authentication</li>
                    <li>update and reason for update</li>
                    <li>startup</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            This information will be used for improving our Services and for security purposes.
        <p></p>
        <p>Extension ID and version will be exchanged with <a href="https://flattr.com">flattr.com</a> for the purposes of transferring flattrs.</p>

        <h4>Your browsing behavior in the Extension</h4>
        <p>
            The function of the extension is to determine what content (normally a URL) to flattr. Within the Extension only, we record interaction and navigation data to identify the content to flattr so your Flattrs are actually giving the content you consume and give engagement and attention. This is only done locally in your browser and this data is never sent to us. Current measures to detect activity / inactivity are navigation data and timestamps, specifically URLs you visit (including ones that were open when enabling the Extension and the page title), author of the respective website (if applicable), information about tabs (creating, selecting, moving or closing tabs in the user interface, including which window and at which position the tab was created, as well as which window created it in case of popups) and browser idle state changes. Interaction data and timestamps, specifically the occurrence of mouse movement, clicking, scrolling (including beginning and end scroll positions, as well as page width / height), zooming (including the zoom level) and the occurrence of keys being pressed. Even within the Extension, we never record your mouse position and / or the exact keys you press.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again please note, that this data is recorded only in the Extension and thus only on your device. <b>This data will never be sent to us or any other party.</b> It is used to determine your activity and engagement with sites and which sites will get your Flattrs. This is how we guarantee the proper functioning of the extension and the payment to content creators.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only the information about which sites should receive your Flattrs will be transferred and processed for the payment of the content creators.
        </p>

        <h4>Recording of your interaction with the Extension</h4>
        <p>
            Further, the Extension records your interaction with the Extension, including time stamps, as follows:
            </p><ul>
                <li>Adding or removing domains to or from your own <a href="/faq">flattr enabled disabled lists</a></li>
                <li>Manually flattring URLs</li>
                <li>Looking at your list of Flattrs</li>
            </ul>
        <p></p>

        <h4>What happens when you flattr content?</h4>
        <p>Content creators and publishers will be provided with information about the country where the Contributor flattered the respective content is seated, as well as the amount of the contribution in order to fulfil tax law requirements and for reporting reasons. We will transfer this data in data sets; not individually and not containing any other information about you.</p>

Such data will be restricted to the data listed in the Declaration of Consent and will be only transferred if you opt in to provide us with beta feedback. Please find the respective Declaration of Consent <a href="/privacy/consent">here</a>. You can opt out from this at any time in the settings of the Flattr extension.</p>

        <h4>Anonymization of your data when providing feedback</h4>
        <p>In order to protect your personal data, all URLs, page titles, domains (except the ones stated below) and authors of the content viewed on the respective domain will be replaced by an increasing series of numbers before sending the information to our servers, which are protected by TLS encryption. Thus, we do not know what you have been surfing, only the fact that you have been surfing.</p>

        <p>Because we might develop customized solutions for multi-author platforms in order to pay out the respective author that has been flattered, the domains (and only the domains, not the URLs) of multi-author platforms, as but not limited to Youtube.com and Wordpress.com (full list <a href="/privacy/domains">here</a>), will not be replaced by an increasing series of numbers.</p>

        <p>We do not combine the collected data with any other information about you. The data we collect is statistical data, therefore we do not know who generated it.</p>
