<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>1. Collection of Information.</strong></span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>1.1 Survey Information.</strong></span><br>
Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;and it’s associated websites collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a Raposo International Enterprises Inc. and it’s associated websites survey, order form, or a registration pages either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a “Survey”). (As used herein, “online” means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and “offline” means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;and it’s associated websites or a third party (a “Third Party”) may ask an individual to provide various information to Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;and it’s associated websites, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, health history, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, “Survey Information”). Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;and it’s associated websites may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;and it’s associated websites or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;and it’s associated websites or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;and it’s associated websites.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>1.2 Other Information.</strong></span><br>
Other occasions when Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;and it’s associated websites obtain information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;and it’s associated websites or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;and it’s associated websites customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Raposo International Enterprises Inc. and it’s associated websites service or newsletter (together, “Other Information”).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>1.3 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</strong></span><br>
Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;and it’s associated websites currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;and it’s associated websites may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, “Technology Information”).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>(a) Cookies.</strong></span><br>
A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual’s computer that allows Raposo International Enterprises Inc. and it’s associated websites to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;and it’s associated websites database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>(b) Web Beacons.</strong></span><br>
A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function — see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual’s unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;and it’s associated websites to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioural habits for marketing purposes. For example, Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;and it’s associated websites might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party’s website where clothing products are sold. When Bob, an individual listed in Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;and it’s associated websites database, visits the clothing Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;would then update Bob’s profile with the information that Bob&nbsp;is interested in clothing. Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;may thereafter present offers of clothing related products and services to Bob. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;database.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>(c) New Technology.</strong></span><br>
The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;and it’s associated websites use of new and evolving technology. As a result, Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>1.4 Outside Information.</strong></span><br>

<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>1.5 Individual Information.</strong></span><br>

If Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, Raposo International Enterprises Inc. has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. Raposo International Enterprises Inc.&nbsp;has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).</p>
