			<p><br>
				We at <b>Coldwell Banker Residential&nbsp;Real Estate, Inc.</b> (referred to as <b>"Coldwell 
					Banker," "We," "Us," or "Our"</b>) recognize the importance of protecting 
				the privacy of certain information collected about the <b>users and visitors</b>
				of Our Web Site (referred to as <b>"User," "You" or "Your"</b>). This Privacy 
				Policy discloses what information We gather, how We use it, and how to correct 
				or change it. At Coldwell Banker, it is Our intention to give You an 
				understanding about how We collect Your information and the use We make of it 
				in the course of Our business.
			</p>
			<p>To that end, Coldwell Banker gathers two types of information about You: 1) data 
				that Users provide through optional, voluntary registration on Our Web Site, 
				and 2) data that Coldwell Banker gathers through aggregated tracking, mainly by 
				tallying Web pages that are viewed by Users throughout Our Web Site.
			</p>
			<p>However, be assured that Coldwell Banker will not disclose Personal Information 
				(as defined herein) to third parties without Your consent, except as may be 
				noted in this Privacy Policy or disclosed to You when the information is 
				submitted.
			</p>
			<p><b><u>How Does Coldwell Banker Collect Information?</u></b>
			</p>
			<p><u>Optional Registration</u> We collect information by specifically requesting 
				it from You. Generally this occurs when You register at the Web Site or request 
				information or a service. Usually, We and Our business partners use Your 
				information to operate the Web Site and to deliver services. Coldwell Banker 
				also uses Your information to inform You about other products and/or services 
				available from Coldwell Banker and Coldwell Banker-affiliates.
			</p>
			<p><u>Use of Tracking</u> Use of Internet Protocol ("IP") Addresses:
			</p>
			<p>An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to Your computer 
				whenever You are surfing the Internet so that Your computer can be identified 
				by the main computers, known as "Web servers," that "serve up" Web pages. This 
				allows Us to identify and gather general information and data about You, such 
				as the Web pages You view.
			</p>
			<p>Coldwell Banker collects IP addresses for the purposes of: helping Us diagnose 
				problems with Our main computers, for system administration, to report 
				aggregated information to Our business partners, and to audit the use of Our 
				Web Site. When Users request Web pages from Our Web Site, Our Web servers log 
				the User's IP address. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything 
				personally identifiable, which means that a User's session will be logged, but 
				the User will remain anonymous to Us. For example, We collect and/or track the 
				home server domain name, the type of computer, and the type of Web browser used 
				by You to access this Web Site. Such collection and tracking information is 
				gathered by Us as You navigate through this Web Site, and shall be used by Us 
				for Our business purposes only.
			</p>
			<p>We can, and will, use IP addresses to identify You when We feel it is necessary 
				to enforce compliance with Our Web Site Terms of Use or to protect Our service, 
				site, Users, or others.
			</p>
			<p><u>Use Of Cookies</u> What are cookies? Cookies are small pieces of information 
				that a Web site sends to Your computer for record-keeping purposes, which 
				information is stored in a file on Your computer's hard drive. Cookies make Web 
				surfing easier for You by saving Your preferences so that We can use the saved 
				information to facilitate Your use of Our Web Site when You return to the Web 
				Site. Cookies do not tell Us Your individual identity unless You have chosen to 
				provide it to Us. We never save passwords or credit card information in 
				cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and as such, You will find 
				that most major Web sites use them.
			</p>
			<p>By showing how and when Users use the Web Site, cookies help Us see which areas 
				of the Web Site are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to 
				the Web Site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages 
				viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies.
			</p>
			<p>Most cookies expire after a defined period of time, or You can delete Your 
				cookie file at any time. Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept 
				cookies. You can reset Your Web browser to refuse cookies or to indicate when a 
				cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of Coldwell Banker and/or 
				Coldwell Banker-affiliates' services will not function properly or may be 
				considerably slower if You refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, You 
				will not be able to set personalized preferences, and/or may have difficulty 
				completing marketing transactions.
			</p>
			<p>Coldwell Banker and/or Coldwell Banker-affiliates have two (2) primary uses for 
				cookies. First, We use them to specify a User's preferences. Second, We use 
				cookies to track Web site usage trends and patterns. This helps Us understand 
				Our Users' needs better and improve areas of Our Web Site. While both of these 
				activities depend on the use of cookies, You have the option of disabling 
				(refusing) the cookies via Your Web browser preferences.
			</p>
			<p>You may occasionally get cookies from Our business partners. Coldwell Banker 
				and/or Coldwell Banker-affiliates do not control these cookies. The use of 
				advertising cookies sent by such third-party Web servers is standard in the 
				Internet industry.
			</p>
			<p><b><u>With Whom Does Coldwell Banker Share Information?</u></b>
			</p>
			<p>As a general rule, Coldwell Banker will not disclose any specific personal 
				information that You submit to Us about You ("<b>Personal Information</b>") in 
				a manner that connects You with the Personal Information, except when We have 
				Your permission or under special circumstances, such as when We believe in good 
				faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. The 
				following describes some of the ways that Your Personal Information may be 
				disclosed.
			</p>
			<p><u>Business Partners &amp; Sponsors</u>: Coldwell Banker may disclose some or 
				all of Your Personal Information to business partners or sponsors, but this use 
				will be specifically described to You prior to data collection or prior to 
				transferring the data. Many promotions offer opportunities to request 
				additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, You give 
				Coldwell Banker permission to transfer Your Personal Information to the sponsor 
				so they can fulfill Your request. In many instances, only Your e-mail address 
				will be shared. If more Personal Information will be shared with the sponsor, 
				You will be notified prior to the transfer.
			</p>
			<p><u>Third Party &amp; Aggregate Data</u>: From time to time, You may be offered 
				the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If 
				You opt to receive information from these third parties, Coldwell Banker will 
				(with Your permission) share Your name and e-mail address with such third 
				parties. Under confidentiality agreements, Coldwell Banker may match Personal 
				Information with third party data. Also, Coldwell Banker may keep track of what 
				portions of the Web Site Users are visiting and other User statistics, and 
				aggregate this information to help Us create a better experience for Users of 
				Our Web Site. This is all done without knowing Your name or other Personal 
				Information in order to describe Our viewers and services to prospective 
				partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
			</p>
			<p><u>Other</u>: Coldwell Banker may also disclose account information in special 
				cases when We have reason to believe that disclosing this information is 
				necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be 
				violating Our Terms of Use, or may be causing injury to or interference (either 
				intentionally or unintentionally) with any of Coldwell Banker's rights or 
				property, other Users, or anyone else. Coldwell Banker may disclose or access 
				account information when We believe in good faith that the law requires it and 
				for administrative and other purposes that We deem necessary to maintain, 
				service, and improve Our products and services.
			</p>
			<p><b>How Can You Control The Usage Of Information? </b>
			</p>
			<p>In case You change Your mind or some Personal Information changes (such as Your 
				zip code or e-mail address), We will try to provide a way to correct, update or 
				remove the Personal Information that You give us. We also give You the 
				opportunity to control the communications We direct to You. If a User wishes to 
				update Personal Information or objects to any usage provided herein for any 
				reason, he/she may e-mail the requested change to: <a href="mailto:GetAnswers@ColdwellBanker.com">
					GetAnswers@ColdwellBanker.com</a>
			</p>
			<p><b><u>What Happens When You Link To A Third Party Site?</u></b>
			</p>
			<p>You should be aware that when You are on Coldwell Banker's and/or Coldwell 
				Banker-affiliates' Web site You can hyperlink, or be directed to, other Web 
				sites that are beyond Our control and/or outside Our service. For example, if 
				You "click" on a banner advertisement or a Coldwell Banker search result, the 
				"click" may transfer You off Our Web Site. These other Web sites may include 
				sites of advertisers, sponsors, and partners that may use Our and/or Coldwell 
				Banker-affiliates' logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Web 
				sites may send their own cookies to Users, collect data, or solicit 
				Information.
			</p>
			<p>Coldwell Banker and Coldwell Banker-affiliates do not control such Web sites, 
				and, therefore, are not responsible for their contents or the hyperlinks or 
				advertising they choose to place on such Web sites. Coldwell Banker's and/or 
				Coldwell Banker-affiliates' inclusion of hyperlinks to these Web sites do not 
				imply any endorsement of the material on such Web sites or any association with 
				their operators. Our Privacy Policy does not extend to anything that is 
				inherent in the operation of the Internet, which is beyond Coldwell Banker's 
				and/or Coldwell Banker-affiliates' control.
			</p>
			<p>Please keep in mind that whenever You give out information on-line (for example, 
				via message boards or forums) that information can be collected and used by 
				people You do not know. While Coldwell Banker and Coldwell Banker-affiliates 
				strive to protect Users' information and privacy, We cannot guarantee the 
				security of any information You disclose on-line, and You disclose such 
				information at Your own risk.
			</p>
			<p><b><u>Is Information Secure From Others Using The Coldwell Banker Web Site?</u></b>
			</p>
			<p>The security of all information associated with Our Users is an important 
				concern to Us. We exercise care in providing secure transmission of Your 
				information from Your computer to Our servers. Unfortunately, no data 
				transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a 
				result, while We strive to protect Your information, Coldwell Banker and 
				Coldwell Banker-affiliates can't ensure or warrant the security of any 
				information You transmit to Us or from Our on-line products or services, and 
				You do so at Your own risk. Once We receive Your transmission, Coldwell Banker 
				uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of Your 
				information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers (SSL). However, 
				"perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
			</p>
			<p><b>YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b>
			</p>
			<p>By using Our Web Site, You signify Your agreement to Coldwell Banker's Privacy 
				Policy. <b>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS WEB 
					SITE</b>. Your continued use of Coldwell Banker's and/or Coldwell Banker- 
				affiliates' Web sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean 
				You accept those changes.
