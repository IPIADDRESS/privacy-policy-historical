<h2 id="privacy-header">Privacy Policy</h2>
<div class="clearfix" id="privacy-page">
<p>We built Flowdock to make it easy to communicate and collaborate with your team. Your privacy and security is our top priority. You can choose what to say and share with your members in flows, but we want you to know that no one outside of your team will be able to access that private and sensitive information.</p>
<p>Flowdock Ltd ("Flowdock") operates the website <a href="http://flowdock.com">flowdock.com</a>. It is Flowdock's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information you share or we may collect while operating our website. This document explains how we will use the information that you provide to us via the service.</p>
<h3>Information Gathering and Usage</h3>
<p>When you register for Flowdock we may ask for information such as your name, email address and self-chosen team or organization name. Also your PayPal account name and Flowdock-specific pre-approved payment details will be saved on PayPal billing integration. Flowdock uses collected information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, and research.</p>
<p>The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of other terms of the service, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
<li>We transfer information about you if Flowdock is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Flowdock will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Flowdock takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Access to the production environment is restricted to only authorized personnel. Even though the software has automated tests for every feature, for any problems concerning payments or billing, a warning email is sent to our administrators to quickly track down all the possible concerns. Especially payment-related data is automatically verified before any action is taken. Our fault-tolerant server environment is situated in a commercial, physically protected data center. All traffic is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or other encrypted tunnels.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Flowdock uses cookies to help Flowdock identify and track visitors, their website access preferences, and their usage of Flowdock website. Certain features of Flowdock's website, including logging in, do not function properly without the aid of cookies. No personally identifiable statistics are gathered using cookies nor they will be shared with any outside companies without your permission.</p>
<h3>Data storage</h3>
<p>Flowdock may use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run Flowdock. Although Flowdock owns the code, databases, and all rights to the Flowdock application, you retain all rights to your data. When you use the messaging or file upload features of Flowdock, the data you submit is retained on the servers of our third party service provider. Flowdock Ltd. does not access or use this data for any purpose other than providing the service, but you should be aware that these files are not encrypted and that they could be disclosed in legal proceedings or investigations.</p>
<h3>Disclosure</h3>
<p>Flowdock may disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate terms of the service. It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including without limitation, fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise permitted or required by law.</p>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Flowdock may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Flowdock's sole discretion. All changes will be published at this web address. For any more significant changes in how we treat personal information, we will notify users by sending a notice to the email address specified in the email that you have provided or by placing a prominent notice on our site or blog. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
