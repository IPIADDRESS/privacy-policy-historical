            <p><em>Effective Date: March 23, 2016</em></p>
            
            <p>CA Technologies ("CA Technologies") has created this Privacy Statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on <a href="http://www.ca.com/us/privacy">www.ca.com</a>, <a href="http://www.flowdock.com">www.flowdock.com</a>, and other websites operated by CA Technologies (each, a "Site") and the Services (defined below), is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. CA Technologies reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to add, delete or modify any of the terms contained in this Statement, at any time, upon notice by posting a change notice to the footer of the Site and to the Statement.  In the event of substantive changes to the terms of this Statement, CA Technologies will notify You in writing at least 30 days prior to such change becoming effective.  If any modification is unacceptable to You, You should not visit the Site and cease using Services.  Your continued use of the Services following written notice of a change will constitute binding acceptance of the changes. For purposes of this Statement, "You" means any consumer using the Site or Services on their own behalf and not on behalf of an entity, company, or other third-party.</p>
            
            <p>This Statement applies to visitors to the Site and users of the Service who are consumers using Services on their own behalf, including You. This Statement does not apply to (a) CA Technologies corporate or enterprise customers who have entered into a separate agreement with CA Technologies, or (b) the practices of third parties that CA Technologies does not own or control, or to individuals that CA Technologies does not employ or manage.</p>
            
            <h3>1. U.S. - EU Safe Harbor</h3>
            
            <p>The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions (the "Safe Harbor Principles") to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the EU law requirement that personal information transferred from the EU to the United States be adequately protected. CA Technologies complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. CA Technologies has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view CA Technologies certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.</p>
            
            <p>CA Technologies primarily stores information collected from a Site and Data in the United States. CA Technologies may transfer and access such information and Data from around the world. You consent to the transfer and processing of Data in and to the United States.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Collection of Information</h3>
            
            <p>We may require consumers who register to use CA Technologies hosted services, associated mobile applications, or any other service or feature offered on or through our Sites ("Services") to give us contact information, such as their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of users within the organization that will be using the Services. At the time You express interest in attaining additional information, or when You register for a Service, we may also ask for additional personal information. You can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked. You can view Your updated profile to confirm the edits have been made.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, CA Technologies collects and retains information that You post, submit or store through Your use of the Service, Your Service account and/or on our Site. CA Technologies may collect information from third-parties about You or the organization You represent.  If You exchange any messages through our Site or through our Service, we will collect and store those as well.</p>
            
            <p>CA Technologies may also collect certain information from visitors to the Site or users of the Services, such as Internet addresses, using third party services such as Google Analytics, Salesforce, Eloqua and DemandBase. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site in order to constantly improve the quality of the Service. We may also collect, create, track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Use of Information</h3>
            
            <p>In general, information You submit to us or that we collect through the Site or Service is used either to respond to requests that You make, to provide You the Service, or to aid us in serving You better and improve our Services and other products.  CA Technologies uses the information that we collect to set up, provide, and bill for Services for individuals and to qualify prospective customers. For example, if You fill out a "Contact Me" web form, CA Technologies will use the information provided to respond to Your inquiry.</p>
            
            <p>We may also use the information to contact You to further discuss interest in our company, the Services that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. You may be invited to receive an email newsletter by providing an email address. Your email addresses and any personal information will not be distributed or shared with any third parties other than CA Technologies employees, consultants, representatives, and for some Services, anyone You invite to use the Services with You.</p>
            
            <p>We may also email information regarding updates to the Service or company, and will send a Customer Newsletter.  You can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by updating Your <a href="http://www.rallydev.com/communication-preferences">marketing email preferences</a>.</p>
            
            <p>You may use the Service to host data and information ("Data"). CA Technologies will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data except as provided in a separate CA Technologies subscription agreement governing access and use of a Service signed by CA Technologies and a customer ("CA Technologies Subscription Agreement"), including to resolve a problem or support issue; as may be required by law, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process; or if CA Technologies reasonably believes that use or disclosure is necessary to protect CA Technologies rights. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of Your user registration and password.</p>
            
            <p>We may retain Your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Statement unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Disclosure of Your Information</h3>
            
            <p>Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as provided for in a CA Technologies Subscription Agreement, or this Statement, we do not disclose to any third-party the information provided. CA Technologies uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing. Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on the Site but they are not permitted to collect any information nor does CA Technologies share any user information with these parties.</p>
            
            <p>If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend or other third party about our Site, we ask them for such third party's name and email address. CA Technologies will automatically send the third party a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site. CA Technologies does not store the third party's information.</p>
            
            <p>Some of the Services offer features and functionality that allow communication between users, such as bulletin boards, instant messaging, or chat rooms. Any personal information You choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send You unsolicited messages. CA Technologies is not responsible for the personal information You choose to submit to or through these channels or for any acts or omissions of other users who may access such information.</p>
            
            <p>CA Technologies may share Your information with third party service providers to provide You with the Services that we offer You; to facilitate Your use of the Service; to process any transactions You make through our Site or Service, or to provide technical support.  Except as set forth in this Statement, these third party service providers are required not to use Your information other than to provide the services requested by CA Technologies.  You expressly consent to the sharing of Your information with our contractors and other service providers for the sole purpose of providing services to You.</p>
            
            <p>We may release information when we believe that release is necessary or appropriate (a) under applicable law, including laws outside Your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside Your country of residence; (d) to enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our Affiliates; (f) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; and (g) to protect the rights, privacy, property, or safety of CA Technologies, our employees, our Affiliates, our users, or any other person or entity. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Affiliates</h3>
            
            <p>CA Technologies has a number of affiliates, subsidiaries, and other related companies (collectively, <strong>"Affiliates"</strong>).  We may share some or all of Your information with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Statement.  If another company acquires our company or our assets, that company will possess the information collected by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding Your information collected by us as described in this Statement.</p>
            
            <h3>6. Cookies</h3>
            
            <p>When You interact with the Site, we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When You come to our Site, our Web server sends a cookie to Your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the Site previously.</p>
            
            <p>Standing alone, cookies do not identify You personally. They merely recognize Your browser. Unless You choose to identify Yourself to CA Technologies, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or registering for a trial account, You remain anonymous to CA Technologies. Cookies come in two flavors: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They are deleted from Your computer when You close Your browser software or turn off Your computer. Persistent cookies remain on Your computer after You've closed Your browser or turned off Your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for Your browser.</p>
            
            <p>CA Technologies uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Site and Services to uniquely identify You while You are logged in. This information allows CA Technologies to process Your online transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure You are who You say You are after You've logged in and are required in order to use the Service. CA Technologies uses persistent cookies, that only CA Technologies can read and use, to identify that You are a CA Technologies customer or prior CA Technologies Site visitor (whatever the case may be). We do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.  Users who disable their web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Site but will not be able to successfully use our Service.</p>
            
            <h3>7. Third-Party Sites</h3>
            
            <p>The Site contains links to other web sites. CA Technologies is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other web sites. Customers and visitors will need to check the policy statement of these other web sites to understand their policies. Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information. It is Your responsibility to keep such information private and confidential.</p>
            
            <h3>8. Security</h3>
            
            <p>Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. When our Site is accessed using a supported browser, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that Data are safe, secure, and available only to You. CA Technologies also implements a security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Site in a server environment designed to be secure that uses a firewall and other technology designed to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, CA Technologies provides unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Data.</p>
            
            <p>CA Technologies may use third party vendors to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to provide the Service. When You use certain CA Technologies Services, Your Data are retained on our third-party data center's servers.</p>
            
            <h3>9. Correcting &amp; Updating Your Information</h3>
            
            <p>If You need to update or change registration information You may do so by editing Your user or organization record. To update billing information please email <a href="mailto:support@flowdock.com">support@flowdock.com</a> or update Your information online if available for certain Services. To discontinue the Service, please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@flowdock.com">support@flowdock.com</a> or, for some Services, You can cancel payments and delete Your account online. Please note that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that You began prior to requesting such change or deletion.</p>
