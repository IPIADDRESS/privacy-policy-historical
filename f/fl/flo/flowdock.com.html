  <h1 class="main-header">Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Flowdock we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
    <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
    <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>
  <p>Flowdock Ltd (“Flowdock”) operates the website flowdock.com. It is Flowdock’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.</p>

  <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
  <p>Like most website operators, Flowdock collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Flowdock’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Flowdock’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Flowdock may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
  <p>Flowdock also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Flowdock does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

  <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
  <p>Certain visitors to Flowdock’s websites choose to interact with Flowdock in ways that require Flowdock to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Flowdock gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for Flowdock at flowdock.com to provide their name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Flowdock – by purchasing a paid plan of Flowdock, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Flowdock collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Flowdock. Flowdock does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

  <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
  <p>Flowdock may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Flowdock may monitor the occurrence of logging in to better understand user activity. Flowdock may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Flowdock does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

  <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
  <p>Flowdock discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Flowdock’s behalf or to provide services available at Flowdock’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Flowdock’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Flowdock will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Flowdock discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Flowdock believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Flowdock, third parties or the public at large.</p>
  <p>If you are a registered user of Flowdock and have supplied your email address, Flowdock may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Flowdock and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Flowdock takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
  
  <h3>Cookies</h3>
  <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Flowdock uses cookies to help Flowdock identify and track visitors, their usage of Flowdock website, and their website access preferences. Flowdock visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Flowdock’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Flowdock’s website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
  
  <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
  <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Flowdock may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Flowdock’s sole discretion. Flowdock encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
