    <h2><a name="info"></a>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</h2>
  
    <p>Generally, you can visit our websites, read articles and other materials, 
    and check on offerings without giving us any "personal information" (defined 
    below). &nbsp;So that we can provide our users and subscribers with the most 
    efficient and enhanced personalized service, we request information about 
    you in certain circumstances, and collect certain information 
    automatically. &nbsp;We also use contact lists and other information we may 
    obtain from third parties. &nbsp;For the convenience of our customers and 
    better to serve you, a customer account includes all the collected personal 
    information we may have, but you can update or correct your contact 
    information or change your preferences about receiving offers and 
    information from us or third parties at any time.</p> 
  
    <h3><a name="info_personal"></a>Personal Information</h3>
  
    <p>By "personal information" we mean information that identifies you  
    individually, such as names, mailing addresses, and/or email addresses.  
    &nbsp;This term does not include other kinds of electronic information  
    which theoretically could be used to identify you, such as the IP address  
    of your computer (which, if combined with the time of access and  
    information from your internet service provider, could be used to identify  
    you by name). &nbsp;Such other electronic information also includes  
    browser type, domain name, the referring website address, etc. &nbsp;We  
    use this automatically collected electronic information to facilitate  
    your online experience at our websites.</p> 
    
    <p>We collect from you personal information when you subscribe to one of  
    our magazines, place an order (see the section below for more information  
    on subscriptions and orders), or register at one of our websites.  
    &nbsp;Website visitors may register to receive our email services, respond  
    to a survey, or enter online contests and sweepstakes; we may offer  
    offline contests and sweepstakes as well. &nbsp;Registration may be  
    required to participate in message boards, bulletin boards, or chat rooms  
    at our websites or to take advantage of special offers.</p>
    
    <p>Sometimes registration can be accomplished by submitting only a user  
    name and password, but some of our offerings require submission of  
    additional information. &nbsp;The information we collect may include your  
    email address, name, address, phone number, age, gender, hobbies, family  
    information, and similar demographic information or information related to  
    your interests. &nbsp;For example, our automotive publications and  
    websites may ask about the type of car you drive. Some of our sites may  
    offer you the opportunity to receive offers directly from third parties,  
    or to match you directly with a trusted fulfillment partner, such as an  
    automobile dealer or bank. &nbsp;In the latter case, in addition to  
    contact information and other details, we will ask you to provide certain  
    financial and credit-related information to facilitate a response from our  
    fulfillment partners. &nbsp;Our online registration forms will indicate  
    what information is required and what information (if any) is optional.  
    &nbsp;Of course, you may decline to provide even "required" information,  
    but will then be unable to participate in those website activities.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="info_sub"></a>Subscriptions and Orders</h3>
    
    <p>If you wish to subscribe to one of our publications or place an order  
    for products or services, you must generally establish a credit card  
    account with us or our vendors. &nbsp;In addition to the customary  
    information needed to fill your order (full name, email address, physical  
    address, ship-to name and address, gift information, etc.), subscriptions  
    and orders necessitate collection of your credit card number, credit card  
    expiration date, and the credit card security code. &nbsp;Electronic order  
    acknowledgments are sent when an subscription or order is placed online.  
    &nbsp;Most of our websites allow visitors to subscribe to our  
    publications online, and some sites also offer areas where you may  
    purchase items online. &nbsp;We may offer online and offline subscribers a  
    "bill me" option if they do not wish to use a credit card, but  
    visitors should check specific online stores to see if other such  
    alternative payment options are offered.</p> 
  
    <h3><a name="info_other"></a>Other Information</h3>
      
    <p>We conduct market research in an effort to improve our publications and 
    websites and may purchase lists of potential subscribers or customers from 
    third parties. &nbsp;Those lists may include information on current 
    subscribers or customers. &nbsp;This information is included in our 
    database. &nbsp;That helps us, for example, minimize multiple mailings and 
    emailings, and provide information tailored to your interests.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="collect"></a>WHAT DO WE DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION?</h2>
    
    <p>We use information you provide to fulfill your requests, improve our 
    publications, products and services, and operate our business. &nbsp;For 
    example, we use personal information so that we may display or send 
    custom, personalized content to our website visitors, and to send 
    newsletters, mail, emails, features, promotional material, surveys and 
    other updates, information or offers to our users and subscribers. &nbsp;A 
    user may, at any time, opt out of receiving promotional offers by mail, 
    telephone or email. &nbsp;We also use collected information to evaluate 
    and administer our products and services, fulfill customer requests (e.g., 
    subscription and other orders), respond to any problems that may arise 
    (e.g., magazine delivery failures, difficulties in navigating our sites or 
    accessing certain features), gauge user trends to determine what products 
    and services are most popular with users, and to put you in touch with 
    trusted fulfillment partners who can provide services that we cannot.</p>
    
    <p>In some parts of our websites we allow users to send articles or links 
    by email to other parties who may be interested in them. &nbsp;We do not 
    retain any email addresses (unless you are a member who already has 
    voluntarily provided your email address) of either the sender or recipient 
    of such articles or links after they are sent, and do not share "send 
    a friend" email addresses with third parties.</p>
    
    <p>We may produce reports for advertisers, sponsors and vendors containing 
    anonymous, aggregate information about our users and subscribers, such as 
    demographic, age and online usage information. &nbsp;This allows us to 
    provide content and offers that are most relevant to our subscribers and 
    users, and to work more closely with advertisers.</p>
  
    <h2><a name="share"></a>HOW DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
  
    <p>Personal information is available to InterMedia, including its brands and 
    affiliates, and its or their technical and fulfillment agents and 
    consultants who make this website and our publications, products and 
    services available to you. &nbsp;Anonymous information is available to our 
    advertisers, sponsors and promotional and business partners. &nbsp;We share 
    your personal information with third parties only as described below.</p>
    
    <p><a name="share_intermedia"></a><b><i>InterMedia and Its Agents</i></b>. 
    &nbsp;InterMedia may use both anonymous, aggregate demographic data and any 
    personal information you provide for internal marketing or other business 
    purposes, including sending you notices of subscription renewal deadlines, 
    new publications, services or products we offer likely to be of interest, 
    and filling subscription and other orders. &nbsp;To facilitate subscriptions 
    and orders, InterMedia will cache your order information, and create an 
    authorization with a merchant account (e.g., your credit card company). 
    &nbsp;There are many companies who may be required to assist InterMedia in 
    making its publications, products and web sites available to you. &nbsp;Web 
    host firms, technical and database consultants, advertising agencies, and 
    fulfillment firms, including firms assisting us in offering contests and 
    promotions, may have access to personally identifiable information in the 
    course of making our products and services available. &nbsp;All companies 
    working with InterMedia must comply with our information collection, use and 
    disclosure policies, and are not permitted to sell your information to third 
    parties or to use it except as authorized by us and you, or as permitted or 
    required by law.</p>
  
    <p><a name="share_vendor"></a><b><i>Participating Vendors</i></b>. 
    &nbsp;Some of our sites offer opportunities to make purchases online from 
    special participating vendors. &nbsp;On sites with online purchase 
    opportunities for products and merchandise, we will also give participating 
    manufacturers, retailers, wholesalers or distributors ordering information 
    and merchant bank authorization information. &nbsp;Any time you order from a 
    participating vendor, that vendor will automatically have all the 
    information related to the order. Participating vendors may use that 
    information to advise you directly of other products and offerings that they 
    provide. &nbsp;InterMedia is not responsible for their privacy policies, and 
    urges you to inquire about their information practices. &nbsp;In addition, 
    vendors may receive the same anonymous, aggregate data that our advertisers 
    do.</p>
    
    <p><a name="share_credit"></a><b><i>Credit Card Companies</i></b>. &nbsp;As 
    in any transaction, your credit card company will have all relevant 
    information about the name of the vendor, item(s) purchased, and date and 
    total cost. &nbsp;InterMedia will not otherwise provide any personal data to 
    your credit card company.</p>
    
    <p><a name="share_adv"></a><b><i>Advertisers, Sponsors and Promotional and 
    Business Partners</i></b>. &nbsp;We share anonymous, aggregate demographic 
    information (such as gender, age, income, hobbies, interests, etc.), and 
    anonymous information obtained from cookies and similar technologies, with 
    our advertisers, sponsors, promotional and business partners, and with 
    participating vendors at sites offering online sales opportunities. &nbsp;No 
    personally identifiable information is disclosed to any of these third 
    parties in providing these reports. &nbsp;Credit card numbers, bank account 
    numbers, and passwords are not shared with advertisers, sponsors or 
    promotional partners, and are only shared with specific vendors with whom 
    you place an online order.</p>
  
    <p>Offline and online contact information is handled differently. &nbsp;As 
    is customary in the publications business, offline contact information 
    (i.e., your name and mailing address) is shared with third parties who may 
    send you offers or information about their products or services. &nbsp;<b>
    You must opt-out if you do not wish for us to share such offline contact 
    information with third parties, or if you do not wish to receive 
    promotions from us by mail.</b></p>
    
    <p>We may extend email offers to you on behalf of our business partners 
    about their products or services, but only if you have indicated that you 
    would like to receive such offers. &nbsp;Although InterMedia may receive a 
    fee from our business partners for this service, InterMedia sends those 
    offers on behalf of the business partner, and does not share your email 
    address with them. &nbsp;Of course, you may opt-out of receiving those 
    offers at any time.</p>
    
    <p>At our websites, visitors will also have opportunities to sign up 
    directly with certain advertisers and sponsors to enter contests or 
    sweepstakes, receive email updates, or to receive information directly 
    from them. &nbsp;Third party vendors and advertisers will also use 
    technical and other consultants. &nbsp;We urge visitors to carefully 
    review the privacy policies of these firms. &nbsp;InterMedia is not 
    responsible for the privacy policies and procedures of any third party.
    </p>
    
    <p><b><i>Trusted Fulfillment Partners</i></b>. &nbsp;Sometimes we will 
    give you the opportunity to opt in to receive email offers directly from 
    third parties not affiliated with InterMedia. &nbsp;If you decide to 
    accept these offers, we will provide your contact information to the third 
    party. &nbsp;As our trusted fulfillment partners may keep and use your 
    information whether or not you purchase their products or use their 
    services, your personal information will be subject to their privacy 
    policies, and you should contact them directly for more information about 
    their specific privacy and opt-out policies.</p>
    
    <p><b><i>Public Postings</i></b>. &nbsp;You should be aware that if you 
    voluntarily disclose information, personal or otherwise, online in any 
    community area (whether through InterMedia's websites or any other service 
    available online), that information can be collected and used by others. 
    &nbsp;For example, if you use chat, forums, bulletin boards or message 
    boards, or if you post personal information online (such as your email 
    address, photograph, etc.), you may receive unsolicited messages from 
    others. &nbsp;InterMedia has no control over this use of your personal 
    information.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="share_note"></a>Important Note</h3>
    
    <p>We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or 
    consent as compelled by applicable law, regulation or legal requirement; to 
    conduct investigations of complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect 
    the integrity of our site and our property and assure adherence to our terms 
    of use; to protect the safety of our visitors or others; and to fulfill your 
    requests.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="cookies"></a>HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?</h2>
    
    <p>InterMedia may use "cookies" in connection with operation of its 
    websites. &nbsp;Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on 
    your computer by the InterMedia website server. &nbsp;Cookies are used for 
    record-keeping purposes_the stored information can be retrieved by the 
    InterMedia website server when you return to the website.</p>
  
    <p>Cookies allow us to personalize or regulate the use of our websites, and 
    also permit us to automate the access and data-entry functions of the site 
    (e.g., login information), to store on-line ordering information for 
    purchases you may make while visiting the site, and to tailor the appearance 
    or presentation of the site to your preferences or interests. &nbsp;In 
    general, we do not use cookies to track the navigational habits of 
    identified users without the user's consent.</p>
    
    <p>The use of cookies is common in the industry, and they are used at most 
    major websites. &nbsp;Cookies will not be used to pass any information from 
    your computer except the specific information placed into the cookie from 
    one participating InterMedia website when the cookie is retrieved by another 
    participating InterMedia website.</p>
    
    <p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to 
    prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser 
    notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies 
    altogether. &nbsp;Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used 
    by browser add-ons by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website 
    of its manufacturer. &nbsp;However, if you elect not to accept cookies, some 
    parts of the website may not function properly or permit access. &nbsp;For

    <h2><a name="beacons"></a>HOW DO WE USE WEB BEACONS?</h2>
  
    <p>We use Web beacon technologies throughout our sites in order to assess 
    traffic patterns, determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, 
    determine unique visitor counts and create an improved user experience 
    throughout our sites. &nbsp;Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique 
    identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are commonly used in the 
    industry and on many major websites. &nbsp;We also may include Web beacons 
    in promotional email messages or electronic newsletters in order to 
    determine the effectiveness of those campaigns.</p>
    
    <p>When a user accesses a page or email containing a "Web beacon", notice of 
    that access is generated and sent to us. &nbsp;Because Web beacons work in 
    conjunction with cookies, users who do not want this information considered 
    in association with anonymous cookie information should set their browsers 
    to turn off cookies. &nbsp;(When users turn off cookies, Web beacon 
    technologies will still detect users visits anonymously, but this 
    information cannot be associated with other user information and is 
    disregarded).</p>
      
    <h2><a name="thirdparty"></a>WHAT ABOUT THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS?</h2>
  
    <p>Some of the banner ads displayed in our websites are provided by outside 
    companies. These ads may use cookies and/or Web beacons. &nbsp;Unlike 
    cookies and Web beacons used by InterMedia in content it controls at its 
    websites, cookies or Web beacons received with banner ads are collected by 
    our advertisers and we do not have access to this information. &nbsp;We use 
    reputable third parties to serve some or all of the advertisements that are 
    placed within our sites and they may use information about your visits to 
    our sites and other sites to assist in serving advertisements to you. 
    &nbsp;They may share information with their clients such as date/time of the 
    banner ad shown, the specific ad shown, the IP address, etc. DoubleClick is 
    our third party ad server. &nbsp;If you would like to know more about their 
    information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures, please

    <h2><a name="personalinfo"></a>
    HOW CAN YOU CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
  
    <p>We believe that choice in how and when you are contacted is key to 
    customer satisfaction, so we offer several ways for you to update your 
    contact information or change your preferences.</p>
  
    <p>
      1. If you have an online account at one of our websites, you may be able 
         to log on and update or change your contact or account 
         information. &nbsp;Check the site for further information.<br>

         on and update or change your contact or account information by 
         contacting us at

         http://www.intermediaoutdoors.com/service</a>.<br>
    
      3. You may unsubscribe to any of our online email updates by following the
         unsubscribe instructions in the body of any message.<br>
    
      4. You may write to us and update your contact information or ask that we 
         not share your personal contact information with third parties. &nbsp;
         See the mailing address and fax number at the bottom of this privacy 
         policy. &nbsp;In those instances, we will retain your information in a 
         "do not promote" file in our database.<br>
    
      5. You may also contact us at 
         <b><i><a href="mailto:privacycoordinator@imoutdoors.com">
         privacycoordinator@imoutdoors.com</a></i></b>.
    </p>
  
    <p>We will try to implement your opt-out requests promptly, but you may 
    still receive promotional information from us by mail for up to 60 days due 
    to printing and mailing schedules, and up to 10 days for email; please 
    forgive any delay.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="security"></a>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
    
    <p>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt important 
    information (e.g., credit card data) while it is in-transit to/from us when 
    you are buying products or services over the Internet. &nbsp;We employ 
    appropriate, commercially reasonable security practices to protect your 
    personal information while stored at our facilities. &nbsp;Finally, we 
    engage suitable service providers to help us with managing this information, 
    and contractually require of them appropriate security assurances.</p>
    
    <p>Remember that your personal information may also be accessed by the 
    username and password you created when you registered at one of our websites 
    where user accounts are permitted. &nbsp;The confidentiality of any such 
    password is yours to protect. &nbsp;You may change it anytime by following 
    the instructions at the website where you registered. &nbsp;Take care to 
    safeguard your password; if you believe someone else may be using your 
    password, change it promptly. &nbsp;Remember, also, that any personal 
    information you post in chat rooms or message boards is available to anyone.
    </p>
    
    <p>While no security measure can guarantee against compromise, we regularly 
    review and update our security measures in an effort to provide appropriate 
    security for all information held by us.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="children"></a>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
    
    <p>Our websites are not for use by minors. &nbsp;We offer products and 
    services that may be appropriate for minors, but if you are under the age of 
    18 you may use our websites only with the involvement of a parent or 
    guardian. &nbsp;We take minors' privacy seriously, and ask minors (people 
    under the age of 18) not to send any personally identifiable information to 
    any of our websites without the consent of their parents or guardians. 
    &nbsp;Many of our websites include chat rooms, bulletin boards and other 
    features that may be unsuitable for minors and which are not necessarily 
    monitored. &nbsp;InterMedia encourages all parents and guardians to instruct 
    their children in the safe and responsible use of personal information on 
    the Internet. &nbsp;We will not knowingly collect, use, or disclose to third 
    parties any personal information collected from children, and have adopted 
    techniques to age-screen users on websites that might appeal to minors to 
    ensure compliance with this Privacy Policy, the Children's Online Privacy 
    Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), and other applicable laws.</p>
  
    <h2><a name="structure"></a>CHANGES IN CORPORATE STRUCTURE</h2>
  
    <p>In developing our business, we might sell certain assets, or the company, 
    or parts of it, may be sold, merged or otherwise transferred. &nbsp;In such 
    transactions, user information, whether personally identifiable or 
    otherwise, may be one of the transferred assets.</p>
    
    <h2>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
    
    <p>Under California Law SB 27, California residents are afforded expanded 
    rights to information about shared personal information, or are required to 
    have the free ability to opt-in or opt-out of such sharing. &nbsp;This 
    privacy policy fully affords you the rights not to have your personal 
    information shared by us. &nbsp;If you have any questions about your ability 
    to opt-out of information sharing by us, please see "How Can You Control
