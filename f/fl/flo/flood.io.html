<h2>Why we collect personal information</h2>
<p>
As an online business, it is necessary for us to collect personal information from our website users, including our Registered Users, and from other persons who contact us from time to time.

We may obtain personal information directly from third parties such as our sales agents and any of their representatives.

However, if it is reasonable and practicable to do so, we will collect personal information about an individual only from that individual.
