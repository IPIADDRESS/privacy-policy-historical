Our Privacy Policy is based on <i>Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents</i> Act, and <i>The Canadian Standards Association's Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information</i>. It also reflects our own belief about what is the right thing to do. We may update this Policy from time to time, so please check back if you are a regular visitor. Because of the nature of our website it is important that you read and understand the operation and use of our privacy policy and how it affects you.</p>

  <p><b>Website Visitors</b></p>
  <p>Like most website operators and iPhone App Flixel collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Flixel’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Flixel’s visitors use its website and iPhone App. From time to time, Flixel may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website and iPhone App.</p>
  <p>Flixel also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Flixel posts. Flixel only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>

  <p>Certain visitors to Flixel’s website and iPhone App to voluntarily interact with Flixel in ways that require Flixel to gather personally-identifying information.

In each case, Flixel collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Flixel. Flixel does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
