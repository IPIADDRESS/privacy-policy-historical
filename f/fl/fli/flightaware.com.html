<p>
Thank you for visiting FlightAware.  FlightAware is committed 
to honoring the privacy of our members and visitors.
</p>


<p>
 <strong>What information does FlightAware receive and how do we use it?</strong>
 </p><div class="indent">
   When you register for FlightAware and other FlightAware services, we ask you for your name,
   contact information, preferences, and personal profile information. This information lets us provide
   personalized services and communicate separately with you. We also use aggregated information about
   the use of our services to evaluate our users' preferences, improve our programming, and facilitate
   third-party reporting of Internet usage. 

  <p>
   Like most web sites, we use small bits of data called cookies stored on users' computers to simulate a
   continuous connection. Cookies let us "remember" information about your preferences and passwords and
   allow you to move within our service without reintroducing yourself. Recent versions of browsers let
   you easily see and control cookies. FlightAware and its advertisers may also use cookies to
   determine on an anonymous basis which advertisements users have seen and how users responded to them,
   but don't use such cookies to collect personally identifiable information unless you give us
   permission to do so.  Similarly, FlightAware and its advertisers may use small pieces of code
   called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect anonymous advertising metrics and to deliver cookies
   related to such advertisements. 
  </p>
 </div>
<p></p>

<p>
 <strong>May I choose what information I disclose?</strong>
 </p><div class="indent">
  While we need certain information to register you as a unique user and let you access personalized services,
  some contact and optional information is not required and may be given at your discretion.
 </div>
<p></p>

<p>
 <strong>What if I need to review or change the personal information I previously disclosed?</strong>
 </p><div class="indent">
  We encourage FlightAware members to update and edit their personal information and keep it current. You
  can easily correct or update your personal information at any time via our Profile page.
 </div>
<p></p>

<p>
 <strong>What kind of security is used to protect my information?</strong>
 </p><div class="indent">
  We store all user information in secure databases protected via a variety of access controls. This data is
  accessed only for the purposes specified in this privacy statement.
 </div>
<p></p>

<p>
 <strong>What information is made to other FlightAware users?</strong>
 </p><div class="indent">
  When contributing to the FlightAware public discussions, it is inherent in the form of communication that
  your unique user name is revealed to identify yourself.  All other information in your profile
  is optional, but will be displayed if you have entered such information and not specifically
  asked that it is not displayed.
 </div>
<p></p>

<p>
<strong>Who has access to my information?</strong>
 </p><div class="indent">
  We do not share personally identifiable data with other companies (apart from
  those acting as our agents in providing our service to you, who agree to use
  it only for that purpose), except as necessary to fulfill a transaction you
  have requested, or unless you otherwise give us permission to do so. FlightAware
  may also share such information in response to legal process, such as a court
  order or subpoena.
 </div>
<p></p>

<p>
 <strong>What about other companies featured on FlightAware?</strong>
 </p><div class="indent">
  We will not reveal any information about you to any company featured on
  FlightAware.  However, a featured company may define user criteria that they are interested
  in and by choosing to evaluate an advertisement, the featured company will know
  that you meet the defined criteria.
 </div>
<p></p>

<p>
 <strong>What about children's information?</strong>
 </p><div class="indent">
  Children under the age of thirteen years old may not register for FlightAware or use any FlightAware
  services that require personally identifiable information. 
 </div>
<p></p>

<p>
 <strong>What about the privacy issues with tracking private aircraft?</strong>
 </p><div class="indent">
  For that question, see <a href="/about/faq.rvt#privacy">the privacy section of our FAQ.</a>
 </div>
<p></p>

<p>
 <strong>Who can I contact if I have any questions regarding my privacy?</strong>
 </p><div class="indent">
