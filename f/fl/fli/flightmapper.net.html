<h1>Privacy policy</h1>

<div class="datepicker">

At FlightMapper.net, we recognize that privacy of your personal information is important.
<br><br> 
Here is information on what types of personal information we receive and collect when 
you use and visit FlightMapper.net. We never sell your personal information to third parties.

<br><br><h3>Log Files</h3>
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The 
information in the log files include 
your IP (internet protocol) address, 
the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), 
the time you visited our site and 
which pages you visited throughout our site.

<br><br><h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
We use third party advertisements on FlightMapper.net to support our site. Some of 
these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise 
on our site, which will also send these advertisers 
(such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP 
address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether 
you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes 
(showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain 
ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents 
cooking sites).

<br><br><h3>DoubleClick DART cookies</h3>
We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google's DoubleClick, which places a 
cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick 
advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve 
ads specific to you and your interests ("interest based targeting"). The ads served will 
be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been 
viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when 
viewing a non-related site). <br>
DART uses "non personally identifiable information". It does NOT track personal information 
about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social 
security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad 
serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting 
<a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx" rel="nofollow">
http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx
</a>
<br><br>
You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in 
your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet 
Security.

<br><br><h3>Google App Engine</h3>
Parts of the FlightMapper.net website are hosted on Google App Engine, thus the privacy
policy of Google App Engine also applies on this website. You can read the Google App Engine
privacy policy by visiting:
