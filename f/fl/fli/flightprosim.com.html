          OF HOW WE DEAL WITH INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE 
          OF 13.] </p>
        <p class="text">I. This notice is to inform you about the policies for 
          collection and use of personally identifiable information on the FlightProSim.com 
          site. Sites which are linked to our site may have different policies; 
          please review the privacy policy notices on those sites for details. 
        </p><p class="text">We do not collect personally identifiable information 
          about you on this site without your knowledge, and all such information 
          is collected directly from you. For example, we may ask you to provide 
          your e-mail address, name, mailing address, or other information about 
          yourself in order to participate in contests, chat rooms, or on bulletin 
          boards, to be added to the list to receive e-mail updates on particular 
          artists or types of music, to send so-called "postcards" or to conduct 
          transactions at The Store or elsewhere on the site. You are not required 
          to provide us with this information, but if you choose not to, you may 
          not be able to participate in some of the activities on this site. We 
          do not use cookies on this site but our advertisers, sponsors, and tracking 
          counters may. 
        </p><p class="text">We use the information we collect from you to allow you 
          to participate in the site activities for which the information is collected. 
          For example, when you give us your e-mail address in order to receive 
          updates on a particular artist or type of music, that address is added 
          to the e-mail list for that artist or type of music. On each e-mail 
          you receive, you are given the opportunity to unsubscribe; when you 
          unsubscribe, we remove your e-mail address permanently from that mailing 
          list. 
        </p><p class="text">For contests conducted on this site, we use the personal 
          information you provide only for the purpose of contacting you if you 
          win a prize and sending the prize to you. We do not use contact information 
          contained in contest entries to create mailing lists or for any other 
          purpose. For further information about how we handle entries to a particular 
          contest, please consult the contest rules. 
        </p><p class="text">We do not share personal information provided by site 
          visitors with anyone outside FlightProSim.com, except to the extent 
          necessary to allow you to participate in site activities (for example, 
          to send you a prize that you have won in a contest on the site). In 
          particular, we do not rent or sell mailing lists of site visitors to 
          any third party. 
        </p><p class="text">We try to keep the information we collect from you as 
          current as possible, and we take steps to maintain the security of your 
          personal information and to prevent unauthorized access to it by those 
          who do not have a legitimate need for it. We will never post your e-mail 
          address or other identifying information you have provided on our site 
          without your consent. 
        </p><p class="text">II. INFORMATION PRACTICES WITH REGARD TO CHILDREN 
        </p><p class="text">If you are under 13 years of age, you should not provide 
          any personally identifiable information on this site without the knowledge 
          and permission of your parent or guardian. If we learn that you are 
          under 13 years of age, we will not maintain or use any personally identifiable 
          information about you without the verifiable consent of your parent 
          or guardian, except as allowed by law. This may mean that you will be 
          unable to participate in some activities on the site without that verifiable 
          consent. 
        </p><p class="text">We collect personally identifiable information directly 
          from visitors on this site who may be under the age of 13. We do not 
          collect this information without the knowledge of the visitor. 
        </p><p class="text">Our activities on this site are carried out in compliance 
          with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Under that 
          Act, we may not ask a child to provide more personal information than 
          is reasonably necessary in order to participate in an activity on this 
          site. We comply with this requirement, and any personally identifiable 
          information collected from a visitor on this site is used only for the 
          purpose of enabling the visitor's participation in activities on this 
          site. 
        </p><p class="text">For example, we ask visitors who wish to be placed on 
          a specific mailing list for a newsletter to provide an e-mail address. 
          This information is used to send the visitor the newsletter requested. 
          We also ask visitors who wish to receive a free promotional item (such 
          as a CD, t-shirt, etc.) to provide name, mailing address, and e-mail 
          address. The name and mailing address are used to send the visitor the 
          promotional item. The e-mail address is used only if we need to contact 
          the visitor to verify name and mailing address. We do not retain this 
          information after the item has been delivered, and we do not use it 
          for any other purpose. 
        </p><p class="text">For contests that are held on this site, we ask each contestant 
          to provide year of birth, as well as name, address, and e-mail address. 
          If the year provided indicates that the contestant may not be at least 
          13 years old, the information submitted is deleted. Information submitted 
          in order to participate in a contest is not used for any other purpose. 
          Please refer to the specific age requirements for each contest as rules 
          may vary from contest to contest. 
        </p><p class="text">We ask each visitor who wishes to participate in chat 
          rooms and bulletin boards on this site to provide an e-mail address 
          along with the visitor's screen name. Each visitor who wishes to send 
          a so-called "postcard" is asked to provide the visitor's screen name 
          and e-mail address, the recipient's name and e-mail address, and a message 
          selected by the visitor. All such e-mail addresses are used only to 
          protect the security and integrity of the site, such as to take action 
          against visitors who post inappropriate material or harass other visitors. 
        </p><p class="text">Some of the activities on our site (e.g., certain chat 
          rooms and bulletin boards), require participants to be 13 years of age 
          or older. When you sign up for any of these activities, we will ask 
          you to enter your date of birth. This information will not be used, 
          stored, or published for any purposes other than to ensure the compliance 
          of such age restrictions with respect to those age restricted activities. 
        </p><p class="text">In some circumstances, we also ask visitors to this site 
          to provide us with contact information on their parent or guardian. 
          We use this information only for the purpose of contacting the parent 
          or guardian to notify them of our information practices with respect 
          to children, to notify that person of a child's participation on this 
          site, and/or to seek the consent of the parent or guardian to such participation. 
        </p><p class="text">The parent or guardian of any person under the age of 
          13 whose personal information we have collected on this site may ask 
          to review that personal information, to have it deleted, and to forbid 
          further collection of the information. For more information on how to 
          do this, please contact the contact person listed below. 
        </p><p class="text">No personal information collected on this site is shared 
          with third parties other than a parent or guardian of a site visitor, 
          except that information may be shared with those with whom we contract 
          to carry out the internal operations of the site (for example, to send 
          you a promotional item that you have requested on the site.). These 
          contractors have agreed with us to use personal information of site 
          visitors only for the purposes of carrying out these operations. In 
          particular, we do not rent or sell mailing lists of site visitors to 
          any third party.
