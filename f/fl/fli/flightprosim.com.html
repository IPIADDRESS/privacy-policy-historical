          yourself in order to participate in contests, chat rooms, or on bulletin 
          boards, to be added to the list to receive e-mail updates on particular

          transactions at The Store or elsewhere on the site. You are not required 
          to provide us with this information, but if you choose not to, you may 
          not be able to participate in some of the activities on this site. We

          to participate in the site activities for which the information is collected. 
          For example, when you give us your e-mail address in order to receive 
          updates, that address is added 
          to the e-mail list for that area. On each e-mail 
          you receive, you are given the opportunity to unsubscribe; when you 
          unsubscribe, we remove your e-mail address permanently from that mailing

          contained in contest entries to create mailing lists or for any other

          to send you a prize that you have won in a contest on the site). In 
          particular, we do not rent or sell mailing lists of site visitors to

When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

        <p class="faqtxt">Users are responsible for securing the confidentiality of their password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under their password or account. It is strongly recommended that users take extra precautions when receiving files from unfamiliar third parties (i.e., via email), as they may be harmful.</p>
        <p class="faqtxt">A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If you reject the cookie, you may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that you will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, you may not be able to participate in some of our Sweepstakes, Contests or monthly Drawings that may take place.

        </span>
        </p><p class="text"><span class="faqtxt">If you are under 13 years of age, you should not provide 
          any personally identifiable information on this site without the knowledge 
          and permission of your parent or guardian. If we learn that you are 
          under 13 years of age, we will not maintain or use any personally identifiable 
          information about you without the verifiable consent of your parent 
          or guardian, except as allowed by law. This may mean that you will be 
          unable to participate in some activities on the site without that verifiable 
          consent. 
        </span>
        </p><p class="text"><span class="faqtxt">We collect personally identifiable information directly 
          from visitors on this site who may be under the age of 13. We do not 
          collect this information without the knowledge of the visitor. 
        </span>
        </p><p class="text"><span class="faqtxt">Our activities on this site are carried out in compliance 
          with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Under that 
          Act, we may not ask a child to provide more personal information than 
          is reasonably necessary in order to participate in an activity on this 
          site. We comply with this requirement, and any personally identifiable 
          information collected from a visitor on this site is used only for the 
          purpose of enabling the visitor's participation in activities on this 
          site. 
        </span>
        </p><p class="text"><span class="faqtxt">For example, we ask visitors who wish to be placed on 
          a specific mailing list for a newsletter to provide an e-mail address. 
          This information is used to send the visitor the newsletter requested. 
          We also ask visitors who wish to receive a free promotional item (such 
          as a CD, t-shirt, etc.) to provide name, mailing address, and e-mail 
          address. The name and mailing address are used to send the visitor the 
          promotional item. The e-mail address is used only if we need to contact 
          the visitor to verify name and mailing address. We do not retain this 
          information after the item has been delivered, and we do not use it 
          for any other purpose. 
        </span>
        </p><p class="text"><span class="faqtxt">For contests that are held on this site, we ask each contestant 
          to provide year of birth, as well as name, address, and e-mail address. 
          If the year provided indicates that the contestant may not be at least 
          13 years old, the information submitted is deleted. Information submitted 
          in order to participate in a contest is not used for any other purpose. 
          Please refer to the specific age requirements for each contest as rules 
          may vary from contest to contest. 
        </span>
        </p><p class="text"><span class="faqtxt">We ask each visitor who wishes to participate in chat 
          rooms and bulletin boards on this site to provide an e-mail address 
          along with the visitor's screen name. Each visitor who wishes to send 
          a so-called "postcard" is asked to provide the visitor's screen name 
          and e-mail address, the recipient's name and e-mail address, and a message 
          selected by the visitor. All such e-mail addresses are used only to 
          protect the security and integrity of the site, such as to take action 
          against visitors who post inappropriate material or harass other visitors. </span>
        </p><p class="text"><span class="faqtxt">Some of the activities on our site (e.g., certain chat

          you to enter your date of birth. This information will not be used,

          of such age restrictions with respect to those age restricted activities.

          to provide us with contact information on their parent or guardian. 
          We use this information only for the purpose of contacting the parent 
          or guardian to notify them of our information practices with respect 
          to children, to notify that person of a child's participation on this 
          site, and/or to seek the consent of the parent or guardian to such participation.

          further collection of the information. For more information on how to 
          do this, please contact the contact person listed below.
