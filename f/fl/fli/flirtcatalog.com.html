                      <span class="style9">How Does FlirtCatalog.com Use My  Information?</span></p>
              <p><br>
                      <strong>Personal  Information.</strong> We use  Personal Information primarily for our own internal purposes, such as  providing, maintaining, evaluating, and improving the FlirtCatalog.com Services  and the Website, fulfilling requests for information, producing and shipping  the products that you order, and providing customer support.

              <p><br>
                      <strong>Disclosure to  Successors.</strong> We may  disclose your Personal Information to any successor-in-interest of ours, such  as a company that acquires us. In the event FlirtCatalog.com goes through a  business transition, such as a merger or acquisition by or with another  company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information  will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email or  by a notice on our Website of any such change in ownership or control of your  Personal Information.</p>
              <p><br>
                      <strong>Disclosure to  Unaffiliated Third Parties.</strong> We may disclose your Personal Information to prevent an emergency, to prevent  harm to others, to respond to legal requirements, to protect or enforce our  rights and policies, to protect or enforce the rights of a third party, or as  required or permitted by law (including, without limitation, to comply with a  subpoena or court order). In particular, if you are an Affiliate, we may  disclose your information to a third party that alleges that you have infringed  their intellectual property rights through the products sold through your website  or web space. Similarly, if you allege that an Affiliate is infringing upon your  intellectual property rights, we may disclose your information to that Affiliate.</p>
              <p><br>
                      <strong>Disclosure to  Third Party Service Providers and Online Partners.</strong> We may contract with various third  parties who help us provide, maintain and improve the Website and the FlirtCatalog.com  Services. For example, we use a third party to process payments made to us, and  may subcontract out production, fulfillment, analytics, reporting or other  operations. We also contract with several online partners to help manage,  monitor and optimize our Website and the FlirtCatalog.com Services and to help  us measure the effectiveness of our advertising, communications and how  visitors use the Website. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to  prevent such third parties from disclosing your Personal Information, except  for the purpose of providing the services in question. We cannot guarantee that  such third parties will not disclose your Personal Information.</p>
              <p><br>
                      <strong>Disclosure of  Non-Personal Information.</strong> We will disclose Non-Personal Information, in aggregate form, to potential  strategic partners, advertisers, investors, customers, and others. You may not  opt-out of the sharing of this information. However, it cannot be easily used  to identify you personally.</p>

                      <span class="style9">What About Cookies and Web Beacons?</span><br>
                A cookie is a small file placed on the  hard drive of your computer. Most websites use cookies. We use cookies to track  your use of the Website and the FlirtCatalog.com Services, provide you with a  more personalized user experience, and to allow you to login and begin use of  the FlirtCatalog.com Services automatically when you visit the Website.<br>
                A web beacon is an often-transparent  graphic image, usually no larger than a 1x1 pixel that is placed on a web page  or in an e-mail that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the  Website or receiving the e-mail.<br>
                Cookies and web beacons used by FlirtCatalog.com  and our online partners are not linked to Personal Information. Some of our Affiliates  may use cookies or web beacons on our Website. We have no access to or control  over these cookies and web beacons. This Privacy Policy covers the use of  cookies and web beacons by FlirtCatalog.com and our online partners only and  does not cover the use of cookies or web beacons by any other third party,  Affiliate or advertiser.</p>

                      <span class="style9">Does FlirtCatalog.com Protect My Personal  Information?</span></p>
              <p><br>
                      <strong>Personal  Information.</strong> Whenever we  obtain your Personal Information, we use commercially reasonable efforts to  protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, we are not insurers  of the security of your Personal Information. Accordingly, we assume no  liability for any disclosure of data due to errors in transmission,  unauthorized third party access or other acts of third parties, or acts or  omissions beyond our reasonable control.</p>
              <p><br>
                      <strong>Website Content.</strong> The content that you store, post, or  transmit on or through the Website, such as message board postings, storefront  pages, and images on your Products, may be accessed by other users, including  people that you do not know. We are not responsible for the actions of others.  Therefore, you should use care in communicating with other users and only  disclose your Personal Information to other users that you know to be  trustworthy. You should not assume that your content will be kept private.</p>
              <p><br>
                      <span class="style9">How Can I Review and Make Changes to My  Personal Information?</span><br>
                You can obtain a copy of and request that  we correct errors in your Personal Information by emailing us at <u><a href="mailto:Privacy@FlirtCatalog.com">Privacy@FlirtCatalog.com</a></u>. For your protection, you will be  required to provide proof of your identity to obtain a copy of your Personal  Information.

              <p><br>
                      <strong>Security</strong><br>
                The security of your Personal Information  is important to us. When you enter sensitive information such as a credit card  number and/or social security number on our registration or order forms, we  encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).<br>
                We follow generally accepted industry  standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during  transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over  the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while  we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal  Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
              <p><br>
                      <span class="style9">Does This Privacy Policy Apply When I  Access Third Party Websites?</span><br>
                You may be able to access third party  websites directly from the Website. This Privacy Policy does not apply when you  access third party websites. We cannot control how third parties may use  Personal Information you disclose to them, so you should carefully review the  privacy policy of any third party website you visit before using it or  disclosing your Personal Information to its provider.</p>
