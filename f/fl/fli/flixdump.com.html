</p><p>THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THE WEBSITE COLLECTS 

</p><p>The Website generally collects personally identifying information with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey, make a purchase, subscribe to our publication(s), or register for any portion of our services, you are asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name or phone number. Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested.

</p><p>HOW THE WEBSITE USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU

For example, if you subscribe to any of our publications, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your mailing address to send you the publication. Similarly, if you enter an online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner. We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products or services, or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs. 

</p><p>We may share e-mail addresses and sell or share all other information with our affiliates and with carefully selected companies who we think can offer you services and products of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive future commercial communications from us by e-mail, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the e-mail. 

</p><p>While your individual information is protected as outlined above, we reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share anonymous and personal data about our users for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners. 

</p><p>If you register using an AOL, GMail, Yahoo, or Hotmail account, you authorize us to send your contacts an anonymous email upon registration on your behalf requesting them to become a member.

</p><p>COOKIES 

</p><p>You may have read about "cookies," nuggets of information that are placed by a Website in a storage place on your own computer. We may use cookies to control the display of ads, to track usage patterns on the site, to deliver dynamic content, and to record registration and personalization information. For example, if you register on any part of the Website and are given the option to save your user name and password on your computer, we can provide this convenience to you by placing a cookie on your computer. Our cookies may contain personally identifiable information and such cookies may be shared with our affiliates and other companies. 

</p><p>Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.
