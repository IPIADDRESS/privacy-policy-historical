	<h1>Flixster's Privacy Policy</h1>

	<h3>Effective September 4, 2008</h3>
	
	<p>Click <a href="/misc/privacy?version=1">here</a> to see previous versions of our Privacy Policy.</p>

	<h3>Our Commitment to You</h3>

	<p>Welcome to Flixster! Flixster is an online community for movie fans made available through <a href="/">www.flixster.com</a> (the 
	<b>"Site"</b>) where users can setup a profile with all of their movie ratings, favorites, lists and more, connect their profile with friends and meet 
	new people with similar taste (collectively, the <b>"Service"</b>).  Flixster takes your privacy very seriously.  To make it easier for you to read and 
	understand our Privacy Policy, we did the unconventional thing - we wrote this in plain English and tried to keep it to a reasonably length.  This 
	Privacy Policy applies only to information that users provide to us through the Service.</p>

	Here are our privacy principles:
	<ul>
		<li>Providing information to us is your choice.</li>
		<li>You can end your membership at any time (See our <a href="/misc/terms">Terms of Service</a> to find out how easy it is).</li>
		<li>You always have the ability to opt-out of receiving communications from us.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical 
	or other analysis and using or touching information in any way, including collecting, storing, disclosing and transferring information within the United 
	States or internationally.</p>

	<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

	<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Service, features and content, to administer your membership and to enable 
	you to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.</p>
	
	<h4>Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
	
	<ul>
		<li>In the course of using the Service, we ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or 
		identify you and administer your account (<b>"Personal Information"</b>).  Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone 
		number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses.</li>
		
		<li>We also collect the other information that you provide, for example, as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your 
		profile page (e.g., other information such as your zip code, age, gender and individual preferences) (<b>"Non-Identifying Information"</b>).</li>
		
		<li>We use your Non-Identifying Information (in some cases, along with your Personal Information) mainly to provide the Service and administer your 
		inquiries.</li>
		
		<li>We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Flixster Users 
		(defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality of the Service and to analyze and understand how our 
		Service is used.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Log Data</h4>
	
	<p>As you use the Service, whether as a member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a <b>"Flixster User"</b>), our servers automatically 
	record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (<b>"Log Data"</b>).  Log Data may include, but is not limited to, your computer's 
	Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to the Site and information you search for on a Site. We use 
	this information to monitor and analyze use of the Service and for the Site's technical administration, to increase our Site's functionality and 
	user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs.  For example, some of this information is collected so that when you use the Service 
	again, we will recognize and remember you and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests.</p>

	<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

	<h4>Members</h4>
	<p>We will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere through the Service according to the preferences you set in your account.  
	Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want other Flixster Users to know about you.  We recommend that you guard your 
	anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile 
	pages. You can review and revise your profile information at any time.</p> 

	<h4>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</h4>
	<p>We may share aggregated information that includes your Personal Information, Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry 
	analysis and demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services.</p>
	
	<h4>Service Providers</h4>
	<p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related services 
	(e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site's features) or to assist us in analyzing 
	how the Service is used.  These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not 
	to disclose or use it for any other purpose. We may also provide Personal Information to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose 
	of providing you with information on goods or services we believe will be of interest to you.  You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such 
	communications. (See <b>"Email Policies,"</b> below.)</p>
	
	<h4>Third Party Social Networking Services</h4>
	<p>You may have the opportunity to access or interact with the Service via other social networking websites and services (<b>"SNSs"</b>) like Facebook and 
	MySpace.  Consequently, your Personal Information may be shared with those SNSs.  In the event that you choose to provide your information directly to a 
	third party SNSs, your information will be governed by the policies of those other SNSs.  We don't exercise control over third party SNSs.  These other 
	services may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, solicit Personal Information from you and follow different rules regarding the use 
	of the information you submit to them.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>
	
	<h4>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h4>
	<p>Flixster cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.  We will disclose any 
	information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to 
	respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Flixster or a third party, to 
	protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>
	
	<h4>Business Transfers</h4>
	<p>Flixster may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, 
	acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.</p> 

	<h3>Email Policies</h3>
	
	<p>We use your Personal Information to send you weekly updates on various Site information (including new movies or quizzes of the week), a variety of 
	transactional emails (such as when users post comments to your profile page) and the occasional site announcement. Members who agree to the terms and 
	conditions of the Flixster Terms of Service Agreement are given the opportunity to opt in to receiving such communications from us in the future. You 
	have full control regarding which of these emails you want to receive.  If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications 
	from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your account settings by simply clicking "My Account" 
	at the top right corner of any page.</p>

	<h3>Inviting Friends to Flixster</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Flixster is intended to be a place to share movie ratings, reviews and more with friends. We hope you will like the Service and invite others to 
		join you!</li>
		
		<li>Inviting friends to Flixster is always completely optional. When you choose to invite friends, we will send an email to the addresses you enter 
		indicating that it is a message from you.  We will share your name and email address with anyone you invite so that they know you suggested that we 
		send the invitation.  If a friend doesn't respond to the initial invitation after a little while, we will send a single reminder message on your 
		behalf.</li>
		
		<li>For your convenience, Flixster offers the ability to import email addresses from common address books such as Hotmail/Yahoo/Gmail/AOL.  If you 
		choose to use this feature, we will access your address book using the login details that you provide. We access your address book only once to 
		retrieve your friends' information so that you may select whom to invite. We don't store your login details nor do we use them for any other purpose 
		than to retrieve your contacts. We never send invitations to contacts you don't explicitly select and your invitations are the only emails we will 
		ever send to your friends unless they separately register to join the Site.</li>
		
		<li>If you have accidentally selected friends to receive invitations whom you did not intend - please contact us and we can cancel the reminder 
		message.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h3>

	<p>All members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their profile by simply clicking "My Account" at the top right corner 
	of any page.  If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated.  If you would like us to delete your record in 
	our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request if we do not have any legal obligation to retain the record.  See below 
	for privacy contact information.</p>

	<h3>Our Policy Toward Children</h3>

	<p>The Service is not directed to children under 13.  We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.   If a 
	parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us 
	using the links at the bottom of the page.  If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such 
	information from our files.</p>

	<h3>Use of Cookies</h3>

	<p>Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information.  A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for 
	record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies for two purposes.  First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login ID and login password for future 
	logins to the Site.  Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site 
	and to monitor aggregate usage by Flixster Users and web traffic routing on the Site.  Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your 
	computer when you log off from the Site and Service and then close your browser.  Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on 
	your browser.  You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the 
	websites you visit.  If you don't accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service.</p>

	<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>

	<p>Our Site contains links to other websites.  If you choose to visit an advertiser by "clicking on" a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or 
	click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website.  The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement or 
	representation of our affiliation with that website. This also doesn't mean that we endorse that website's privacy or information security policies or 
	practices.  We don't exercise control over third party websites.  These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, 
	collect data or solicit Personal Information from you.  Other sites follow different rules regarding the use of the information you submit to them.  We 
	encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>

	<h3>Security</h3>

	<p>The security of your Personal Information, among other things, depends on your protection of your account password. Please don't disclose your 
	account password to anyone.  Flixster uses industry standard technology designed to help keep your Personal Information safe.  Your information may be 
	transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state or country where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those where 
	you live.  If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please be aware that Flixster transfers Personal 
	Information to the United States and processes it there.  Your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
	
	<p>If you have any other questions about the security of our Service, please contact us using the links at the bottom of the page.</p>

	<h3>Changes in Privacy Policy</h3>

	<p>From time to time we may update this Privacy Policy.  We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site.  Your 
	continued usage of Flixster constitutes an acceptance of the then-current Privacy Policy and Terms of Service so we encourage you to visit this page 
	periodically to review any changes.</p>

	<h3>Phishing</h3>

	<p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Flixster.  Safeguarding information to help protect you from 
	identity theft is a top priority.  We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or 
	national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.  For more information about phishing, you can visit 
	the Federal Trade Commission's website.</p>

	<h3>Contact</h3>

	<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this Site or your dealings with the Service, you can contact us via the links 
	at the bottom of every page, or by writing to:</p>
