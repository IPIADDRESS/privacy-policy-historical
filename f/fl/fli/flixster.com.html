	<p><a href="http://community.flixster.com/misc/copyrightprivacyterms?ver_ppol=20100910&amp;tab=privacy">September 9, 2010</a></p>

	<p>
		Thank you for visiting Flixster, including Rotten Tomatoes (together with the other 
		<a href="http://www.warnerbros.com/main/privacy/privacy_list.html" target="_blank">Warner Bros. Entertainment Group</a>
		companies, "we" "us", or "our"). Your privacy is important
		to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our
		information practices and the choices you can make about the collection and use
		of the personal information you submit on Web pages or for services where this
		policy is posted. If you also have
		downloaded the Flixster Collections software, please read the Additional
		Privacy Disclosures for Flixster Collections Software to learn more about the
		additional information collection practices that are specific to that offering.
	</p>

	<h3>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

	<p>
		<b>Registration.</b> At some of our Web
		sites, applications and services ("Services"), you can order products or
		purchase content, enter contests, play one of our games, read critic and user
		reviews, vote in polls, rate movies, TV shows and other content, or otherwise
		express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online
		newsletters, or participate in our online forums or communities. In the course
		of using the Services, we ask you to create an account by providing us with
		certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or
		identify you, as well as to administer your account. The types of personally identifiable
		information that may be collected include: name, address, e-mail address,
		telephone number, fax number, credit card and billing information, and
		information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and
		services.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Information about others/inviting friends.</b> You also can
		submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's
		name and e-mail address to share content or recommendations, and if you order a
		gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the
		recipient's name and address. The types of personally identifiable information
		that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's
		name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some of our Services also
		allow you to invite your friends to join our services and to connect with you through
		social media features. Inviting friends
		is always optional. To do so, you may provide
		their contact information or may enter your log-in credentials to import email
		addresses from your address book from other sites that support such
		functionality (e.g., Yahoo! and Gmail). You select the friends you want to invite to share in this
		experience.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Information from	other sources/social networking sites.</b> You can also engage with our content,
		such as video, games, applications, and other offerings, on or through (1)
		third-party social networking sites, such as Facebook, (2) third-party social media plug-ins and
		applications, and (3) our social media plug-ins and
		applications that may be available through third-party sites or our Services. You may also choose to link your account with us to third party social networking
		sites. When you link your account or engage with our content on
		or through third party social networking sites, social media plug-ins or
		applications, you may allow us to have ongoing access to certain information from your social media profile (e.g., name, e-mail address, photo,
		gender, birthday, location, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who
		follow you, the posts or the 'likes' you make). We may also maintain non-personally identifiable information (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on, etc.) from your
		interaction with our content.
	</p>

	<p>
		When you provide information from your social media
		profile, it can help enable
		us to do things like (1) give you exclusive content, (2) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our applications or
		websites, and (3) contact you through the social networking sites or directly
		with the latest news, special offerings, and rewards. By doing so,
		you consent to the use of this information in accordance with this Privacy
		Policy.
	</p>

	<p>
		When you post information on blogs, public forums or similar functions at our Services, or when you interact with our Services through social networking sites (depending on your privacy settings), social media plug-ins or similar applications, this information could be seen by anyone on the Internet. Therefore, we cannot prevent further use of this information.  You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social networking sites. For more information about how you can customize your privacy settings and how social networking sites handle your personal information, please refer to their privacy help guides, privacy policies and terms of use.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Instant Personalization on Rotten Tomatoes</b>.  At
		some of our Services, we enable a feature that allows you to instantly
		personalize your experience using Facebook's Instant Personalization. Instant Personalization
		lets you bring your friends and movie interests with you as you explore our
		Services where we have this feature enabled. To use this feature, you must have a
		Facebook account, be signed in, and ensure Instant Personalization is turned on
		in your Facebook privacy settings. Once
		enabled, Instant Personalization will provide the Service using this
		feature with the public information you make available from your <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=17437">Facebook
		account</a>. For example, you may see your first name,
		profile picture, and your friends' reviews the next time you access Rotten
		Tomatoes.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can turn off
		Instant Personalization at any time by going to the privacy settings of your
		Facebook account and disabling the feature or by logging out on the Rotten
		Tomatoes site. To learn more about Facebook's Instant Personalization, click <a href="http://www.facebook.com/instantpersonalization/">here.</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Information collection
		from mobile devices</b>. If you access our
		Services on your mobile telephone or other mobile device, we also collect your
		unique device identifier and may collect location information. We also may collect your telephone number and
		other information you choose to provide, such as username or e-mail address (e.g.,
		to receive updates about movies and other content).
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Technical and usage information.</b> We also may obtain certain technical
		information when you use our Services, such as the type of browser you are
		using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are
		using (e.g., Windows 7, Mac OS, iOS, and Android), and the name of your
		Internet service provider or mobile carrier.&nbsp;	
	</p>

	<h3>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION</h3>

	<p>
		We use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our
		products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our
		offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we
		believe may be of interest to you.
	</p>

	<p>
		We use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you
		have won one of our contests or when we make changes to our user agreements, to
		fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, to confirm purchases you
		have made through our Services, or to contact you about your account with us.
	</p>

	<p>
		We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them
		your invitations, gifts or offers. From time to time, we also may use this
		information to offer our products, programs, or services to them.
	</p>

	<p>
		The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is
		used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to
		facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time
		to time, to offer you products, programs, or services.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you choose to submit content for publication, we may publish your screen name
		and other information you have provided to us.

		entertainment news and updates; get information about movies or TV shows (e.g.,
		find show times for theaters near you); buy movie tickets; play games; follow
		blogs; and read critic and user reviews. We may also use this information
		to offer you products and services we believe may be of interest to you and
		otherwise tailor your experience.
	</p>

	<p>
		We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the
		design and content of our Services and to enable us to personalize your
		experience with our Services. We also may use this information in the aggregate
		to analyze usage of our Services, as well as for us and for other partners to
		offer you products, programs, or services.
	</p>

	<h3>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE </h3>

	<p>
		We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process,
		for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose
		such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request or where we
		believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding
		illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to
		the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as
		otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer information about you
		if we or one of our business units are acquired by, sold to, or merged with
		another company. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Our agents and contractors may have access to personally identifiable information to
		help carry out the services they are performing for us.
	</p>

	<p>
		Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of
		information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that
		we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this
		Privacy Policy.
	</p>

	<p>
		We may disclose personally identifiable information about you to companies whose
		practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., other marketers,
		publishers, retailers, participatory databases and non-profit organizations)
		that want to directly market products or services to you. If we share
		personally identifiable information with such companies, we will provide you
		with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses. If at some point in the future you decide
		that you no longer want us to share your information for these purposes, send
		us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@flixster-inc.com">privacy@flixster-inc.com</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		We may, on occasion, combine information we receive from you with outside records
		to enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that may be
		of interest to you. We provide you with an opportunity to express your
		preferences with respect to receiving information about products and services
		from us and selected third parties when you interact with us. If you ever
		decide in the future that you would like to update these preferences, you may
		log into your account if you have created one with us, you can follow the "unsubscribe" instructions provided on any
		marketing e-mail you receive from us, or you may send us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@flixster-inc.com">privacy@flixster-inc.com</a> and we will
		edit your preferences accordingly.
	</p>

	<h3 id="thirdparty">COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTY SITES, AD SERVERS, AND SPONSORS</h3>

	<p>
		Some of our Services contain links to or integrations with other sites (e.g., Facebook,
		Twitter) whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors
		should consult the other sites' or services' privacy policies before submitting
		any information, as we have no control over information that is submitted to,
		or collected by, these third parties.
	</p>

	<p>
		We sometimes may offer content or programs (e.g., contests, sweepstakes,
		promotions, games, applications or social network integrations) that are
		sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these
		relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information
		that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the activity. We have no
		control over these third parties' use of this information. Our Services will notify you at the time of
		requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will
		obtain such information.
	</p>

	<p>
		At some of our Services, reputable third parties may present or serve the
		advertisements, provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response
		measurement, site analytics, as well as assist
		with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third
		parties may view, edit, or set their own cookies. The use of these technologies
		by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not
		covered by this privacy statement. For more information about third party ad
		servers at our Services and your ability to opt-out of targeted advertising
		from such third parties, visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNICAL INFORMATION</h3>

	<p>
		We, our third party service providers, and our partners may send
		"cookies" to your computer or use similar technologies to enhance
		your experience with our Services. "Cookies" are files that can
		identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well
		as technical information (including click through and click stream data).
		Cookies manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or
		delivered by or through us and/or other networks or sites. Cookies can either
		be permanent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or
		temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser).
	</p>

	<p>
		Some of our Services may use locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as "Flash cookies")
		to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation.
		Adobe's Flash player (and similar applications) use this technology to remember
		settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. Flash cookies are not managed through your
		web browser, but you can access your Flash management tools from <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">Adobe's website</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		We may also use "Web beacons" that monitor your use of our Services. Web
		beacons (or Web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a method for
		delivering a graphic image on a Web page for the purpose of transferring data,
		such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the
		page on which the Web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the
		page on which the Web beacon appears, the time the page containing the Web
		beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon and the
		identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that
		server.
	</p>

	<p>
		When we correspond with you via HTML capable e-mail, Web beacons let us know whether
		you received and opened our e-mail. On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not
		contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if you
		choose to furnish personally identifiable information, this information can be
		linked to the data stored in the cookies/Web beacons.
	</p>

	<p>
		By accepting this Privacy Policy, you specifically agree to our use of cookies and
		Web beacons as described herein. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies
		from us or from any other Web site. Additionally, by setting your Web browser
		to display HTML e-mails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of
		some Web beacons. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser
		for more information. However, certain areas of our Services can only be
		accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware
		that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some
		of our content.
	</p>

	<h3>OUR COMMITMENT TO SECURITY</h3>

		We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures
		to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and
		correctly use the information we collect online.

		To access the personally identifiable information that our Services collected
		about you online from the pages on which this Privacy Policy is posted, to
		correct factual errors in such information, or to update your interests,
		preferences or other portions of your user profile, please log into your
		profile if you have created one with us or send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@flixster-inc.com">privacy@flixster-inc.com</a>.

		functionality, from the options/settings menu on your device. Methods for
		uninstalling will vary depending on your device.&nbsp; To uninstall one of our

		in the United States, your personal data will be processed by us in the U.S.
		where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of
		protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you
		create a user account at our Services as a visitor from outside the United
		States, you consent to the collection and/or processing of your personally
		identifiable information in the United States, which includes the use of
		cookies as described above.
	</p>

	<h3>NOTIFICATION REGARDING UPDATES</h3>
