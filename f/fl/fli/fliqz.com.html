          others who use www.fliqz.com and any other web sites or services owned 
          or operated by Fliqz (the "Fliqz Sites") (collectively or individually, 
          "Users"). </p>
        <p>This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the Fliqz 
          <a class="white" href="terms.htm"> Terms 
          of Use</a>. Your use of the Fliqz Sites and any personal information 
          you provide on the Fliqz Sites remains subject to the terms of this 
          Privacy Notice and our <a class="white" href="terms.htm">Terms 
          of Use</a>. </p>
        <p>Please note that any video, image, blog entry, or other content posted 
          at the direction of Users onto the Fliqz Sites becomes publicly-available 
          content, is not considered personally identifiable information subject 
          to this Privacy Notice, and may be collected and used by others.</p>
        <p>NOTE TO KIDS: THE FLIQZ SITES ARE NOT FOR PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 
          13. <u>If you are under 13 years of age, please visit another site - 
          there are lots of other great web sites for you.</u></p>
        <p><u>The Information Fliqz Collects: </u> </p>
        <ul>
          <li> User Provided Information: You may provide to Fliqz what is generally 
            called "personally identifiable" information (such as your name and 
            email address) when you choose to participate in the various activities 
            offered on the Fliqz Sites such as uploading videos, posting messages 
            and blogging, reviewing and rating videos, entering surveys and contests, 
            and subscribing to newsletters. 
          </li><li> "Cookies" Information: When you visit the Fliqz Sites, we may send 
            one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric 
            characters - to your computer. Fliqz uses both session cookies and 
            persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your 
            browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser 
            and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Fliqz 
            Sites. Persistent cookies can be removed, but each web browser is 
            a little different, so please look through your browser "Help" file 
            to learn the correct way to modify your cookies set-up. 
          </li><li> "Automatically Collected" Information: When you visit the Fliqz 
            Sites or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record 
            certain information from your web browser by using different types 
            of technology, including "clear gifs" or "web beacons". This "automatically 
            collected" information may include your Internet Protocol address 
            ("IP Address"), web browser type, the web pages or sites that you 
            visit just before or just after the Fliqz Sites, the pages you view 
            on our site, and the dates and times that you visit the Fliqz Sites. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><u>The Way Fliqz Uses Information: </u> </p>
        <ol>
          <li> Fliqz uses the information that we collect to operate, maintain, 
            enhance, and provide to you all of the features and services found 
            on the Fliqz Sites. We will use your email address, without further 
            consent, for administrative purposes such as notifying you of major 
            Fliqz Sites updates, for customer service, or to contact you regarding 
            a video that you have posted. 
          </li><li> Fliqz uses all of the information that we collect to understand 
            the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way 
            the Fliqz Sites work and look, and to create new features and functionality. 
          </li><li> Fliqz uses "automatically collected" information and "cookies" 
            information to: (a) remember your information so that you will not 
            have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the 
            Fliqz Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized advertisements, content, 
            and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; 
            (d) monitor aggregate usage metrics such as total number of visitors 
            and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status 
            in any promotions, sweepstakes, and contests that we might host. 
          </li><li> Fliqz will not use your email address or other personally identifiable 
            information to send promotional or marketing messages without your 
            consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which 
            you will have the ability to opt-in. </li>
        </ol>
        <p><u>When Fliqz Discloses Information:</u> </p>
        <ul>
          <li> <b>Fliqz does not share your personally identifiable information 
            with other organizations for their <i>marketing</i> or <i>promotional</i> 
            uses without your express consent.</b> 
          </li><li> To provide web site hosting, maintenance and security, fulfill 
            orders, offer certain functionality, improve our site, and to create 
            new site features, we may disclose User information to affiliated 
            companies or other businesses or persons. We require that these parties 
            process such information in compliance with this Privacy Notice, we 
            authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these 
            parties to use appropriate confidentiality measures. 
          </li><li> Fliqz may share automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable 
            information with interested third parties to assist them in understanding 
            the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, 
            promotions, and/or functionality on the Fliqz Sites. 
          </li><li> Fliqz may disclose User information if required to do so by law, 
            or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply 
            with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond 
            to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant. 
            We may make such disclosures without providing Users notice, in some 
            cases. 
          </li><li> Fliqz reserves the right to disclose User information that is necessary 
            to enforce our <a class="white" href="terms.htm">Terms 
            of Use</a>; take precautions against liability; protect Users from 
            fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves 
            against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement 
            agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Fliqz Sites; 
            and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Fliqz, 
            our members, or others. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><u>Your Choices: </u> </p>
        <p>You may, of course, decline to share personally identifiable information 
          with Fliqz, in which case you will not be able to upload videos or media 
          to the Fliqz Sites. You may update, correct, or delete your member information 
          and email subscription preferences at any time by going to the account 
          section of the Fliqz Sites. </p>
        <p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify 
          your identity before granting you account access or making corrections. 
          YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD 
          AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES. </p>
        <p><u>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites: </u> </p>
        <p>Fliqz allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, 
          to serve advertisements within the Fliqz Sites. These third-party ad 
          servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, 
          the advertisements and links that appear on the Fliqz Sites. They automatically 
          receive your IP Address when this happens. They may also use other technologies 
          (such as cookies, javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness 
          of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content. 
        </p>
        <p>Fliqz does not provide any personally identifiable information to these 
          third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except 
          as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the 
          ability to opt-in. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Fliqz 
          to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and 
          you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude 
          that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.</p>
        <p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party 
          ad servers or ad networks. Fliqz's Privacy Notice does not apply to, 
          and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web 
          sites.<br>
          <br>
          <u>Our Commitment to Data Security:</u> </p>
        <p>Fliqz uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical 
          safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. 
          We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information 
          you transmit to Fliqz and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive 
          your transmission of information, Fliqz makes commercially reasonable 
          efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note 
          that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, 
          disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, 
          or managerial safeguards. </p>
        <p>If Fliqz learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to 
          notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective 
          steps. Fliqz may post a notice on the Fliqz Sites if a security breach 
          occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive 
          notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice 
          of a security breach you should notify us at <a class="white" href="mailto:privacy@fliqz.com">privacy@fliqz.com</a>. 
        </p>
        <p><u>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy:</u></p>
        <p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For 
          that reason, Fliqz does not knowingly collect or maintain personally 
          identifiable information on the Fliqz Sites from persons under 13 years 
          of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 13. 
          IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE 
          FLIQZ SITES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. If Fliqz learns that personally 
          identifiable information of persons less than 13 years of age has been 
          collected on Fliqz without verifiable parental consent, then Fliqz will 
          take the appropriate steps to delete this information. </p>

          for and directed to Users in the United States. If you are a User accessing

          of Use,</a> you are transferring your personal information to the United 
          States and you consent to that transfer.</p>

        <p>In the event that Fliqz is acquired by or merged with a third-party 
          entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer 
          or assign the information we have collected from Users as part of such 
          merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.</p>
        <p><u>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Notice: </u> </p>

          to you and this will be reflected by the "last modified" notice below.
