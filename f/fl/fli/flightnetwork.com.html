<div class="post-content">
<h3>Electronic Device Ban:</h3>
The US and UK have moved to ban electronic devices larger than a mobile phone from cabins on flights from some Middle Eastern and North African countries.

The new security measures will mean that electronic items and devices larger than a mobile phone will be required to be carried in checked luggage only, not in the main cabin in hand luggage. This will apply to (but is not limited to), laptops, tablets, portable DVD players, cameras, e-readers and gaming devices larger than a smartphone.

The policy will come into effect on Friday 24 March 2017 and will impact flights travelling to the United States and the United Kingdom from the following list of countries.
<h3>The US policy has banned large electronic devices on flights from the following countries:</h3>
<ul>
	<li style="color: #000000;">Jordan</li>
	<li style="color: #000000;">Egypt</li>
	<li style="color: #000000;">Turkey</li>
	<li style="color: #000000;">Saudi Arabia</li>
	<li style="color: #000000;">Kuwait</li>
	<li style="color: #000000;">Qatar</li>
	<li style="color: #000000;">Morocco</li>
	<li style="color: #000000;">United Arab Emirates</li>
</ul>
<h3>The UK’s policy, is slight less restrictive and applies to flights from the following countries:</h3>
<ul>
	<li style="color: #000000;">Turkey</li>
	<li style="color: #000000;">Lebanon</li>
	<li style="color: #000000;">Jordan</li>
	<li style="color: #000000;">Egypt</li>
	<li style="color: #000000;">Tunisia</li>
	<li style="color: #000000;">Saudi Arabia</li>
</ul>
Emirates, Etihad Airways, British Airways and Qatar Airways have advised us directly that the new policy will be in place on their flights from the affected list of countries into the US and UK.

The new regulations will affect passengers transiting through the listed countries on to destinations in the US or UK and they will need to check in all prohibited devices before departing Australia.

<div class="post-content">
<h3>Samsung Note 7 Banned from most Aircrafts</h3>
Passengers and flight crews will be banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on all airline flights under emergency orders issued Friday by both Transport Canada and the U.S. Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from Canada and the United States or within either country. The phones also can’t be shipped as air cargo.

Passengers with the phones will not be allowed to board planes. And those who try to evade the U.S. ban by packing the phones in checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Transport officials in both countries warned that carrying the phones in checked luggage increases the potential danger to the flight.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the United States.

<div class="post-content">
<h3>Self-transfer Guarantee</h3>
“Self-transfer guarantee” is an exclusive policy designed to assist those passengers that are impacted by an involuntary schedule change, delay or cancellation of their confirmed flight resulting from factors, which can occur in the standard course of air transportation.

With the implementation of this policy (Self-transfer guarantee), we can offer our customers the best possible price and service experience in the travel industry. We strive to make your journey as smooth and comfortable as possible. Upon activation of this policy, in the event of an involuntary schedule change or cancellation, we shall find you a reasonable alternative flight option(s) or other means of transportation to your destination, or a refund of the unused flight portion. All passengers should be in contact with Flight Network and not the airline in order to be covered under this policy.

This policy covers two categories depending on the urgency of your file.
<h3>Category 1: ( Where the schedule change takes place more than 48 hours prior to departure)</h3>
This option applies ONLY if the schedule change (Flight change, or cancellation) takes place outside of 48 hours prior to the first leg of your confirmed itinerary, which prevents you from reaching your final destination, or your arrival in destination is delayed by more than 24 hours after the original arrival time i.e. you would either miss your connecting flight(s) or your flight(s) is cancelled.

If you become aware of the schedule change under Category 1, you must get in touch with us immediately without delay either by telephone, email or via our online chat platform found on our website. If you fail to contact us in a timely manner, you will not be covered under this guarantee. If we become aware of the change first, under category 1, we will get in touch with you within a reasonable time. Once we are informed of the change or cancellation either by you or the airline, at our discretion, we will offer you one of the following resolutions:

• &nbsp; We will find you an alternative transportation to your destination. If we can’t re-protect you with the same carrier, we will offer you an alternative flight(s) or other means of transportation to your destination entirely at our cost. In case of lack of availability, and no alternative can be offered and once we are in a <strong>mutual agreement</strong>, you can purchase the similar ticket at the airport in the same cabin class and we will refund you the price difference between the two tickets. Any other extra services or upgrades related to these new tickets will not be covered under this policy.

• &nbsp; For all unused portions, we will refund you accordingly. This option will be offered in case we fail to offer you an alternative transportation.
The options will be communicated to you via phone or email. You are obligated to respond to us promptly in ALL cases within the 24 hours of receiving our options. Once the <strong>24 hour</strong> offer period is over, our options become <strong>null and void</strong> and you will not be entitled to our guarantee.
<h3>Category 2: ( where the schedule change takes place within 48 hours prior to departure)</h3>
This option applies ONLY if the schedule change (Flight change, or cancellation) takes place within 48 hours of departure prior to the first leg of your confirmed itinerary, which prevents you from reaching your final destination, or your arrival in destination is delayed by more than 24 hours after the original arrival time i.e. you would either miss your connecting flight(s) or your flight(s) is cancelled

If you become aware of the schedule change under Category 2, you must get in touch with us immediately without delay either by <strong>telephone, email or via our online chat</strong> platform found on our website. If you fail to contact us immediately, you will not be covered under this guarantee. If we become aware of the change first under category 2, we will get in touch with you within a reasonable time. Once we are informed of the change or cancellation either by you or the airline, we will offer you one of the following resolutions at your discretion:

• &nbsp; We will find you an alternative transportation to your destination. If we can’t re-protect you with the same carrier, we will offer you an alternative flight(s) or other means of transportation to your destination entirely at our cost. In case of lack of availability, and/or substantial fare difference and once we are in a <strong>mutual agreement</strong>, we will refund you the full amount of your original ticket(s) with us. We may offer to cover part of the costs associated with this change upon a mutual agreement on a case by case basis. In rare cases where you miss the connecting flight or the flight cancellation occurs and you are unable to contact us due to time restriction, you may purchase the ticket without prior agreement with us. We will refund you the price of such alternative transportation ticket(s) upto twice the value of the original ticket price of the unused portion to your destination. Any other extra services or upgrades related to these new tickets will not be covered under this policy. We will only refund you once we are in receipt of the written documentation proof of the alternative transportation and the proof of flight delay or cancellation.

The options will be communicated to you via phone or email. You are obligated to respond to us promptly in ALL cases within the 24 hours of receiving our options or well in advance of the scheduled departure time whichever is earlier. Once the 24 hour offer period is over, our options become <strong>null and void</strong> and you will not be entitled to our guarantee

<strong>Flight Network Additional services:</strong> These additional services may be applied to category 2 scenarios under our Self-transfer guarantee. These additional services must be prearranged with our Customer care team in order to have a legitimate claim because they are solely offered at our discretion. The costs associated with these services have to be paid upfront by yourself and then claimed after the fact with valid proof ( transaction receipts). On the basis of such receipts, we will refund the costs upto the amounts listed below.

<strong>Overnight Hotel accommodation-</strong> This option is available to you if you are left stranded at the airport for the night and/or your alternative connecting flight is scheduled 8 or more hours later. This overnight is only covered if you have accepted our option with 8 or more hours of delay. In some cases, you will have to book the hotel room locally and claim a refund of $75 CAD per person up to two nights. If additional nights are required due to lack of availability with the airline for an alternative, it must be mutually arranged in advance with Flight Network.

<strong>Alternative Transportation:</strong> In cases where all the flights are sold out for the same day, we may cover the costs to book you to depart from other airports in the area in order to get you to your destination at the earliest. This has to be prearranged with Flight Network. The alternative methods can also be a train, coach bus or a taxi and will apply to all the passengers booked on the same reservation. The maximum claim limit for this is $150 CAD; inclusive of all passengers.

<strong>Meal and Beverage compensation:</strong> This is covered only if your flight connection is delayed by more than 4 hours. In such cases, we will cover upto $15 CAD per person booked on the itinerary.

<strong>Multiple destination routes:</strong> If the itinerary is impacted in a way, where the remaining segments on the same ticket are all impacted and we are unable to find a suitable alternative and the ticket is fully unused, then a refund for all flights on that ticket can be applied.

<strong>Communication and notices:</strong> Once we provide you with alternative options, your response is due back to us within 48 hours the <strong>latest</strong> in <strong>exceptional cases</strong>. If the 48 hour window is passed, the offer becomes null and void and is no longer covered under this guarantee.

***If you are offered the above mentioned alternatives by the airline(s) directly or at the airport, we cannot be held responsible for any further compensation or reimbursement.

<h3>€5 fee to travel in Schengen zone:</h3>
Travellers from countries that currently enjoy visa-free travel throughout Europe’s passport-free Schengen zone face having to apply for a document similar to the US ESTA system, as the EU beefs up security checks.

The European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), which could apply to a post-Brexit Britain, will see visitors from 60 ‘visa-waiver’ countries including the US, Canada and Australia having to pay a €5 application fee for the travel document.

The authorization, which the European Commission said will take no longer than 10 minutes and described as a “lighter more visitor-friendly regime” than a visa, will be valid for five years and for multiple trips. It will only apply to those 18 and over.

Nationals of the visa-free countries will still be able to travel without one but must obtain the authorization prior to travel in the Schengen Area.

<div class="post-content">
<h3>Check-in / Boarding times:</h3>
We recommend that passengers allow plenty of time to check-in and obtain their boarding pass for their scheduled flight. FlightNetwork® will not be responsible for those passengers who check-in past the airline cut off times. Failure to meet check-in times may result in denied boarding, the loss of your assigned seat selection, cancellation of your full booking and the entire fare paid being forfeited with no option of re booking. Please reconfirm check-in cut off times with the airline directly as the suggested timings are guidelines only and are subject to change without notice.
<h3>Suggested Check in times :</h3>
Within Canada – 60-90 minutes prior to departure

To/From US – 90-120 minutes prior to departure

To/From International – 180-210 minutes prior to departure

	<li><a class="post-title" href="#toggle-id-9">Credit Card Terms</a>
<div class="post-content">
<h3>Credit Card:</h3>
You agree to authorize the ticket issuer to charge your credit card number the amount that is shown as the Grand Total.
<h3>Appearance of charges on credit cards/Visa Debits:</h3>
The amount displayed for an ‘Authorized Transaction’ may be different from what you actually paid, as some merchants require a temporary hold be placed on additional funds. This is a common practice for many other merchants such as: gas stations, restaurants and hotels. The correct amount will display when the transaction is shown as a ‘Posted Transaction’.

A delay may occur between the time a transaction is settled and removed from Authorized Transactions, and when it appears in Posted Transactions.

Some transactions may appear as both an Authorized and a Posted Transaction until settled.

When applying a debit/visa card for payment, and in the event of a cancellation, your funds may be held up to 60days by your financial institution. We strongly recommend an alternative form of payment to avoid any inconveniences.

If you are using a foreign or a third party credit card to make your booking, our Back Office Processing Department may contact you by email or telephone to collect more information. Since Flight Network is a Canadian company, passengers using foreign credit cards may be charged a foreign transaction fee and/or currency conversion fee from their financial institute. Also note, this foreign transaction fee and/or currency conversion fee can apply to Canadian credit card holders, if the booking is made with one of our suppliers based in the US or Europe. We do not take any responsibility for foreign transaction fee and/or currency conversion fee.

Flight Network is a Canadian website that deals with many international vendors. When we display a vendor booking, using another currency, our website will show the equivalent to Canadian dollar amount. The final amount that settles on your account will depend on the exchange rate that your credit card company is using. In addition, Flight Network does not have any control over the foreign transaction fees charged by certain credit card companies.

<div class="post-content">
<h3>Confirmation:</h3>
In some circumstances, your booking will provide you with a confirmation number before a ticket has been issued. The booking process is not complete and the fare is subject to change until a ticket is issued.

FlightNetwork® is not accountable for any bookings that could not be processed due to inaccurate and/or incomplete credit card verification information, or due to other technical malfunction with internal or external pricing or booking systems, including errors by the airline or the airline reservations system, you will be notified by email of such issue(s).
<h3>Flight Reconfirmation:</h3>
Outbound and return flights must be reconfirmed with the relevant airlines at least 72 hours prior to the commencement of that leg of the journey unless specifically informed otherwise by that airline. We accept no responsibility for bookings cancelled due to non-compliance with rules set by that particular airline. We also take no responsibility for any flight rescheduling en route.

<div class="post-content">
<h3>Fares:</h3>
Most fares are discounted fares which may have cancellation and change penalties. Many of our fares may allow changes by collecting applicable penalties and a fare difference. Most fares can be canceled for a refund or a future time limited travel credit by collecting the applicable penalties and fare differences.

All cancellations must be made prior to the scheduled departure time of the first flight segment. Airport fees, where applicable, are not included and are subject to change without prior notice.

All prices are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. All prices displayed on our website are subject to change prior to ticket issuance. Increased change in pricing quoted at time of booking to time of ticket issuance shall entitle the customer to cancel the booking and obtain a full refund.
<h3>Airline Schedule Changes:</h3>
If FlightNetwork® is aware of a change; every effort will be made to advise you directly. Please ensure you contact your airline at least 24-48 hours prior to departure and to be safe, again on the day of departure. It will be your responsibility to reconfirm all your flight details before departure. If there has been a last minute change by your Airline directly (within 48 hours) it is no longer the responsibility of Flight Network to notify you, it is the responsibility of your operating Airline. This is mandated under TICO (The Travel Industry Council of Ontario) and why it is also suggested to reconfirm flights prior to departure. You should always be at the airport 3 hours prior to departure to ensure that you arrive on time for check-in and not miss your flight.

All affected schedule changes imposed by the Airlines will be notified by email. Any minor changes less than 30 minutes or with flight number changes will be automatically accepted on your behalf. Any changes 30 minutes to three hours prior or later from the original departure time(if it conflicts with another confirmed ticket itinerary schedule); passengers will be given an option to modify the flight times within 5 days of receiving the schedule change by email. This modification must be with the same carrier, in the same cabin for first available flight. These modifications can only be performed within the airline’s schedule change rebooking guidelines and cannot be guaranteed. Any voluntary changes are subject to the carrier’s normal change or cancellation penalties.

If not acknowledged within 5 days from the receipt of the email communication, Flight Network will accept it on behalf of the passengers. We cannot guarantee that the airline will allow modification after the ticket has been reissued or revalidated by the airline.

Any major schedule changes beyond three hours from the original departure times; we will send an email notification followed by a phone call to review the affected schedule change. Schedule changes delayed or advanced by 24 hours or more are subject to the next available flight or a full refund. We will not be responsible if the customer fails to enter the correct email and/or phone information at time of reservation.

All schedule changes are mandated by airlines directly. Airlines reserve the right to change, cancel or refund based on adjustments to their flight schedules. Flight Network assumes no responsibility for airline schedule changes, however we will do our best to provide alternate travel options if available.
<h3>Package/Charter Schedule Changes:</h3>
The Airline reserves the right to change flight times within the same day and to include a stop in the flight, not part of the original itinerary with no option for cancellation or compensation. Please read information below regarding the procedure for ANY CHARTER AIRLINE FLIGHT SCHEDULE CHANGE.

Any flight that departs: 0-59 minutes earlier, no notification will be provided, please check with your local airport.

If FlightNetwork® is aware of a change; every effort will be made to advise you directly. Please ensure you contact your airline at least 24 hours prior to departure and on the day of departure, it will be your responsibility to reconfirm all your flight details before departure. You should always be at the airport 3 hours prior to departure to ensure that you arrive on time for check-in and not miss your flight.

If you need to change or cancel your travel plans, it is your responsibility to notify us immediately by phone of such a request however, please note that the vast majority of our tickets are automatically issued at the time that the reservation is made and are non-refundable. Often times, once a ticket is issued there are certain airlines that will not allow changes or cancellations, and for others, fees from both the airline as well as Flight Network will apply. You should assume all reservations are non-refundable and non-changeable the moment you make the booking. In addition to any change penalties, you will also be responsible for any difference in price for the new dates selected. Furthermore, each ticket has a minimum and maximum stay validity. Minimum stays can range from 2 nights to 14 nights and maximum stays can range from 30 days to 12 months, depending on the type of ticket sold. Changes will not be permitted where the length of the ticket is less than the minimum stay or more than the maximum stay period allotted. Partially used tickets become 100% non-refundable even if only one segment of the ticket is used. Tickets can also not be used out of sequence, meaning that if you miss your first flight you can not catch your second flight. If the first flight is missed, you will forfeit the entire ticket with no option for a refund. As the intermediary, Flight Network is bound to each Airline’s Terms and Conditions and have zero control over their advertised or contracted fare rules.
<h3>Security Verification:</h3>

If these steps to verification have been successfully answered by the passenger requesting the change or cancellation, Flight Network will complete the request for the passenger.

When you book or check in for your flight, you will be asked to certify the reason for your visit. There are currently two ways to gain permission to travel to Cuba: with a general license or with a specific license.

&nbsp;

If you meet the regulations and conditions of a general license, you will not need to apply for a specific license. There are 13 categories of general licenses related to Cuba travel:

&nbsp;
<h3>12 permitted purposes include:</h3>
– Family visits

– Official government business

– Journalistic activity

– Professional research or meetings

– Educational activities or people-to-people exchanges

– Religious activities

– Sports and public events

– Support for the Cuban people

– Humanitarian projects

– Research

– Informational materials

– Authorized export activities

– Non-immigrant Cuban National

You will not qualify for a general license if the reason for your travel is not listed above, and you will be required to apply for a specific license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). All license applications are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Please see the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s OFAC FAQ page for more information.

<h3>OB Ticketing Fees</h3>
The Airline ticketing fees, also called OB Fees, are defined and collected by the validating Carrier and charged to the passenger when a ticket is issued in Australia (at first ticket issuance only). These fees can be imposed to cover charges for a specific Form of Payment (credit card) or for other ticketing services. Airline ticketing fees are non-refundable and are collected at time of ticket issuance automatically depending on the itinerary booked. You will see this as a separate additional charge on your statement which can not be determined in advance. As a result, we are unable to notify you the exact amount at time of purchase.
<h3>Flight Network Booking Fees</h3>
Flight Network will often times charge a booking fee on flights to a particular destination. This fee is lumped into the total cost of your booking. By agreeing to the total purchase price of the ticket, you have also agreed to the Flight Network booking fee. This fee is charged by Flight Network (not the airline) in CAD.

</a>
<div class="post-content">

Some airlines will charge for advanced seat selection. Advanced seat selection is subject to change at any time and is fully controlled by the operating airline(s).

Once you have purchased your ticket you can request a seat online directly through the airline’s website. Advance seat selection is available on some airlines and is subject to availability and the fare type booked. If you are unable to obtain free advanced seat selection online, the airlines do hold a percentage of seats until the day of departure for airport check-in. Customers with special needs should contact the operating airline directly for their seating needs.

Special requests are on request basis and are not guaranteed. The passengers need to contact the airlines directly to reconfirm such requests.
