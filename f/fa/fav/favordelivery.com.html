</div>
<div class="break">
<h2>What information does Favor collect?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Information. </strong>When we refer to “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” in this Privacy Policy, we mean any information by which you may be personally identified or contacted, whether online or offline. When you use the Service or fill out any forms located on the Website or the App, we may collect certain Personal Information from you, such as your first and last name, address/location, email address, phone number, and gender.. Additionally, if you apply to be a runner, we may collect certain other Personal Information from you as further described in our Runner Software Agreement and/or runner policies and procedures. As a customer user or a runner, it is always your choice whether or not to provide Personal Information. If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you may not be able to participate in certain activities or use certain features of the Service or the App.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Information. </strong>We may also collect and use technical data and related information, such as information about your device, system and application software, peripherals and other data related to your interactions with the Service (“<strong>Technical Information</strong>”). We automatically collect Technical Information through the use of “cookies” and other similar collection technologies, like pixels, web beacons and local storage. The information we collect from these technologies may include your web settings and preferences, website analytics information, device type, phone operating system and push ID. Favor does not consider this information to be Personal Information. Favor owns all Technical Information and may use it for any lawful purpose. Depending on your browser, you may be able to remove and reject cookies from our Website or the Service by changing your browser settings. The default setting of many browsers is set to accept cookies until you change your settings. Please note that if you disable or refuse cookies, certain features of the Website or the Service may become inaccessible or may not function properly.</li>

<li><strong>Tracking and Do Not Track Signals. </strong>We use the Website, the App and the Service to collect information about your activities over time and across third-party websites, applications or other online services (“<strong>Tracking Information</strong>”). Your web browser, application platform or device may allow you to opt-out of our collection of Tracking Information by selecting a “do not track” (or similar) setting. However, we do not currently have processes to address those settings or other “do not track” requests, and consequently, cannot guarantee that we will honor such requests. If you do not want us to collect this information, do not use the Website, the App or the Service.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Order Information and Other Information You Voluntarily Disclose.</strong> Certain features of Service and the App are designed to display Information that you choose to provide to other users (such as texts between customer users and the runners delivering products), or to other third parties (such as merchants from whom you order products). Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose Information by ordering products or otherwise providing such Information through the Service or the App (including, for example, if you provide building or security codes to a runner), that Information can be seen by those users or third parties to whom you send that Information. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any Information you choose to submit in connection with these features.</p>
</div>
