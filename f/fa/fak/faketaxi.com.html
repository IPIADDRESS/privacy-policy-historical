They may also obtain information about other applications that you have downloaded to your mobile device, the mobile websites you visit, and other information about you or your device in order to help analyze and serve anonymous targeted advertising on the Website and elsewhere.</p>
</li>

<p class="regular">We use the information we collect for our online forums and communities to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, on one or more occasions, to offer you products, programs, or services.</p>

</li>
<li><strong>How do we use cookies and other technical information?</strong>
<p class="regular"><em><strong>Cookies and Web beacons.</strong></em> Third-party service providers, our business partners, our affiliates, and we may send “cookies” to your computer or use similar technologies to enhance your online experience at our Website. “Cookies” are a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website. Cookies can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical information. Cookies manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through us or other networks or websites. Cookies can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser).</p>
<p class="regular">Our Website may use locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash cookies”) to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation. Adobe’s Flash player and similar applications use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. Flash cookies are not managed through your web browser, but you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe’s website.</p>
<p class="regular">We may also use “Web beacons” that monitor your use of our Website. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, or Web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s device, Web beacons are embedded invisibly on the webpages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use Web beacons to collect the following information: (1) the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the webpage on which the Web beacon appears; (2) the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the webpage on which the Web beacon appears; (3) the time the webpage containing the Web beacon was viewed; (4) the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon; and (5) the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server.</p>
<p class="regular">When corresponding with you through HTML capable email, Web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our email.</p>
<p class="regular">On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. But if you choose to furnish personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies/Web beacons.</p>
<p class="regular2"><em><strong>Managing cookies and Web beacons. </strong></em>By accepting this privacy policy, you specifically agree to our use of cookies and Web beacons as described in this privacy policy. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website. Additionally, by setting your Web browser to display HTML emails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some Web beacons. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information. Please understand that certain areas of our Website can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content or Website features. <span style="color: #ff0000;">You assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality because of disabling cookies or similar devices</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Can you opt-out of marketing communications?</strong>
<p class="regular">Yes. We provide you with an opportunity to express your preferences for receiving marketing communications from us or from unaffiliated third parties. If you ever decide in the future that you would like to update these preferences, (1) you may log into your account to adjust your settings, (2) you may follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any marketing email you receive from us, or (3) you may send us an email at <a href="mailto:support@ruseful.com">support@ruseful.com</a> and we will edit your preferences based on your instructions. If you previously chose to receive push notifications on your mobile device from us but no longer wish to receive them, you can manage your preferences either through your device or app settings, depending on the type of device.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>How secure is your personal information?</strong>
<p class="regular">We take reasonable administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to safeguard and protect your information from unauthorized access or disclosure. This includes using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the personal information you input, and storing your information in encrypted form behind a firewall designed to block access from outside our network.</p>
<p class="regular2">Although we use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of your information, transmissions on the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. Moreover, we cannot assure you that your personally identifiable information that we collect will not be used or disclosed inconsistently with this privacy policy. We assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of any of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond our reasonable control.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>What about other websites linked to our Website?</strong>
<p class="regular">Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this privacy policy concerning personally identifying information that you provide directly to those third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves. We neither own nor control the third-party websites accessible through our Website. Thus, this privacy policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered by third parties that operate them. We assume no responsibility for the content or the privacy policies of any other websites that may provide links to our Website or to whom we may provide links, or for the privacy policies of any of their advertisers. Before visiting a third party website, whether by means of a link on this Website or otherwise, and before providing any personally identifying information to any third party, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies any practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect your privacy.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>What is “Do Not Track” and does the Website follow it?</strong>
<p class="regular">Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in your Web browser. DNT is a way for you to inform websites and services that you do not want certain information about your webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collect and that is why we provide you the ability to opt-out. However, we do not recognize or respond to any DNT signals as the Internet industry works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Do special rules apply to California residents?</strong>
<p class="regular">Yes. If you are a California resident, you have the right to receive: (1) information identifying any third party company to whom we may have disclosed, within the past calendar year, personal information concerning you and your family for our direct marketing purposes; and (2) a description of the categories of personal information disclosed. You must make a request in writing to us to obtain this information. We will not process your request unless it includes your name and email address, the URL for the website you visited, and a return address. We will only honor one request per calendar year. Please email your request to <a href="mailto:support@ruseful.com">support@ruseful.com</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>How do you update or correct your information?</strong>
<p class="regular">To access the personally identifiable information that our Website collected about you, to correct factual errors in this information, or to update your information, please log into your account or send an email to <a href="mailto:support@ruseful.com">support@ruseful.com</a>. To help protect your privacy and security, we will take commercially reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Can we change this privacy policy?</strong>
<p class="regular">Yes. We may amend this privacy policy, as we believe necessary or convenient to operate our Website. If we do make a change, we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice of any change by posting notice of the amended privacy policy on our Website at least 30 days before its effective date. Each version of this privacy policy will identify when we last modified it at the top of the webpage and we will keep prior versions of this privacy policy in an archive for your review. Unless we obtain your express consent, any revised privacy policy will apply only to information collected after its effective date, and not to information collected under any earlier privacy policies. We encourage you to frequently check this webpage for any changes to this privacy policy. If you do not agree to our amended privacy policy, you may cancel your membership before or after the amended privacy policy becomes effective as provided in the terms of use. If we do not hear from you, we will assume, and you agree, that your continued access to our Website after the amended privacy policy’s effective date shows your acceptance of our amended privacy policy, and thus the amended privacy policy will govern your access to or use of the Website after the effective date.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>What if you have more questions or want to contact us?</strong>
<p class="regular">If you have any questions about our privacy policy, our practices, or your dealings with us, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@ruseful.com">support@ruseful.com</a>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Please note that persons under 18 or the applicable age of majority are prohibited from accessing our Website, and we do not collect any personal information from persons under 18 or the applicable age of majority</strong></span>.</p>
