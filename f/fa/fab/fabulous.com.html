   <p><br><b>Fabulous.com - Privacy Policy</b><br>
     <br>
     We at Fabulous.com, and our 
     affiliated website operators, pride ourselves on providing 
     you, the customer, with a range of exciting online products 
     and services. As part of this process, we may from time 
     to time, ask you to provide us with certain personal 
     information, for example, your name, date of birth, 
     email address and credit card details. <br>
   </p>
   <p><b>Protecting your privacy</b></p>
  
   Fabulous.com takes all reasonable steps to protect 
   the privacy of our customers and ensure that the personal 
   information we collect is not ordinarily disclosed to 
   third parties without the customer’s consent.<br>
   However, there may be times when Fabulous.com 
   may be required to disclose personal information of a 
   customer without their express consent. This may occur 
   where we have reason to believe that disclosing the information 
   is<br>
   <ul>
     <li>necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action 
       against the customer or another person who may be 
       causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally 
       or unintentionally) the rights or property of Fabulous.com Pty Ltd
       other customers 
       or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; 
       or</li>
     <li>required by law.</li>
   </ul>
   <p><b>Why we need to obtain personal information ABOUT 
     YOU</b></p>
   <p>
     Your personal information is used to enable us to deliver 
     our online products and services to you. For example 
     most of our products and services require some form 
     of registration or subscription, while others require 
     a payment to be made via a secure credit card facility. 
     Your contact details may also be required from time 
     to time to notify you of competition prizes you may 
     have won.<br>
     Some of the information we collect, including that obtained 
     from our customer feedback facilities, is used to help 
     us develop and improve the quality of our products and 
     services, which in turn, provides you with a more satisfying 
     and enjoyable online experience.</p>
   <p><b>What we do with your personal information</b></p>
   <p>Your email address and other personal information may 
     be used to enable us to send you marketing or promotional 
     material (such as promotional offers) on other products 
     and services that we consider may be of interest to 
     you. However, you may at any time, notify us that you 
     do not wish to receive this material via an “opt-out” 
     facility contained on our websites.<br>
     <br>
     If you no longer wish us to keep a record of your personal 
     information or you need to some of the particulars (for 
     example, your address), you may contact us at the member 
     information page on our websites or by emailing our 
     Customer Support Group at support@fabulous.com, 
     so we can correct, update or remove the information 
     you have given us.<br>
     <br>
     The information you provide to Fabulous.com 
     is also shared among  and the operators 
     of our affiliated websites.<br>
     <br>
     Fabulous.com also shares collective information 
     about our users (on an anonymous basis) with our advertisers, 
     business partners, sponsors and other third parties. 
     For example, we may disclose the fact that membership 
     to one of our websites is “X” percent male 
     and “Y” percent female. <br>
     This data is used to gain a better understanding of 
     our customer base, thus enabling us to tailor our website 
     content to our customers specific wants and needs.</p>
   <p><b>How we collect information about you</b></p>
   <p>
     Fabulous.com may collect personal information 
     about you and your surfing habits in a number of ways, 
     including:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Directly from you, such as when you enter your personal 
       details on our websites to register or subscribe to 
       our services);</li>
     <li>Indirectly, by keeping a record of our users IP 
       addresses and through the use of “cookies”.</li>
     <li>Use of IP Addresses.</li>
   </ul>
   <p><br>
     An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned 
     to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web 
     servers, (the big computers that "serve up" 
     Web pages) automatically identify your computer by its 
     IP address.<br>
     We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, 
     to report aggregate information to our advertisers, 
     and to audit the use of our site. When guests request 
     pages from our sites, our servers may log the guests' 
     IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to 
     anything personally identifiable, which means that a 
     user's session will be logged, but the user remains 
     anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to 
     identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce 
     compliance with our house rules or terms of service 
     or to protect our service, site, customers or others. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Some services provided by Fabulous.com, such 
     as certain message boards, may display IP addresses 
     along with the message poster's name and message. Please 
     review each service prior to use and only uses those 
     that disclose information you are comfortable with sharing.</p>
   <p><br>
     <b>Use of Cookies</b><br>
     <br>
     What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information 
     that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive 
     for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing 
     easier for you by saving your preferences while you're 
     at our site. We never save passwords or credit card 
     information in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry 
     standard and you'll find them at most major Web sites.<br>
     <br>
     By showing how and when guests use a site, cookies help 
     us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many 
     improvements and updates to the site are based on such 
     data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This 
     information is most easily tracked with cookies. We 
     use the information from cookies to provide services 
     better tailored to our users needs.<br>
     <br>
     Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. 
     You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or 
     indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note 
     that some parts of the Fabulous.com service will 
     not function properly or may be considerably slower 
     if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, 
     you will not be able to set personalized news preferences 
     or you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, 
     entering contests, or playing games.<br>
     You may also get cookies from our sponsors or advertisers 
     websites. Fabulous.com has no control over this.</p>
   <p><br>
     <b>Use of Web Bugs</b><br>
     <br>
     What are web bugs ? A web bug is an electronic tag that 
     is placed on a web page. It can be used to count the 
     number of visitors to our sites and gather information 
     and develop profiles about people who visit our site 
     and/or click on links on our sites. Such devices are 
     also known as ‘invisible’ or ‘1-by-1’ 
     GIFs due to their incredibly small size which usually 
     cannot be detected. </p>
   <p>We use web bugs on our websites to track both the source 
     and destination of visitors to our sites. This is required 
     for proper accounting and reporting requirements of 
     our affiliate program Dark Blue as well as to help us 
     to provide our visitors with what they want to see and 
     do online.</p>
   <p><br>

     date of birth, your hobbies, etc.<br>

     or the email address of your parent or guardian, so 
     that we can contact them and ask for their permission

     for example, their name, date of birth and contact details, 
     so that we can register them as a member.<br>

     from your child, they are required to provide us with 
     an e-mail address at which you, their parent or guardian 
     can be contacted, so that we can obtain your consent.<br>

     to participate in some contests and promotions, if they 
     win, notification and prizes are sent to the parents 
     or guardians at the address specified in the initial 
     registration process. Publication of contest winners 
     names, ages, or images for individuals under 13 require 
     parental or guardian consent.<br>

     for the specific contest or promotion).<br>

     in our member directory or to receive direct marketing
