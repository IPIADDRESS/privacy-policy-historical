  <br><h3>Cookies</h3>

  <p>Fab and other members of our group of companies that provide us with services as well as our external service providers may place cookies or web beacons onto your computer when you visit the Fab website. Fab uses cookies; cookies are small files that are stored on your hard drive. They make navigation easier. Cookies also help us with identification. We use these cookies and web beacons to monitor your preferences and present the Fab website in the best possible way, to recognise returning users, to measure user traffic and activities during visits to the Fab website, to monitor and improve our service and to guard against fraud. We also use cookies to individualise our service, content, advertising and product line. We may use the services of external advertising companies which may place cookies in order to allow them to collect and use anonymous data concerning your visit to the Fab website.

You can block cookies at any time by changing your browser settings. However, this might mean that we are unable to provide certain services. In order to register as a member of Fab your browser must be set to accept cookies.

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie concerning your use of the website is usually sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there. When the IP anonymisation on this website is activated, your IP address is first shortened by Google in the member states of the European Union or in other states that are party to the agreement on the European Economic Area. In exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. Google uses this information at the request of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of the website, compile reports on website activities and provide additional services concerning website use and internet use to the operator of this website. The IP address sent by your browser as part of the Google Analytics process will not be combined with other Google data. You can prevent storage of the cookies by appropriate settings of your browser. Please take note that in this case you might not be able to use all the functions of this website.

</p>



  <br><h3>Use of Facebook plugins</h3>

  <p>The Fab website can integrate the social network plugins of Facebook, 1601 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. The plugins are identified by a Facebook logo or the add-on “Facebook Social Plugin”. An overview of the Facebook plugins is provided here. When you visit a Fab website that contains such a plugin, the plugin establishes a direct link between your browser and the Facebook server and informs Facebook that you have visited our site using your IP address. When you click the Facebook plugin while you are logged in on your Facebook account, you will be able to link the content of the Fab webpages to your Facebook profile. Facebook can then attribute your visit to the Fab website to your user account. Please note that we, the providers of the pages, receive no information concerning either the content of the data transmitted or their use by Facebook. Additional information is provided in the data protection declaration of Facebook, which can be accessed here.

If you do not want Facebook to attribute your visit to the Fab website to your Facebook user account, please log out of your Facebook user account.
</p>



  <br><h3>Links to other websites</h3>

  <p>The Fab website contains links to other websites. We should point out that we do not influence the presentation or content of other websites. Nor can we therefore accept any liability for the up-to-dateness, correctness, completeness or quality of information provided there. Fab is not responsible for the data protection methods or contents of these sites and does not regularly monitor them. Please read the data protection declarations on these sites if you are concerned about their methods of data collection and usage.
  </p>


  <br><h3>Altering or deleting your personal data; right to information</h3>

  <p>You are entitled to be informed about the data stored in connection with your person and to have them corrected or deleted.

We will, on request, inform you as quickly as possible as required by law as to whether or what personal data of yours is stored with Fab.

As a registered member, you can access, change or remove your personal data at "My account". We do our best to enter changes in our database as quickly as possible. However, not all databases can immediately be updated and old data may remain in our archives and records for a short period until they are updated. We also might not be able to send changes to partners, suppliers or external service providers who have already received your data or information. When you cancel your membership or when your member account is blocked, we are entitled to retain certain data to prevent re-registration.

We will keep information in certain circumstances even if you might have asked for it to be deleted so that we can settle disputes, analyse programs, implement our general terms and conditions of business and shopping rules and comply with legal requirements. For both technical and legal reasons this information is never completely deleted from our database, including saved back-up systems.

If incorrect information about you should be kept despite our endeavours to ensure that data are up-to-date and correct we will rectify this at your request.
