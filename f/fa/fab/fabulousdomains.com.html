	<p>This Privacy Policy explains why and how we collect certain personal information from our customers and the visitors to our websites, and what we do with that information. </p>

<h4>ABOUT THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h4>	<p>This Privacy Policy has been drafted to comply with the National Privacy Principles set out in the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). More information about the Privacy Act is available on the Australian Privacy Commissioner's website at <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au">http://www.privacy.gov.au</a>.
</p>
<h4>WHY WE NEED TO COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>	<p>Personal information from our Customers and Visitors is used to enable FabulousDomains.com to deliver our online products and services to our Customers and Visitors. For example most of our products and services require some form of registration or subscription, while others require a payment to be made. Contact details of our Customers and Visitors may also be required from time to time to notify them of competition prizes they may have won.</p>
	<p>Some of the information we collect, including that obtained from our online enquiry/feedback facilities, is used to help FabulousDomains.com develop and improve the quality of our products and services, which in turn, provides both our Customers and Visitors with a more satisfying and enjoyable online experience.</p>
<h4>WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>	<p>Customer’s email addresses and other personal information provided by customers may be used to enable us to send promotional material (on other products and services) that we consider may be of interest to customers. However, customers may at any time, notify us that they do not wish to receive this material via an “opt-out” facility contained on our websites.</p>
	<p>Personal information that Customers provide to Fabulous.com may also be shared among our subsidiaries. All subsidiaries are required to keep such information private and confidential and otherwise deal with such personal information strictly in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p>Fabulous.com also shares information about our Customers (on an anonymous basis) with our advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we may disclose the fact that membership to one of our websites is “X” percent male and “Y” percent female.</p>
	<p>This information is used to gain a better understanding of our customer base, thus enabling us to tailor our website content specifically to our Customer’s wants and needs.
</p>
<h4>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</h4>	<p>Personal Information provided to FabulousDomains.com<br>
FabulousDomains.com collects and stores personal information that is voluntarily provided by our Customers as part of doing business with us. Such information may include Customer’s full name, date of birth, addresses (including home, postal and email address) and telephone numbers. We also collect and securely store Customer’s payment details such as their credit card details (where necessary).</p>
	<p>FabulousDomains.com collects this personal information and makes use of these details to provide you with our products and services and to better manage our relationship with you.</p>
	<p><strong>Website activity</strong></p>
	<p>FabulousDomains.com Ltd provides products and services via a number of different websites. When Visitors view our websites, our web servers record anonymous information such as the time and date this website is viewed and the web pages/URL’s requested. This information assists us to improve the structure of our websites and monitor their performance.</p>
	<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
	<p>FabulousDomains.com makes use of cookies on this website. Cookies are pieces of information that a Website transfers to a Visitors hard drive for record-keeping purposes. The browser stores the information, and sends the information back to the server each time a Visitor request a webpage from the server. The use of cookies is an industry standard and are used by the majority of Website operators.</p>
	<p>By keeping a record of how and when Visitors view our websites, cookies help us see which web pages are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to our websites are based on such data as the total number of Visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide products and services that are better tailored to our Customers and Visitors needs.</p>
	<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. Visitors can reset their browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some parts of our websites, or the products and services provided through our websites, may not function properly or may be considerably slower if you do not enable cookies on your internet browser. </p>
	<p><strong>IP Addresses</strong></p>
	<p>FabulousDomains.com website servers register the type of web browsers that Visitors are using and their IP address when Visitors access our websites.</p>
	<p>FabulousDomains.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate traffic information to our Customers, fraud detection and to generally audit the use of our websites. When Visitors request pages from our websites, our servers may log the Visitor’s IP addresses. </p>
	<p>FabulousDomains.com does not normally link IP addresses to any personal information, which means that a Visitor’s session will be logged, but the Visitor otherwise remains anonymous.<br>
FabulousDomains.com can and will use IP addresses to identify a Visitor when it is necessary to enforce compliance with our terms of service or to protect the integrity of our services and  websites, as well as to protect our interests and those of our Customers. </p>
	<p>Some services provided by FabulousDomains.com, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. Please review each service prior to use and only uses those that collect and/or disclose information you are comfortable with disclosing.</p>
<h4>WHEN WE DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>	<p>FabulousDomains.com takes all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of our Customers and Visitors and to ensure that the personal information we collect and store is protected against unauthorised disclosure to third parties.</p>
	<p>However, there may be times when FabulousDomains.com may be required to disclose personal information of a Customer or Visitor without their consent. This may occur where we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is:</p>
	<p>·	necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against the Customer, Visitor or another person who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights or property of FabulousDomains.com or its subsidiaries, other Customers or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; or</p>
	<p>·	required by law.</p>
