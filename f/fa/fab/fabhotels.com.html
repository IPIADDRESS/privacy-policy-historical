<p>This document is an electronic record in terms of (i) Information Technology Act, 2000; (ii) the rules framed
there under as applicable; and (iii) the amended provisions pertaining to electronic records in various statutes as
amended by the Information Technology Act, 2000. This electronic record is generated by a computer system and does not
require any physical or digital signatures.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) is published in accordance with: (i) Section 43A of the Information Technology Act,
2000 and (ii) Regulation 4 of the Information Technology (Reasonable security practices and procedures and sensitive personal information)
Rules, 2011 (“SPI Rules”).</p>
<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how <strong>Casa2 Stays Private Limited</strong> its subsidiary and affiliate corporations,
successors, and assigns uses and protects the information you provide. This privacy policy (the “<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) applies to the services
provided by Casa2 Stays Private Limited on its website www.fabhotels.com and/or mobile application under the brand FabHotels
(hereinafter collectively referred to as “<strong>FabHotels</strong>”). This Privacy Policy applies to all Users (“<strong>Users</strong>”) of FabHotels.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers: (i) the type of information collected from the Users of FabHotels including sensitive personal data or information;
(ii) the purpose, means and modes of usage of such information; and (iii) how and to whom such information which has been collected will be disclosed</p>
<h5>1. WHAT INFORMATION FABHOTELS COLLECTS FROM YOU</h5>
<p>FabHotels may collect two (2) types of information about you: Personal and Non-Personal.</p>
<p><strong>1.1. Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>Personal Information refers to information that lets FabHotels know the specifics of who you are and which may be used to identify, contact or
locate you (e.g. name, age, gender, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address). FabHotels may collect Personal Information when you use
the FabHotels including, without limitation, setting up account information, making bookings of hotels, filling out surveys, corresponding with
FabHotels, or otherwise volunteering information about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>1.2. Non-personal Information</strong></p>
<p>Non-Personal Information refers to information that, by itself, does not identify you as a specific individual (e.g. demographic information
or website visitations). FabHotels may collect Non-Personal Information through any of the methods discussed above as well as automatically
through use of industry standard technologies described further below.</p>
<h5>2. HOW FABHOTELS COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION</h5>
<p>The Personal Information practices set forth apply to all FabHotels’ customers worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>2.1. Registration </strong></p>
<p>Prior to using one or more of the FabHotels, FabHotels may require certain Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to create an
individual account (“Account”) or to enable features or functionality of the FabHotels. Failure to provide all required information required
by FabHotels may prevent access to any or all FabHotels, and failure to maintain accurate information may result in suspension or termination
of access to any or all FabHotels services.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Information Collected Through Technology</strong></p>
<p>While you are able to visit the FabHotels and remain anonymous, FabHotels or its third party service providers may still collect Non-Personal

your Internet service provider). Such information may be gathered by the following methods:</p>
<p>a) <strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies, including local shared objects, are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your

<p>b) <strong>IP Address.</strong> You may visit many areas of the FabHotels Site anonymously without the need to become a registered User.
Even in such cases, FabHotels may collect IP addresses automatically. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your
computer whenever you begin Services with an Internet services provider. Each time you access the FabHotels Site and each time you request
one of FabHotels’s pages, the server logs your IP address.</p>
<p>c) <strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in web pages and e-mails. FabHotels may use these
technical methods in HTML e-mails that FabHotels sends to Users to determine whether they have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links
in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is Personal Information.</p>
<p>d) <strong>Tracking Content Usage.</strong> If you use the FabHotels Services and you post audio visual materials including, without limitation, text,
logos, artwork, graphics, pictures, advertisements, sound and other related intellectual property contained in such materials
(collectively, “Content”) to your website or to a third party website, FabHotels tracks and captures Non-Personal Information associated
with User accounts and the use of Content.</p>
<h5>3. HOW FABHOTELS USES YOUR INFORMATION</h5>
<p>FabHotels uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services

<p>FabHotels may share your registration data, usage data and any other data related to your use of the FabHotels site with third parties
to the extent set forth in our Terms of Use as updated regularly. We otherwise use all reasonable efforts to protect your information.
Additionally, in the event that all resources of the FabHotels company, that is to say, the entire FabHotels, are acquired by another company
the personal data required in order to continue to operate FabHotels are acquired by the buyer.</p>
<p><strong>3.1. System Administration</strong></p>
<p>FabHotels may use Non-Personal Information for the purposes of system administration, assisting in diagnosing problems with FabHotels
servers, monitoring FabHotels’s system performance and traffic on the FabHotels and to gather broad demographic information about FabHotels
customers.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Personalization</strong></p>
<p>FabHotels uses Cookies and IP Addresses to track features such as delivering Content specific to your interests and informing you of new,
relevant services or certain third party offerings.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Notices to Registered Users</strong></p>

you e-mails to verify your identity or to notify you if FabHotels believes your use of FabHotels violates any applicable agreement for the
use of the FabHotels.</p>

<p>FabHotels may use your Personal Information to send you e-mails periodically listing promotions or events relating to the FabHotels or
from FabHotels’ marketing partners or sponsors. You have the choice to opt-out of receiving such promotional e-mails by sending an e-mail
to ceo@fabhotels.com and/or following the instructions in such correspondence. Once FabHotels’ has processed your opt-out request,
FabHotels will not send you promotional e-mails unless you opt back in to receiving such communications.</p>

If you report a problem with FabHotels, FabHotels may collect this information in a file specific to you. You may contact FabHotels at
ceo@fabhotels.com to request the removal of this information from FabHotels’ database.</p>
<h5>4. HOW TO ACCESS AND CHANGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
<p>Upon request, FabHotels shall allow Users to update or correct Personal Information previously submitted, but only to the extent
such activities will not compromise privacy or security interests. Additionally, upon request, FabHotels shall delete Personal Information
from the database where such information is stored; however, it may be impossible to entirely delete a User’s entry without some residual

<h5>6. SAFEGUARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
<p><strong>6.1 Security Measures</strong></p>
<p>FabHotels takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of Personal Information.
These include, but are not limited to, internal reviews of: (a) FabHotels’s data collection; (b) storage and processing practices; (c)
electronic security measures; and (d) physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where FabHotels stores
Personal Information. All FabHotels employees, contractors and agents who access Personal Information are bound by confidentiality obligations
and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution or unauthorized use or disclosure of Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>6.2 Third Party Links</strong></p>
<p>The FabHotels may contain links to third parties who may collect Personal Information and Non-Personal Information directly from you.
Additionally, FabHotels may use third parties to provide components of the FabHotels. In either case, such third parties may have separate
privacy policies and data collection practices, independent of FabHotels. FabHotels: (a) has no responsibility or liability for these independent
policies or actions; (b) is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites; and (c) does not make any warranties or
representations about the contents, products or services offered on such websites or the security of any information you provide to them.</p>
<h5>7. CHANGES TO FABHOTEL'S PRIVACY POLICY</h5>
<p>FabHotels continually strives to implement new technologies and processes to better protect you, your privacy and your use of the FabHotels.
As a result, changes to this Privacy Policy may be made by FabHotels from time to time. In no event will these changes result in the degradation
of any of the security measures designed to protect you from unauthorized disclosure, as such measures are described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h5>8. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING CHILDREN UNDER 12 YEARS OF AGE</h5>
<p>Use of the FabHotels is not intended for minors under the age of 18 (“Minors”). Minors are not authorized to use the FabHotels,
even if Minors set up an Account or accept the terms of any agreement for FabHotels. Parents or guardians may authorize Minors between the

<h2>Simply put, we are a new age <a href="https://www.fabhotels.com">budget hotels</a> brand, now with 150+ hotels in 15+ Indian cities. </h2>
<p>We faced a huge problem finding a reliable, trustworthy and value for money accommodation
wherever we travelled, and unwillingly, ended up spending on top-end hotels instead.
This was a problem that a lot of our friends faced as well! Hence we decided to do something about it.
We decided to launch our own brand of budget hotels!</p>
<p>Say hello to FabHotels! With technology at the center of consumer experience and backend operations,
we are building a budget hospitality brand missing for so long in India. All our hotels follow rigorous
housekeeping procedures, undergo strict auditing processes, and have courteous trained staff and to ensure
a hassle-free experience every time you check in.</p>
<p>Don't go by what we say. Next time you are looking for a value for money stay, give us a shot.
You would see what we mean.</p>
