<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>FabJob is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information obtained by reason of your relationship with FabJob. This privacy policy explains the types of customer personal information we collect, how the information is used, and the steps we take to ensure your personal information is handled appropriately.</p>
<p>This privacy policy applies to FabJob and any of its partners which control and make use of visitor information collected via this site.</p>
<p>Our policies and practices have been designed to comply with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and corresponding provincial privacy acts.</p>
<h4>What is Personal Information?</h4>
<p>Personal information is information that refers to an individual specifically and is recorded in any form. Personal information includes such things as your name, email address, mailing address and credit card information. With your consent we may gather personal information from you over the telephone or by corresponding with you via mail, facsimile, the Internet, or from referrals by third parties such as your financial institution.</p>
<h4>Our Commitment to Your Privacy is Governed by the Following Privacy Principles:</h4>

<p>FabJob is responsible for all personal information under its control, including any personal information that is processed or stored directly by FabJob. We have employees in each of our business units who are accountable for compliance with these privacy and security principles.</p>
<p><strong>2. We let you know why we collect your information</strong></p>
<p>FabJob identifies the purpose for which your personal information is collected. We do this before or at the time the information is actually being collected.</p>

<p>Please note that this site and e-book versions of our publications contain links to other web sites, over which FabJob has no control and, which may not be governed by this privacy statement.</p>
<p><strong>3. We limit collection of your personal information</strong></p>
<p>Personal information is used only for limited purposes. For example, when you order one of our products through our Web site or request future communications about FabJob areas of interest, such as specific FabJob publications or marketing campaigns, we may use the information you submit to create a personal profile to customize our response to further requests or inquiries. We may also use the information to personalize your Web site experience. In addition, the webmasters may, where necessary, use your information for various site related tasks.</p>

<li>Protecting against fraud or error</li>
<li>Providing product and services requested by you</li>
<li>Recommending products and services that FabJob believes will be of interest and provide value to you</li>
<li>To comply with legal and governmental requirements</li>
</ul>

<strong>"I just finished your e-book and found it to be informative, lively, and encouraging. I've been researching this field for a few months now, but I found new information and suggestions that were very helpful."</strong><br>— Vickie Trihy, Waitsfield, Vermont
<br><br>

<strong>"What a surprise! The guide was more than I ever hoped for with tons of information about everything you might need to start a new business. You sure get a lot for your money."</strong><br>— Carol Ruth Kennedy, Cave Creek, Arizona
<br><br>

<strong>"I just purchased your e-book and it is fantastic! There is so much information that I couldn’t find anywhere else searching the Web. This was definitely a great investment!!"</strong><br>— Jenny Trevino, Campbell, California
<br><br>

<strong>"Let me congratulate you on the absolute best guides for ease-of-use and best supported sources! The writing style is at an appropriate level, very clear, and easy to understand. They are really effective guides and give you the guidelines for your dream career."</strong><br>— Nadia Al Nahdi, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia
<br><br>

<strong>"Thank you so much for all the outstanding information. I am in the process of changing careers and your guide has been very helpful in getting me started."</strong><br>— Maggie McNerney, Canton, Connecticut<br><br>

<strong>"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is complete, simple and helped me a lot for establishing and launching my company. I will recommend people come in your website if they are looking for a dream career."</strong><br>— Adela Yadallee, France
<br><br>

<strong>"I'm currently an English teacher in South Korea (returning to the States in a few months), so ordering a quick and simple ebook from FabJob.com prevented the hassles of having to order overseas. FabJob.com has given me the confidence to dive in, just like I've always wanted to, whereas before I felt shaky and without a mentor. I'll always go through this ebook for future questions especially during my first year. Thanks!"</strong><br>— Shannon Chapman, Chicago, Illinois (residing in S. Korea)
<br><br>
<strong>"Thank you for the very hard work obviously put forth and the extensive research that must have been done to compile such an in-depth and relevant guide. I recommend fabjob for anyone who wants out of the rat race and to be out on their own."</strong><br>— Dylan Robinson, Kingston Springs, TN
<br><br>
<strong>"I purchased the e-book three years ago and I have since started my own company. The book has been my living guide especially in my first year of operation. In many ways, I could not have gone through the starting year without it. This year I am expanding my operation and I was panic stricken for a while to find out that I lost the e-book. I wrote to FabJob about it and in less than an hour I received another copy of it. Congratulations to FabJob! You have great books and your customer service is amazing."</strong>
<br>— Athanasia Nointin, Sabah, Malaysia
<br><br>
<strong>"This Fabjob Guide has taken my dream to a reality. After reading this guide I was truly inspired. I have jumped feet first into my new business. I am thrilled, and thankful that I have found Fabjob guides to initiate my journey to true success. Thank you so much!"</strong><br>— Katie Martinis, Silver Spring, MD
<br><br>
<strong>"I just downloaded your manual (yesterday) and can’t tell you how helpful it’s been to me. I have had the most difficult time finding resources so stumbling upon your web-site was striking the lottery for me. I can apply just about every great tip to my own job search. Thank you so much for this valuable resource!"</strong><br>— Jennifer Minniti, Portland, Oregon
<br><br>
<strong>"Before reading the guide I was curious about getting into the field, but after reading the guide I am CONFIDENT! This guide answered every question I had and provided information I would have never thought of. I am meeting with my business partner this week to lay the plans to our new business and I have FabJob to thank for gathering what I needed to know in one reference. THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!"</strong><br>— Natasha Liburd, Loganville, Georgia<br><br>
