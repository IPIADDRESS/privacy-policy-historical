  <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
  
  <p class="updated">This Privacy Policy was last updated on Sep 20, 2016.</p>

  <h3>Our Policy</h3>
  
  <p>Your privacy is very important to us. This privacy policy addresses how TechStyle, Inc. (f/k/a Just Fabulous, Inc.), and its subsidiary Personal Retailing, Inc. (d/b/a FabKids) and affiliated brands (collectively, "FabKids") collect and use information you provide. By visiting www.fabkids.com (this "Site"), and providing your information to us, you agree to accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h3>What Information Is Collected</h3>
  
  <p>We group the collection of user information into two categories: personal, which is information identifiable to a specific member, and aggregate, which is general demographic information that does not identify any individual member. Personal information may include your name, email address, mailing address, credit card information and phone number. We may also collect certain demographic information such as your Site preferences, sizes, age, gender, geographical location, language, time zone, income and education (some of the information we ask for may be optional). FabKids may use or disclose aggregate information for any purpose.</p>

 <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>

 <p>We collect personal information to make our services related to this Site (the "Services") more rewarding for you to use, including billing, shipping and tracking your orders. If we have any questions or concerns regarding your order, we may use this information to contact you. We also use this information for internal purposes, such as studying our customers' preferences and improving customer experience on the Site. We may also use your information to contact you for promotional purposes and provide customer service to you. If you enter into a sweepstakes, contest or similar promotion, we may use the information you provide to administer those activities. We may combine information about you with information from other sources in order to improve the quality of our Services.</p>

<p>We also receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information, which is collected passively using various technologies, and cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve you, we often conduct research on customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the personal and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. We may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>

  <h3>How Is This Information Shared</h3>

<p>There are certain circumstances in which we may share your personal information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:<br>
</p><ul>
<li>We may share information about you with trusted third parties in order to improve your customer experience. These third parties may contact you about products, services or promotions you may be interested in, or to otherwise improve your customer experience with this Site.</li>
<li>We may share information about you, such as your name, address, email address, as well as a record of any transactions you conduct on our website or offline with us via our third-party advertising partners and its service providers, in order to deliver to you banner advertisements and other advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain websites. Our advertising partners will make the data we provide to it anonymous. To learn more about the use of this information or to make choices about receiving personalized advertising provided by third parties, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking here (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" target="fk-privacy">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a>).</li>
<li>As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, your information may be part of the transferred assets.</li>
<li>When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property and safety of FabKids, its users or the public.</li>
<li>As required by law, to comply with a judicial proceeding or court order, to exercise our rights, or to defend against any claims.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

  <h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>

<p>This Site uses cookies and web beacons to gather aggregated, non-personally identifiable information in order to help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of this Site users have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. Such information may be shared with trusted third parties but the information will not personally identify you. To the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information. As we develop this Site, we may gather additional information from you through the use of other technologies.</p>


  <h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to collect anonymous information about how you use this Site by setting and accessing cookies on your computer. These cookies track information such as how often you visit our Site, what pages you view, and where you go after you leave our Site. The cookies are not connected to your personal information. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of this Site's features.</p>


  <h3>Web Beacons</h3>

<p>Web beacons, or clear gifs, are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages. Web beacons help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is effective. We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to your personal information.</p>


  <h3>Security</h3>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you provide sensitive information (such as a credit card number), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of such information. If you have any questions about security on our Site, please contact us as indicated below.</p>


  <h3>Opting Out</h3>

<p>We may occasionally send you newsletters and emails regarding special offers, promotions, features and/or product updates. We may also communicate with you on behalf of third parties about special offers, promotions, features and/or product updates we think may be of interest to you, or you may have opted-in to receive newsletters or special promotions from one of our trusted third party providers. If you decide you do not wish to receive these communications, you may opt-out by clicking the unsubscribe link or by following the instructions included in the communication. Note however that as user of the Services you cannot opt-out of some administrative communications that are reasonably necessary to the Services, such as billing or service notifications.  You may also opt-out of certain targeted advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" target="fk-privacy">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a>.</p>
