                    We receive and store information and personal data from you when you interact with us through our

                    products, promotions and updates. As we give you the opportunity to unsubscribe whenever you

        <p>The web shop for our merchandise is serviced by sprd.net AG. They collect personal data from you to 
            handle your orders, deliver services to you, process payments, and communicate with you about orders 
            respond to your requests. For further explanation and information please read the 
            <a class="link" href="https://www.spreadshirt.com/privacy-policy-C3259">sprd.net AG Privacy Policy</a>.
            Sprd.net AG does <i>not</i> share any personal data about you with us.

        <h2>How secure is information about me?</h2>
        <p>
            We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that all 
            processing of your personal data will meet the requirements by law and ensure the protection of your 
            rights. However such protection can unfortunately not be guaranteed, as no system available is one 
            hundred percent safe. We work to protect the security of your personal data during transmission by 
            using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information and the personal data you 
            input. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, 
            storage and disclosure of personal data. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally 
            request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you. It is important for you 
            to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off 
            when you finish using a shared computer, and to not use the "Keep me logged in on this device" login 
            feature in this case.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our computers are safeguarded by long and complex passwords. Our servers are physically situated in 
            the Netherlands and serviced by a Dutch company. Our physical office can only be entered by authorized 
            personnel. Visitors can only enter the building that our office is situated in, after being given 
            access by authorized personnel. We have created access profiles for our employees giving them limited 
            access to our systems and (personal) data actually needed to perform their work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your privacy is of continuous importance to us, meaning we will evaluate our privacy policy frequently 
            and are open to improvement and discussions.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What information can I access and control?</h2>
        <p>
            You can chose not to provide us certain personal data, such as your zip code. Not providing us with 
            certain data may render us unable to fully assist you. We might – for example – need more personal 
            data to verify your identity when you have lost your password.
        </p>
        <p>
            We give you access to the personal data that we keep about you and a broad range of information 
            about your account and your interactions with us for the purpose of viewing and updating or changing 
            that information. This concerns the following personal data: your address, e-mail address, 
            subscription to newsletter, an overview of historical purchases (via which you can view your 
            purchased license keys), and the amount of credit you received by using the tell-a-friend feature. 
            You can add or update certain information on your FabFilter account. You may alter your 
            subscription to the newsletter yourselves as well as the possibility to view your historical 
            purchases and associated license keys. If you don't want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, 
            please adjust this preference in your FabFilter account or use the unsubscribe link that is placed 
            at the bottom of every (promotional) e-mail of FabFilter you will receive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Certain updates and changes to Account Information are – for your safety - carefully controlled by 
            us and may for that reason not always be made by yourselves. We will be available to assist you with 
            such changes. Changes to your personal data shall be made in cooperation with us, to make sure such 
            changes are correct and are not requested by anyone else but yourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            You cannot delete your personal FabFilter account yourself. However, if you request us to do so, we 
            will delete your account for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you wish to receive an even more detailed list of the personal data we use and store about you, please
            contact us and we will inform you accordingly. If such an overview would not be sufficient to you, 
            please let us know, and we will inform you even more specifically where needed.
        </p>

        <h2>Do we share the information we receive?</h2>
        <p>
            Information about our customers and their personal data is an important part of our business and we 
            are <i>not</i> in the business of selling it to others. We share your personal data only as
            described below and with the subsidiaries that are either subject to this Privacy Policy or 
            follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.

                    We work together with Cleverbridge AG to handle sales through the/our web shop. They 
                    only have access to personal information they collected from you themselves. They process 
                    the personal information in accordance with their own Privacy Policy and as permitted by

                    We use two software systems to communicate through e-mail. All e-mails automatically 
                    generated by our website (such as the e-mails you receive when you create an account or our 
                    newsletters) are services through a program called Mandrill, that is part of the platform 
                    MailChimp. MailChimp is owned and controlled by The Rocket Science Group LLC, located in 
                    the USA. MailChimp participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. 
                    Privacy Shield Framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second software system we use concerns our support e-mail communication. The program 
                    facilitating this service is called Manuscript owned and controlled by Fogcreek Software
                    Inc. Fog Creek complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.
                    Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information 
                    transferred from the European Union to the United States. Fog Creek has certified to the 
                    Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.

        <h2>Our policy concerning personal data breaches</h2>
        <p>
            When a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to your rights and freedoms, or is 
            otherwise required by law, or when we feel this is appropriate, we will communicate such a personal 
            data breach to you without undue delay. Such a notification shall describe in clear and plain 
            language the nature of the personal data breach contains and shall at least give you the following 
            information and measures: (a) the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other 
            contact point where more information can be obtained; (b) describe the likely consequences of the 
            personal data breach; (c) describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to 
            address the personal data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible 
            adverse effects.
        </p>
        <p>
            If required by law, we shall have to inform the Dutch Data Protection Authority of a personal data 
            breach and share any information with this authority as required by law.
