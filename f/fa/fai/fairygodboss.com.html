    <h1>Fairygodboss Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy was last updated July 22, 2015.</p>
    <p>
        This policy describes the personal information collected by Fairygodboss, Inc. (“Fairygodboss,” “we” or “us”) on its sites, which include but are not limited to <a href="https://www.Fairygodboss.com">https://www.Fairygodboss.com</a>, as well as our mobile sites and native apps (together as the "Sites"), why we collect it, how we use it, and when we share it with third parties. The policy also covers the online experiences and services provided by Fairygodboss through the Sites (the “Services”). By visiting the Sites, registering as a member, or using the Services, you acknowledge and accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy"). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Fairygodboss Terms &amp; Conditions, which can be found at <a href="/terms-and-conditions">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> and which incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy or the Terms and Conditions, you may not use the Sites.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Personal Information" is information that is personally identifiable such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, personal URLs, photographs or phone numbers. We collect and use Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy from the Users of our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        By using the services or submitting personal information through the services, you expressly consent to the processing of your personal information according to this Privacy Policy. Your personal information may be processed in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.
    </p>
    <h2>Information We Collect and Opting Out of Automatic Collection</h2>
    <p>
        We collect the following information that you submit to us voluntarily:
    </p>
    <p>
        •	Our Member registration process to create an Account requires you to provide us with your e-mail address and a username and password of your choice. Furthermore, you have to provide certain information about your current or former work history in order to become a Member.
    </p>
    <p>
        •	In connection with employer reviews, work history information, and other content you may contribute, Fairygodboss (and/or its third party service providers) will collect a wide variety of employee- and salary-related information on a voluntary basis. Please be aware that while some pieces of information that you provide to us would not be sufficient to identify you when seen by another User without any context, the combination of different pieces of information that you have provided for viewing by other Users, or any contextual information, may allow other Users to identify you.
    </p>
    <p>
        •	As you use the Services, certain information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol (IP) address and the browser that you use to visit the Site. Fairygodboss may also use "cookies," “pixel tags” and other tracking technologies, to enable functionality on our websites, as well as a variety of other ways to enhance or personalize your online browsing. Fairygodboss may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) for a variety of tasks, for instance, to store your login information (if any) and your personal preferences for the Services. Pixel tags in our emails may be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email message from us. These technologies may also be used to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, other actions you take in connection with the sites and our online ads.
    </p>
    <p>
        •	We also work with third-party companies that use their tracking technologies (including cookies and pixel tags) on our websites in order to provide tailored advertisements on our behalf and on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your activity on our sites and your interaction with our advertising and other communications and use this information to determine which ads you see on third-party websites and applications. 
    </p>
    <p>
        •	You have the option to set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to access your account information and certain parts of the Services may not function as effectively or at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        •	Please note that even if you opt-out, ad tracking technologies may still collect data and you will still see ads, but they will not be targeted based upon the information collected through these tracking technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        •	We may combine the information we collect through these various technologies with other information we have collected from and about you and use it as described in this policy.
    </p>
    <h1>Information Collected from Other Sources</h1>
    <p>
        We may receive Personal Information about you from outside the Sites, for instance, from third parties that provide services for us that are related to the Services. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Services.
    </p>
    <h1>Use of Information We Collect</h1>
    <p>
        In general, information (including Personal Information) we collect is used by us to provide you and other Users with the Services, respond to requests that you make, including performing technical support, to improve the Sites and Services, to better tailor the features, performance and support of the Services, and to perform investigations consistent with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with announcements, notifications related to your use of the Services and other communications such as electronic newsletters, promotional e-mails or similar messaging.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may create anonymized information from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the information personally identifiable to you. We may use this anonymized information for internal purposes, such as analyzing usage patterns so that we may enhance the Services, and we also reserve the right to use and disclose such anonymized information at our discretion.
    </p>
    <h1>Disclosure of Personal Information</h1>
    <p>
        Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose to or share your Personal Information with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may provide your Personal Information to third party service providers and suppliers who work on behalf of or with us to provide you with some of the services and features of the Services and to help us communicate with our Users, for instance, to get User feedback or conduct services. However, these service providers and suppliers do not have any independent right to use this information except to help us provide the Services.
    </p>    
    <p>
        We may share some or all of your Personal Information with any parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "Affiliates"), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the event Fairygodboss goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, including pursuant to bankruptcy, you acknowledge that your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We may (and you authorize us to) disclose or retain, for as long as is reasonably necessary to accomplish the below, information we have collected from and about you (including Personal Information) if we believe in good faith that such disclosure or retention is necessary to:
    </p>
    <p>
        (a)	comply with relevant laws or to respond to valid subpoenas or warrants served on us or to other government requests; 
    </p>
    <p>
