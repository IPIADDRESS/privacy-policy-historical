<p><strong>What is ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù information?</strong></p>
<p>Personal information can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name, address and phone number(s). </li>
<li>Other information about the Bell product(s) that you subscribe to, such as calling features or Bell TV programming. </li>
<li>Your service usage such as cellular call records, long distance usage or Internet surfing habits. </li>
<li>Account information such as the status of your account or your method of payment. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How and why does Bell collect personal information? </strong></p>
<p>We collect information during the application process, when communicating or transacting business with you, and when providing you with service. Occasionally we collect information about you from third parties, such as credit reporting agencies for credit checks.</p>
<p>We collect information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish and maintain a responsible commercial relationship with you. For example, we may collect information to confirm your identity or to establish credit worthiness. </li>
<li>Understand your needs and preferences to make recommendations for products, services and bundled discounts. </li>
<li>Understand who the people are that use our products and services, how they use them, and how we can improve them. </li>
<li>Manage and develop Bell's business and operations. For example, we monitor usage volumes in order to plan and provision our communications networks. We also track product sales to determine the success of features, promotions and pricing. </li>
<li>Meet legal and regulatory requirements. For example, we may be required to collect information by a court order or to demonstrate compliance with a CRTC requirement. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your personal information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent.</p>
<p><strong>Does Bell store customer information outside of Canada?</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, personal information collected by the Bell companies may be stored and processed outside of Canada to provide you with service or to support Bell operations.</p>

<p><strong>Why we ask you to confirm personal information when you call Bell</strong></p>
<p>Bell places great emphasis on the security of your personal information and has safeguards in place to ensure that it is not disclosed to an unauthorized third party which is why, when calling Bell you'll be asked to confirm certain details regarding your account.</p>
<p>This safeguard will help us prevent pre-texting, often referred to as ‚Äúsocial engineering‚Äù, which refers to the fraudulent and illegal practice of misrepresenting who you are in order to obtain access to someone else' s information. Bell is aware pre-texting, although illegal, has been a practice employed by unauthorized third parties trying to obtain access to customer information.</p>
<p>The kinds of things we might ask you to confirm could include your account number, PIN or password associated with the account, details of your payment habits, service usage or identification that you might have provided when you first requested your service such as a provincial driver's licence number.</p>
<p>We therefore ask for your patience and understanding when you are asked to confirm or provide such information as this process has been established to protect your personal account information.</p>
<p><strong>What is Bell' s Voice Identification service?</strong></p>
<p>Bell's <a href="/Customer_service/Security_and_privacy/How_does_Bell_respect_my_privacy?step=7">Voice Identification service</a> (VIS) is a free service used to verify a person' s identity by using the unique characteristics of their voice.</p><br><p class="lastUpdateTag">Last Update:30/06/2011</p><div class="clearer"><!-- --></div><br><h2>Common privacy concerns</h2>
<p><strong>Does Bell monitor client Internet usage?</strong></p>
<p>Bell does not usually monitor your use of the service or the content of your emails. However, similar to other Internet service providers, Bell reserves the right to do so from time to time.</p>
<p>For example, in the normal course of business, we may need to review certain aspects such as your bandwidth consumption. This is to ensure that our service is functioning properly, but it may also be to ensure your compliance with the provisions of our Acceptable Use Policy, a copy of which can be found at the end of your service agreement.</p>
<p>Some of the things that will trigger monitoring of your use include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spamming </li>
<li>Harassment of other users </li>
<li>Uploading, downloading or otherwise transmitting materials which are protected by copyrights or other intellectual property rights </li>
<li>Assisting or engaging in the fraudulent use of telecommunications services </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and what does it have to do with the Internet?</strong></p>
<p>Deep packet inspection or DPI is a technology used in the industry to examine the types of traffic going across a network, but not the content. During peak periods, Bell uses DPI to identify peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing traffic which is less time sensitive than other real-time sensitive applications, such as Web browsing or video streaming. Because P2P file sharing applications are less time sensitive, they can be slowed when Internet traffic becomes congested during peak periods without interrupting use of the service.</p>
<p>When Bell uses DPI as part of its traffic management measures during peak periods of Internet usage, we do not examine the actual content of traffic and we only collect, for a limited time, your IP address. For example, we do not know the content of your communications nor your search activities. However, for traffic management to work properly, we use DPI technology to assess traffic data along with each IP address to determine what type of traffic it is so that we can treat it accordingly (e.g. if it is P2P file sharing traffic, we may slow it down during times of peak Internet usage to support other activities like Web browsing and video streaming). Once the traffic has been sorted by type for traffic management purposes, it is not retained as part of the usage pattern of any IP address.</p>

<p>Because Bell is committed to continually improving its customer contact experience, some customer calls may be recorded and used for the ongoing training and development of our employees. Consistent with federal privacy legislation, customers are informed by a pre-recorded message that their call may be recorded for quality assurance purposes. After hearing this message, should you decide to continue with the call, your consent to record the call is implied. Otherwise, you may contact a Bell customer service representative through our <a href="/Customer_service/Contact_us">contact us</a> section or by visiting a Bell store in your area.</p>
<p>The Bell companies may also record outbound calls placed to our customers for similar purposes.</p><br><p class="lastUpdateTag">Last Update:30/06/2011</p><div class="clearer"><!-- --></div><br><h2>How does Bell respect children‚Äôs privacy online?</h2>

<p><strong>What privacy enhancing services does Bell offer?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bell.ca/Home_phone/Calling_features/Control_your_calls.tab">Bell offers a number of services</a>, such as Call Display, Call Privacy and Call Blocking, to help balance the privacy interests of customers and the people they call.

<p><strong>Bell's Voice Identification service</strong></p>
<p>Using the unique characteristics of a customer‚Äôs voice, the Voice Identification service (VIS) from Bell quickly identifies you, enabling our agents to focus on what really matters ‚Äì your question.</p>
<p>Before you can benefit from this free service, you must register a sample of your voice. Registering for the Voice Identification service is simple and takes about two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Call </strong><strong>1 888 383-6817</strong><strong> today to register a sample of your voice.</strong> You‚Äôll also have a chance to register for VIS the next time you call <strong>310-BELL</strong> (2355). Have your bill handy so that you can provide your account number.</p>
<p>To get a sample of your voice, the system will ask you to repeat ‚ÄúAt Bell, my voice is my password‚Äù up to 4 times. You can allow others to access to your account by having them record their own voice samples.</p>
<p>Once you‚Äôve registered, and after you‚Äôve entered your phone number, you can simply repeat the phrase you‚Äôve recorded. The service will compare your voice to the recorded voice sample to check for a match. When your voice is matched with your recorded sample, you‚Äôll have immediate access to your account information through Self Serve or by speaking to an agent.</p>
<p>The Voice Identification service is currently available for Bell Home phone clients.</p><br><p class="lastUpdateTag">Last Update:30/06/2011</p><div class="clearer"><!-- --></div><br><h2>National Do Not Call list</h2>

<p>Every day, scam artists from around the world are finding new ways, and using the latest technology, to break into office networks or personal computers, or invent new phone or online scams in order to steal information and money from unsuspecting consumers.</p>
<p>Because of the variety and sheer volume of these activities, it is virtually impossible to track every incident or find the source of every fake marketing operation. As a result, more and more consumers and businesses are becoming victims of fraud and losing millions every year.</p>
<p><strong>Education is your best protection</strong></p>
<p>We encourage you to find out more about phishing (email fraud), telemarketing scams and other types of activities that can make you vulnerable. Below, are some examples of what you should be looking out for, as well as some tips that will help you stay safe online and offline.</p>
<p><strong>Telemarketing or prize scams </strong></p>
<p>Look out for aggressive marketing tactics, pressure to ‚Äúact now,‚Äù instructions to pay administrative fees for the delivery of a prize or product, etc. Aggressive marketing tactics are often used in order to ‚Äúclose the deal‚Äù, enabling the scam artist to quickly obtain your money and important information such as your banking information or credit card number.</p>
<p><strong>Important tip:</strong> Watch out for ‚Äúsuspiciously generous‚Äù offers and make sure you are dealing with a legitimate business when you make a purchase over the phone or the Internet. Very short offer-expiry dates are often a sign of a scam. Short expiries reduce the risk of the fraudster being traced by authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of our customers have had calls from fraudulent telemarketing ‚Äúoperators‚Äù claiming to be from Bell. For example, the operators may try to sell new rate plans (which are phony) or they may tell you that they‚Äôre updating your account and want you to ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù details. Their goal is to trick you into releasing personal information like credit card numbers or social insurance numbers, which can then be used for further fraud. Another example is the use of a pre-recorded message promising customers travel rewards or a $100 credit on their next bill and directing customers to a fake site that ‚Äúlooks‚Äù like a legitimate site or a 1-800 number to try to trick customers into disclosing their personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you get a suspicious call:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not give out your personal information. Legitimate companies will never call or email their customers requesting information such as passwords, bank account information or a credit card number, unless they are responding directly to an inquiry you know you have made. </li>
<li>If you suspect that you are speaking with a fraudulent telemarketer, you should end the call and contact the business or organization through its regular channels, for example, <strong>310-BELL (2355)</strong>. </li>
<li>Beware of being directed to websites that ‚Äúlook‚Äù like the sites from legitimate organizations ‚Äì it is always best to access the site of a legitimate organization from its direct homepage, e.g. bell.ca. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Email fraud or phishing </strong></p>
<p>This refers to the use of deceptive emails and fake websites using the brand name of a legitimate business or government agency in order to obtain the personal information of web users for purposes of identity theft and other types of fraud. For more information, go to the <a href="http://internet.bell.ca/index.cfm?method=content.view&amp;category_id=575&amp;content_id=6936">Bell Internet support site. </a></p>
<p><strong>Identity theft </strong></p>
<p>Scam artists are now using a wide range of tactics in order to steal your information online and offline. In addition to phishing, your personal information may be pulled from social networking sites, such as Facebook and MySpace, your computer, your mailbox and even your recycling bin.</p>
<p><strong>Important tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be cautious about posting personal information on public websites, such as social networking sites, as those details can be used by fraudsters to convince you that they represent Bell or other companies. </li>
<li>Keep your passwords, bank account information and social insurance number confidential at all times, and check your bank and credit card statements frequently. </li>
<li>Buy a shredder so you can destroy personal documents that you no longer need. You can be targeted for identity theft by fraud artists who find credit-card bills, etc., in your recycling. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Toll fraud </strong></p>
<p>Scam artists use creative schemes to steal your money by accessing your voice mail system, your calling card information or your Web browser and making sure the additional long distance fees are charged to you. Bell‚Äôs Fraud Control Centre continuously monitors its networks and works diligently to protect our customers and our employees.</p>

<p>Remember, it is your responsibility to remain vigilant and adopt the simple, but important safeguards that can protect you from toll fraud.</p>
<p><strong>Some important tips:</strong></p>
<p>The following are some important tips to help protect you from fraudulent activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be cautious with the information you provide over the phone and make sure no one is watching when keying in your calling card PIN or any other PIN. </li>
<li>Watch out for free downloads over the Web. Some sites will try to draw you in with free offers and then download programs that may be directing your Web browser to telephone an Internet service provider overseas. You could be charged the additional long distance fees. </li>
<li>Always check your monthly statements carefully and look out for unusual charges. </li>
<li>Beware of suspiciously generous offers or prizes from any company. </li>
<li>Look out for aggressive marketing tactics, pressure to ‚Äúact now,‚Äù instructions to pay administrative fees for the delivery of a prize or product, etc. </li>
<li>Very short offer-expiry dates are often a sign of a scam. Short expiries reduce the risk of the fraudster being traced by authorities. </li>
<li>Buy a shredder so you can destroy personal documents that you no longer need. You can be targeted for identity theft by fraud artists who find credit-card bills, etc., in your recycling. </li>
