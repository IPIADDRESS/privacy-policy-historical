<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
"Fashionfreax" constitutes the services set forth in this contract and/or the Empora Group GmbH. This Privacy Policy
supplements the "Terms of Use of the Fashionfreax".
</p>
<p>
Delicate and responsible handling of the individual-related data of all users is an issue of extreme importance to
Fashionfreax. All laws and regulations regarding privacy are meticulously complied with by Fashionfreax. These data
privacy laws mainly include the data privacy regulations of the TMG (German Act for Telemedia Services), the BDSG
(Federal Data Protection Act), the data privacy regulations of the TKG §§ 85 ff. (German Telecommunications Act) and
the legal provisions specified by the EU.
</p>
<p>
The following Privacy Policy gives information about how the protection and the security of all individual-related
data at Fashionfreax is ensured according to the currently effective statutory regulations.
</p>
<h2>1. Individual-related data</h2>
<h3>1.1 Information required for registration</h3>
<p>
Fashionfreax is a social network. As does any network among people, Fashionfreax relies on the principle that its
users, communicate, to a certain extent, information about themselves to the other users which is also accurate.
That is in fact the only way a network such as fashiofreax.net can function. Therefore, right from the start, i.e.
while registering, all users are asked to provide the following information about themselves:
</p>
<ul>
<li>User name</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Password and password repetition</li>
<li>City</li>
<li>Country</li>
</ul>
<p>
Only individual parts of this information is made accessible to other users, namely:
</p>
<ul>
<li>User name</li>
<li>City</li>
<li>Country</li>
</ul>
<p>
The remaining information, i. e. email address and the password only serve administrative purposes of the user
account by Fashionfreax. Of course, the password remains confidential and is encrypted. The user can approve private
information for friends.
</p>
<h3>1.2 Voluntary information</h3>
<p>
Furthermore, there are numerous opportunities for users to voluntarily provide additional information about
themselves in the various categories of Fashionfreax (e.g. favourite designer, handbag contents, geodata, etc.).
Although this information is not required, it can be helpful and useful in contacting other users. Each user
independently decides as he/she sees fit, which information he/she would like to provide and which not.
</p>
<h3>1.3 Degree of privacy in the profile</h3>
<p>
By means of the personal settings in your own profile, there is also the opportunity of only making certain
information accessible to a specific group of people (friends).
</p>
<h2>2. Purpose</h2>
<h3>2.1 Collection, storage, processing</h3>
<p>
The collection, storage, processing and application of the individual-related data stated above under item 1. by
Fashionfreax is effected according to the legal provisions (in particular of the §§ 12 ff. TMG -German Act for
Telemedia Services and §§ 28, 29 ff. BDSG - Federal Data Protection Act).
</p>
<h3>2.2 Intended uses</h3>
<p>
Fashionfreax uses the collected data for the following purposes, whereas not all data is actually used for all
purposes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The data provided by the user during registration (item 1.1) is used by Fashionfreax for the grounds and
administration of the contractual relationship.
</li>
<li>
The data which accumulates while using the Fashionfreax platform is used by Fashionfreax for the provision
of the services offered by Fashionfreax.
</li>
<li>
To continuously improve the services of Fashionfreax, e. g. to establish new categories or offers, for
advertising purposes and market research, Fashionfreax can analyse the behaviour of its users in the network
and create pseudonymised user profiles, provided that the user has not exercised his/her legal rights and
objected to this use. This enables Fashionfreax e.g. to find out on which days and at what time of day the
offers of the Fashionfreax websites are particularly popular and how much data volume is created on the
Fashionfreax websites. Furthermore, by using the log files Fashionfreax can recognise possible errors, e.g.
inaccurate links or programme errors and therefore, use the log files for the enhancement of the
Fashionfreax websites. Under no circumstances does the evaluation of these user profiles take place using
individual-related data, i.e. the user's identity remains unknown. In any case, Fashionfreax ensures that
according to technical as well as personal and organisational aspects the pseudonymised user profiles are
not consolidated with the users' personal data (§ 15 subsection 3 TMG - German Act for Telemedia
Services).
</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. No data is transferred to third parties</h2>
<p>
Fashionfreax does not transfer its users individual-related data to third parties unless the user has previously
given his/her explicit consent or there is a legal obligation to transfer data. As far as the user has given his/her
consent, he/she can revoke it at any time with effect for the future by means of brief notification (email, fax,
letter).
</p>
<h2>4. Cookies</h2>
<p>
Cookies are small text files which are either temporarily filed in the main memory or permanently saved on the hard
drive ("session Cookie" or "permanent Cookie"). Session Cookies are not saved on the user's hard drive but rather
expire automatically when the Internet browser is closed. The users are assigned anonymous user IDs by the placement
of Cookies but in no case are programmes carried out on the users' computers or let alone computer viruses
transmitted.<br>
Fashionfreax uses Cookies for the authentication of the user during login. The application of Cookies serves the
purpose of guaranteeing smooth operation and improving the services of Fashionfreax.<br>
Using the settings of their Internet browser programme, all users can decide for themselves whether they choose to
accept Cookies, to be informed each time Cookies are placed or to object to all Cookies. However, Fashionfreax
points out that the use of the Fashionfreax offers is not possible if Cookies are not accepted.
</p>
<h2>5. Server Log Files</h2>
<p>
Each time a page is accessed by a user, his/her Internet browser transmits access data which is automatically stored
in so-called server log files by Fashionfreax. Fashionfreax cannot readily attribute this data to specific
individuals. A consolidation of this data with other data sources, in particular with the individual-related user
data, does not take place. To maintain the database Fashionfreax creates so-called backups which in each case are
overwritten after approx. four weeks and are thus irrevocably deleted. As far as these backups contain server log
files, these are also deleted. In the case of a complete deletion of a user profile the server log files are also
deleted. The server log files contain the following information: IP address with which the computer (however not the
user) can be identified, remote host (name and IP address of the computer which requested the site), time, status,
amount of transferred data and the Internet site from which the user accessed the requested site (referrer), product
and version information of the used browser (user agent). For this purpose Fashionfreax uses the standardised
"combined" logfile format of the Apache webserver.<br>
However, Fashionfreax reserves the right to subsequently inspect the logfiles using the last known IP address of
such Fashionfreax members who, due to concrete facts, are suspected of using these Fashionfreax websites and/or the
Fashionfreax services in an illegal manner or in a manner contrary to contract. This serves the protection of the
Fashionfreax members, the security of the Fashionfreax member data as well as the Fashionfreax websites and the

<h2>6. Data security (firewalls, antivirus technologies, etc.)</h2>
<p>
The firewalls applied and continuously updated by Fashionfreax and other security systems are to protect the users
against viruses and unauthorised external access to the Fashionfreax as far as possible. Fashionfreax is obligated
to maintain an appropriate level of protection and to regularly adapt the applied security technologies to the
currently best available technology. Nevertheless, users should be aware of the fact that due to new viruses which
are constantly emerging and other means of attacking secured data systems of Internet services, a one hundred
percent reliable protection against attacks cannot be guaranteed. Fashionfreax is not responsible for antivirus
protection outside of the network. Fashionfreax is also not responsible for damage and destruction of data by
unknown viruses. Fashionfreax will take criminal and civil legal action against every detected attack by hackers and
the like.
</p>
<h2>7. Information</h2>
<p>
Every user has the right to receive free information from Fashionfreax regarding his/her stored individual-related
data. The request for information is to be sent to Fashionfreax in the written form. A notarised copy of an official
and valid ID card is to be attached to the information request. The information will be sent to the address
indicated on the user's ID card by mail.
</p>
<h2>8. Correction, deletion and blocking</h2>
<h3>8.1 Previous data</h3>
<p>
As far as the user alters or corrects information he/she has provided and in doing so deletes old entries, the data
previously entered by him/her is automatically completely deleted. An application for correction or deletion is not
required.
</p>
<h3>8.2 Correction of data</h3>
<p>
Regardless of that, users have the right to demand the correction of incorrect data which is stored on them at
Fashionfreax at all times. But the easiest alternative for users is to change their entries accordingly by
themselves.
</p>
<h3>8.3 End of membership</h3>
<p>
As far as users have irrevocably deleted their profile and in doing so ended their membership at Fashionfreax, all
data which has previously been entered by them is automatically completely deleted. An application for deletion is
not required.
</p>
<h3>8.4 Deletion</h3>
<p>
Regardless of that, users have the right to demand the deletion of all of their collected individual-related data
which is stored on them at Fashionfreax at all times. In this case however, the easiest alternative is also for
users to delete their entries themselves.
</p>
<h3>8.5 Contact</h3>
<p>
As far as the user demands the alteration, correction or deletion of his/her individual-related data, this can be
effected via email, fax or letter. The request must at least contain the following information for the correct
allocation:

<ul>
<li>Name, first name</li>

longer period of time.
