                                <p>Subscribers are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for
                                FastDomain services including name, postal address, email address, telephone number, and
                                billing information (such as a credit card number). In addition, to register a domain name,
                                Subscribers are asked to provide this information for the registrant, administrative contact,
                                technical contact and billing contact of the domain name (collectively, "Domain Name Registration

                                Subscribers may also be asked to complete an online form that collects information about

                                <p>FastDomain's website includes social media features (such as the Facebook "Like"
                                button). These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on our website,
                                and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets
                                may be hosted by a third party or directly on FastDomain's website. Your interactions with
                                these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the feature.</p>

                                <p>FastDomain uses different types of cookies (which are electronic collections of
                                information stored on a local computer that are used by websites to keep track of visitors and
                                registered users and to relate one computer transaction to a later one) and other methods of
                                uniquely tracking visitors for different purposes. For example, some cookies are "required cookies"
                                which are necessary for FastDomain's website to work. In addition, cookies are used to
                                provide FastDomain's existing Subscribers with the opportunity for continued savings and
                                increased convenience as described in more detail below.</p>

                                        <h3>Cookies for Improving Our Web Site.</h3>
                                        <p>FastDomain uses "performance cookies" to inform FastDomain of a repeat
                                        visit. However, these cookies do not tell FastDomain who a visitor is, the
                                        visitor's name, email address, or passwords.</p>

                                        <p>To offer FastDomain Subscribers continued savings, FastDomain uses
                                        cookies to help monitor the traffic generated from FastDomain banners and logo
                                        buttons displayed on FastDomain Subscribers' websites.</p>

                                        <h3>Cookies for Subscriber Account Management.</h3>
                                        <p>For FastDomain Subscribers, FastDomain uses "functional cookies" to
                                        store user names for added convenience. For example, the cookie would contain a piece of
                                        identifying information such as a customer ID, username, or session ID that would be used to
                                        look up the customer ID. FastDomain offers password-protected, web-based management
                                        tools as part of its webhosting packages. By storing a Subscriber's username in a cookie,
                                        the Subscriber will not have to fill out form fields each time he or she manages the
                                        account. (The cookie does not store passwords.)</p>
                                    </li>

                                        <h3>Cookies for Advertising.</h3>
                                        <p>FastDomain may also utilize "advertising cookies" to track referrals from
                                        internal and external affiliates, as well as advertising campaigns. FastDomain may
                                        also use a third party service provider to send emails that you have agreed to receive.
                                        Pixel tags and cookies may be used in those email messages to help FastDomain
                                        measure the effectiveness of its advertising and to enable FastDomain to provide
                                        more focused marketing communications to you.</p>

                                able to take advantage of all of the features of FastDomain's website. Additionally, please

                                <p>FastDomain may periodically conduct customer surveys. Participation in our customer
                                surveys is voluntary. However, we encourage Subscribers to participate in these surveys because they
                                provide FastDomain with important information that helps improve the types of services we
                                offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information, if provided, will remain
                                confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party service provider on our behalf.</p>

                                <p>The information collected from Subscribers is used to manage each Subscriber's account (such as
                                for billing and account management purposes) and to promote other products or services that
                                FastDomain believes may be of interest to its Subscribers. FastDomain may also
                                generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from information that Subscribers provide during
                                registration (such as the total number of Subscribers in a given category, but not their names).
                                As explained in more detail below, FastDomain may in certain instances use this
                                aggregated and non-identifying information to promote advertisements that appear on
                                FastDomain's website and in connection with its services. Any such aggregated and
                                non-identifying information that FastDomain collects, and any analysis of such
                                information that it produces, is proprietary information of FastDomain.</p>

                                addresses) to help diagnose problems with FastDomain servers, and to administer and
                                optimize FastDomain's website. FastDomain also gathers broad demographic
                                information from this data to help improve its website and make your browsing and purchasing

                                partners who work with or on behalf of FastDomain, and are subject to specific
                                confidentiality agreements, FastDomain will not provide or sell to any third party your

                                following:</p>

                                <p>Upon registration for FastDomain services, certain Subscriber information may be
                                transferred to trusted affiliated or unaffiliated third parties that help FastDomain
                                provide certain services or that provide certain services on FastDomain's behalf. For
                                example, Subscriber information may be transferred to FastDomain's affiliated registrar,
                                FastDomain (WHOIS Domain Name Registration Information), or to unaffiliated third parties that help
                                FastDomain provide email services or SSL certifications.</p>

                                <p>Some services are offered or promoted in conjunction with a FastDomain partner or
                                sponsor. For example, FastDomain may partner with other corporate affiliates of Endurance
                                or with trusted non-affiliated partners for co-promotions of a particular product or service.
                                FastDomain may share certain Subscriber contact information but no billing information with
                                FastDomain's partner or sponsor in order to provide the relevant services or to run the
                                promotion. If FastDomain shares Subscriber information with partners and sponsors,
                                FastDomain requires that they maintain the Subscriber information in confidence, and use the
                                information solely for purposes of providing the services or carrying out the agreed upon
                                promotion.</p>

                                <p>FastDomain does not share personally identifiable information about individual users
                                with advertisers. FastDomain may display online advertisements and share aggregated and
                                non-identifying information about Subscribers collected through the registration process or through
                                online surveys and promotions with certain advertisers. This aggregated and non-identifying
                                information may be used to deliver tailored advertisements. For example, an advertiser may tell
                                FastDomain the audience it wants to reach (e.g., males between 25 and 55 years of age) and
                                provide FastDomain with an advertisement tailored to that audience. Based upon the
                                aggregated and non-identifying information collected by FastDomain, FastDomain may
                                then display the advertisement to the intended audience.</p>

                                above, FastDomain may share aggregated, non-personally identifying information obtained

                                involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations or suspected violations

                                <p>In certain jurisdictions or pursuant to the rules of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
                                and Numbers ("ICANN") or certain registries, Domain Name Registration Information has to be made
                                available and accessible to the public through a "WHOIS" search. The WHOIS database is a publicly
                                accessible database that lists the Domain Name Registration Information for a particular domain
                                name, the name server(s) to which the domain name points, and the domain name's creation and
                                expiration date. The Domain Name Registration Information you provide is hosted by FastDomain
                                or a third party service provider and is made available to the public through WHOIS searches.
                                FastDomain may deposit your Domain Name Registration Information with a third-party escrow
                                provider to comply with ICANN requirements. At times, Subscribers may receive solicitations that
                                result from searches of the publicly available WHOIS database by other companies or individuals. Any
                                such solicitations or SPAM do not come from FastDomain and FastDomain does not
                                control the use of WHOIS information by third parties.</p>

                                FastDomain and may result in deactivation of your domain name and disclosure of your contact
                                information so that any allegations of infringement or other wrongdoing may be directly resolved
