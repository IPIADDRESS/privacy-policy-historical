      <p>Thank you for visiting the FASTSPRING ("FASTSPRING") Internet
        web site located under the URL at: www.FASTSPRING.com ("Site").
        We are pleased to provide this privacy policy. FASTSPRING highly respects
        the privacy of our customers, partners, and clients, and we take the
        issue of your privacy very seriously. </p>
      <h2>What we collect and how we use it</h2>
      <p>FASTSPRING asks that customers supply certain personal data when placing
        orders, including name, physical address, email address, and credit card
        information. This data is used only for the purpose of fulfilling orders
        or communicating with customers, partners, or suppliers regarding orders. </p>
      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>We use small text files called cookies to improve the overall Site experience.
        FASTSPRING's cookies are used only to identify the customer, not to identify

      <h2>Sharing Personal Information</h2>
      <p>FASTSPRING may share your personal information with partners or suppliers
        in order for them to fulfill the service or product you have ordered.
        This may include the maker or provider of the product you have purchased,
        companies used to process credit card or other payment types, deliver
        packages, provide customer service, or otherwise provide services that
        enable us to serve you. These organizations will have access only to
        the information required to permit them to perform their obligations
        to us. </p>
      <p>Beyond these mentioned disclosures, we will only disclose your personally
        identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to
        do so by law, regulation or other government authority, to prevent harm
        to yourself or others, or to protect against fraud. We may transfer your
        personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger,
        consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which FASTSPRING participates
        or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of FASTSPRING's assets.
        Such successor entity shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this
        privacy policy.</p>

        with the demands of customer service. Such measures are reasonably designed
        to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized
        access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Where reasonably practical,
        FASTSPRING uses SSL and other encryption, password protection, firewalls,
        internal restrictions and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized
        access to your personally identifiable information.</p>
