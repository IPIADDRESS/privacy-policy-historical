<p>In their use of our services, Customers submit content, configurations and credentials to the Fastly edge cloud services to be processed.

Our terms of service are available <a href="https://www.fastly.com/terms">here</a>. Our data processing terms are available <a href="https://www.fastly.com/data-processing">here</a>. To the extent a Customer submits to the services the personal information of European persons, Fastly processes that personal information as a data processor or as the Customer’s sub-processor (as the case may be).
Customers are solely responsible for establishing the policies governing, and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations related to, the Customer’s (and the Customer’s Internet client’s) collection and submission of personal data to our services.

<p>Fastly acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. Fastly has no direct relationship with the data subjects whose personal data we process on behalf of our Customers.

In addition, we will forward to the applicable Customer any request by a data subject received by Fastly regarding personal data processed on behalf of that Customer. If requested to remove data, we will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
