<p>In their use of our services, Customers submit content, configurations and credentials to the Fastly edge cloud services to be processed.

Our terms of service are available <a href="https://www.fastly.com/terms">here</a>. Our data processing terms are available <a href="https://www.fastly.com/data-processing">here</a>. To the extent a Customer submits to the services the personal information of European persons (including the United Kingdom and Switzerland), Fastly processes that personal information as a data processor or as the Customer’s sub-processor (as the case may be).
Customers are solely responsible for establishing the policies governing, and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations related to, the Customer’s (and the Customer’s Internet client’s) collection and submission of personal data to our services. Any personal information about an individual (i.e., a “data subject”) hosted, stored or published by a Customer is the responsibility of the Customer and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Fastly acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. Fastly has no direct relationship with the data subjects whose personal data we process on behalf of our Customers. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend or delete inaccurate data should direct their requests or queries to our Customer (i.e., the data controller). In addition, we will forward to the applicable Customer any request by a data subject received by Fastly regarding personal data processed on behalf of that Customer. If requested to remove data, we will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how we collect, use, disclose, and protect the personal information (or, alternatively, “personal data”) of our Visitors, Customers and Attendees, as well as the choices available to you regarding that information. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Fastly has certified its services under the EU–U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union and Switzerland, respectively (collectively, the “Privacy Shield”).
