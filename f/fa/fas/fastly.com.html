<p>Published on:&nbsp;November 27, 2019</p>

<h2>1. INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE</h2>

<p>This privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) covers and describes how Fastly, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Fastly”, “We” or “Us”) collect, use, share, secure and disclose the personal data we collect from individuals who interact with www.fastly.com and our websites that link to this Privacy Policy or who initiate communications with us (“Visitors”), individuals who register for or authenticate to our edge cloud services (“Customers”), individuals who register for or attend our marketing events or receive our marketing emails (“Attendees”) and individuals who submit an application for a career opportunity at Fastly (“Job Applicants”).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our websites, apps and services are designed for businesses and their representatives. We do not target consumers – individuals who seek to use products and services for their personal or household use.&nbsp; Accordingly, we treat all personal data we collect as pertaining to individuals in their business capacity and not their individual capacity.</p>

<p><em>Our Edge Cloud Services/Fastly as a Data Processor or Service Provider.</em></p>

<p>In their use of our services, Customers submit content, configurations and credentials to the Fastly edge cloud services to be processed. The security and privacy practices governing our Customers’ (and our Customers’ Internet clients’) use of our services and how we store, process, transmit and disclose the data submitted to the services by our Customers are described in and governed by our service contracts with our Customers. Our terms of service are available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastly.com/terms">here</a>. Our data processing terms are available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastly.com/data-processing">here</a>. To the extent a Customer submits to the services the personal data of European persons (including the United Kingdom and Switzerland) or other persons who are protected by similar data privacy laws, Fastly processes that personal data as a data processor or as the Customer’s sub-processor (as the case may be). Customers are solely responsible for establishing the policies governing, and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations related to, the Customer’s (and the Customer’s Internet client’s) collection and submission of personal data to our services. Any personal data about an individual (i.e., a “data subject”) hosted, stored or published by a Customer is the responsibility of the Customer and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Fastly acknowledges that you may have the right to access your personal data. Fastly has no direct relationship with the data subjects whose personal data we process on behalf of our Customers. An individual who seeks to access, correct, amend, or delete personal data about them that we process on behalf of our Customers should direct their requests or queries to our Customer (i.e., the data controller.
