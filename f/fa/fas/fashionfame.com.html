But his grand gestures are backed up by incredible and farfetched attention to detail and tailoring. Born in 1969, in the East End, and son of a London cabbie, he began to work as an apprentice cutter on Savile Row at the age of16. After a temporary stay in Milan, cutting patterns for Romeo Gigli, McQueen enrolled at Central Saint Martins.

In 1994, his graduate collection caught the eye of late fashion stylist Isabella Blow, who purchased it for $7,750 and became his champion. The following year, McQueen cemented his rising-star status with hackle-raising Highland Rape collection, featuring tattered dresses, bloodstained models, and his notoriously low-cut &quot;bumster&quot; pants. In 1996, Givenchy appointed McQueen as it's chief designer. But his reign there was a tumultuous one and ended in 2001, a few months after the Gucci Group bought a 51% stake in his own label.

McQueen has since expanded into menswear, accessories, eyewear, fragrance, and he has launched a second line, McQ. His Spring 2008 show was a tribute to his fashion mentor, Issy Blow, who died in May 2007. He's won all the big fashion awards given out there in London and was even honored by Queen Elizabeth as Commander of the British Empire in 2003.">Alexander McQueen</a>

Sui has called on a crazy quilt of inspirations for years such as the New York Dolls, Pre-Raphaelite paintings, the American West, Uzbekistan, etc. Above all the noise, Sui manages to hit the key trends every season.

She was born in Detroit to French-educated Chinese emigrants in 1964. A flea-market junkie, she idolized youthful dreams of stitching clothes for rock royalty like Anita Pallenberg, and landed in New York with a scholarship to Parsons. After only two years, she ditched class and dove headfirst into the industry, learning the ropes designing for sportswear labels and styling for photographer Steven Meisel, on shoots.

In 1980, she brought her collection of six pieces to the Boutique Show, which is aNew York's trade fair, and caught the eye of a Macy's buyer; a Christmas window and an ad in The New York Times followed. The next decade, Sui produced and ran her business out of her apartment, and step up to real runway in 1991. A year later she opened her boutique in Soho, crammed to the rafters with Victorian punk. Today Sui is running more than 30 boutiques worldwide.">Anna Sui</a>

The collection was named Piano Piano Dolce Carlotta, after the Robert Aldrich horror movie of 1960s. 

He won the Contemporary Linen prize for a wedding dress that revealed Sardinian influence which is now his trademark. In 1992, he decided to concentrate on one collection and finally made his haute couture debut under his own name in Paris in 1996. He presented his first eponymous ready-to-wear collection in Milan in 1999, with the shapes and colors of Sardinian costume again a major influence, together with Byzantine symbolism.

A book of photographs by Richard Avedon which he discovered in adolescence, was what convinced him to get into fashion. A graduate of Esmod in Paris, he was artistic director of ready-to-wear Paco Rabanne, for seven years and consultant for various French brands.

He was appointed as the creative director of Balmain in 2005. For a label that was once known for its ultra-elegant evening attires with draping and pleating focus, Decarnin's appointment took it toward tough-chic, thigh-grazing, and body-skimming looks. These looks created a sensibility that embraces quintessential trend-setting French party-girl.

 Owner of the House of Balmain, Alain Hivelin claims that sales have doubled since Decarnin's appointment, projecting 2009 to amass $28 million in revenue, where the clothes are notoriously expensiveâa sparkly tee is $3,000, dresses are $12,000 to $22,000, and jackets are $5,000.">Christophe Decarnin</a>

As a young lad in Scotland, Christopher Kane grew up worshiping Gianni Versace and his loud, bodyâhugging looks. While studying in London's Central St. Martins College of Art and Design, Kane worked for fellow designers Russell Sage and Giles Deacon and attracted the attention of Donatella Versace by winning LancÃ´me Colour Award in 2005. So was surprisingly amazed, as he was handpicked by his late idol's sister, Donatella, to consult on Versace label in Milan.

Kane debuted his own collection for spring 2007 in London, with an eyeâpopping parade of ultrashort bandage dresses in searing neon brights that earned him tag of next âIt Britâ designer. But the 24âyearâold sensation is no flash in the pan. Kane's fall followâup of goth mini-frocks in sculpted, crystal studded leather and velvet earned him even more raves. He recently unveiled a new cashmere line for spring 2010; and his close relationship with sister Tammy, who serves him as partner, model, and muse that reminds us of another wildly successful brotherâsister duo we know.

With her impressive CV and innovatory approach to knitwear she has reinvented the brand since she was appointed its creative director in 2005. Having been taught by her mother, she began knitting at the age of five. She then went on to study at Ravensbourne College of Art, where she completed her graduation in fashion, and completed her MA in Fashion Knitwear at The Royal College of Art.

Having secured her job working on womenswear at Calvin Klein, she targeted New York as her next destination. This was followed by a role at Ralph Lauren, which saw her working as senior designer of Purple Label Menswear and gave her a fantastic knowledge about tailoring - something that she still draws upon today. In 2000, she was hired by Tom Ford at Gucci to work alongside Christopher Bailey and Francisco Costa as a senior designer. And, this was further followed by her role as creative director of Pringle of Scotland in 2005. Clare was told to completely reinvent the brand, which she did, presenting her first collection in February 2006.

She was honored as the Scottish Cashmere Designer of the Year at the Scottish Fashion Awards in 2007. She also launched Pringle 1815, a diffusion line named which was named after the year company was founded.">Clare Waight Keller</a>

Her older sister Robyn is the star of cult-hit movie Teen Witch and brother Eric starred in Disney Channel hit show &quot;So Weird&quot;. So it was very natural that Blake would head that direction as well. She led a very normal life, by attending Burbank High School in CA and participated in Choir. She juggled AP courses and soon became student council president.

Her very first movie role was a small role as Trixie in Sandman in 1998. But her very first leading role came in 2005 as Bridget Vreeland in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. She had no real experience in the film industry, so she just walked in for the audition, handed her photo and left. The casting directors were floored, obviously. But they admitted to each other that she was perfect for the part and gave it to her. This role placed her with other hot young Hollywood stars such as Amber Tamblyn, America Ferrera, and Alexis Bledel.

In the year 2006, Blake landed roles in teen movie Accepted, Simon Says, and a small role in Elvis and Anabelle. In 2007, she made her most important role to date - as the glamorous and envied Serena van der Woodsen in the CW's &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;. The show received an impressive 3 million viewers for its first showing and has maintained about that much ever since.">Blake Lively</a>

The manufacturer Audemars Piguet produces 26000 watches each year and offers a broad range encompassing watches with complex movements, jewelry watches and a line of  jewelry. It cultivates a firmly independent status by pursuing brand development through selective investments in terms of distribution, industrialization and its retail network.

When founders Audemars and Piguet died in 1918 and 1919 respectively, the company showed a regular growth and became more famous. As the success of company's business was rising its customers became Cartier, Tiffany &amp; Co, and Bvlgari, who re-branded and sold Audemars Piguet watches under their own house names. Today these watches are only identifiable and known as Audemars Piguet products by their serial numbers.

Like many other luxury watch brands, Audemars Piguet has a number of brand ambassadors, such as Indian Cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, Indonesian-French singer Anggun, and Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh, as well personalities and teams in different sport categories such as cricket, golf, softball, motor sports, skiing, and sailing.">Audemars Piguet</a>
