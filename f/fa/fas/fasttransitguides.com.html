				<h1>LEGAL: Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective January 1 2014</strong></p>

</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES REFERRED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. 
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to fasttransitguides.com' collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by fasttransitguides.com on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the "Website"), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to fasttransitguides.com' other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. fasttransitguides.com is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.

</p>
<p>1. Collection of Information. 
</p>
<p>1.1 Information Collection By Survey. 
</p>
<p>Fasttransitguides.com collects information, personal and otherwise, from individuals primarily by having the individuals provide that information directly to fasttransitguides.com through its surveys and other opportunities to share information. Information collection may happen by various methods, including, but not limited to, an individual who transmits or receives a message through a fasttransitguides.com web site by any means including, but not limited to posts and text messages, when an individual supplies a photo, when an individual voluntarily completes a fasttransitguides.com survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by fasttransitguides.com or third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used in this policy, "online" means using the Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, fasttransitguides.com or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to fasttransitguides.com, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, photo, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). fasttransitguides.com may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and use that information in combination with information provided from this Web Site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to fasttransitguides.com or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from fasttransitguides.com or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to fasttransitguides.com. 
</p>
<p>1.2 Third Party List Information. 
</p>
<p>Fasttransitguides.com may collect information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and fasttransitguides.com subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information, fasttransitguides.com seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to fasttransitguides.com and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list. 
</p>
<p>1.3 Other Information. 
</p>
<p>Other occasions when fasttransitguides.com obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by fasttransitguides.com or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through fasttransitguides.com's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a fasttransitguides.com service or newsletter (together, "Other Information"). 
</p>
<p>1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology. 
</p>
<p>Fasttransitguides.com currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, fasttransitguides.com may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information"). 
</p>
<p>(a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows fasttransitguides.com to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in fasttransitguides.com's database. You may read more about cookies at <span class="markup markup_underline markup_underline_link markup_underline_link_text">http://cookiecentral.com</span></p>. Individuals who use the Website need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Website. 
<p></p>
<p>(b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an  programming function (see <span class="markup markup_underline markup_underline_link markup_underline_link_text">http://truste.org</span></p> for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows fasttransitguides.com to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, fasttransitguides.com might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where baseball products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in fasttransitguides.com's database, visits the baseball website, fasttransitguides.com receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the baseball site, and fasttransitguides.com would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in baseball. fasttransitguides.com may thereafter present offers of baseball related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, fasttransitguides.com also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in fasttransitguides.com's database. 
<p></p>
<p>(c) New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, including search engine indexing, cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is fasttransitguides.com's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, fasttransitguides.com strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.
