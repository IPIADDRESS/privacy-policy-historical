<p><strong>5. SECURITY AND PRIVACY MEASURES</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.1 How does Fastly protect my information and data?</strong><br>
We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.</p>
<p>Information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any sensitive information is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) (sometimes referred to as Secure Sockets Layer or SSL).</p>
<p>You must also make sure that your information is safe and secure. Even if we give you (or you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. Do not share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of our Websites, for example, message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of our Websites.</p>
<p>Information that is transmitted via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Websites. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible if you circumvent any privacy settings or security measures on our Websites.</p>
<p><strong>5.2 How does Fastly limit access to my personal information?</strong><br>
We limit access to certain pages on our Websites and allow you to set certain privacy settings via your account profile; however, be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.</p>
<p>Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users of our Websites with whom you may choose to share your user contributions. Given that, we cannot and do not guarantee that your user contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.</p>
<p><strong>6. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p><strong>7. Fastly Services</strong>.<br>
Fastly subscribers electronically submit (or cause to be submitted) data to the Services for caching, transmission, and associated processing, and Fastly caches, transmits, and processes data only as provided in our subscription agreements with our subscribers, such as our Terms of Service available at <a href="https://www.fastly.com/terms">https://www.fastly.com/terms</a>. Additional information about our privacy and security practices with respect to our Services is available at <a href="https://docs.fastly.com/">https://docs.fastly.com</a>.</p>
<p>As the subscribers (or in some cases their internet clients) control the data to be cached, transmitted, and/or processed, Fastly’s network, platform, and services may be used as a conduit for information. As the Privacy Shield Framework does not impose secondary liability, to the extent Fastly, on behalf of a subscriber, merely transmits, routes, switches, or caches data, Fastly may rely on its subscribers to comply with legal requirements underlying the Privacy Shield Framework or other frameworks with respect to such processing.</p>
<p><strong>7.1 Information Related to Data Collected Through our Services</strong><br>
The use of personal information collected through our Services at the direction of our subscribers shall be limited to the purpose of providing the Services for which the subscriber has engaged Fastly. Although Fastly collects information related to subscriber personnel as they configure a subscriber’s use of our Services, Fastly has no direct relationship with individuals whose personal information is collected, cached, or transmitted by the Services. subscribers are responsible for complying with any regulations or laws that require providing notice, disclosure, and/or obtaining consent prior to transferring the data to Fastly for processing purposes. Fastly also collects, uses and discloses personal information of individuals who visit our websites and applications (“Visitors”) and individual representatives of our customers, suppliers, and business partners (“Business Contacts”). Personal information associated with Visitors and Business Contacts is collected, stored, and processed in accordance with Fastly’s Privacy Policy outside of this Section 7.</p>
<p>IP addresses may be considered personal information under certain circumstances. You can review how Fastly collects, uses, and retains IP addresses in our security and compliance documentation at <a href="https://docs.fastly.com/guides/security-measures/">https://docs.fastly.com/guides/security-measures/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>7.2 Choice</strong></p>
<p>Our Services collect information for our subscribers. As a data processor of this information on our subscriber’s behalf, Fastly has limited ability to access information our subscribers submit to our services. If you are a data subject for whom a subscriber has submitted personal information to the Services and would like your information not to be disclosed to a third party or to be used for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which the personal information was originally collected, then you should contact the subscriber directly. &nbsp;Concerns with personal information cached or transmitted by Fastly at the direction of our subscribers may be reported according to our acceptable use policy available at <a href="http://www.fastly.com/acceptable-use">https://www.fastly.com/acceptable-use</a>. We will refer your requests to the appropriate subscriber.</p>
<p><strong>7.3 Accountability for Onward Transfer</strong><br>
Fastly is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Fastly may use from time to time third-party service providers, contractors and subprocessors to assist in providing the Services on our behalf. Fastly maintains contracts with these third parties restricting their access, use and disclosure of personal information in compliance with our Privacy Shield obligations, and Fastly may be liable if we fail to meet those obligations and we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
<p><strong>7.4 Security</strong><br>
Fastly maintains administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect data submitted to the Services, including personal information. These security measures are set forth in our documentation available at <a href="https://docs.fastly.com/guides/security-measures/">https://docs.fastly.com/guides/security-measures/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>7.5 Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation</strong><br>
As a data processor, Fastly caches, transmits, discloses and processes data, which may include personal information about EU personnel received from its subscribers and their users, at the direction of its subscribers in accordance with our agreements. Fastly may process data to provide the Services, to prevent or address technical or service problems, to follow the instructions of our customer who submitted the personal information, or in response to contractual or legal requirements. Fastly does not control or own the data submitted by its subscribers, or their internet clients, to the Services. Fastly may share personal information with its subsidiaries, contractors, or third parties if Fastly undergoes a business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition by another company or sale of all or a portion of its assets.</p>
<p><strong>7.6 Access to Data Controlled by our Subscribers</strong><br>
Fastly has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal information our Services process on behalf of our subscribers. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate personal information should direct his or her query to the appropriate subscriber (i.e., the data controller). Subscribers have the ability to fulfill these requests, and Fastly will provide assistance for requests that subscribers are not able to complete. If the subscriber requests that Fastly remove the personal information, we will refer your request to the applicable subscriber and we will respond to its request within 45 days.</p>
<p><strong>7.5 Data Retention</strong><br>
Fastly retains the personal information we process on behalf of our subscribers for as long as needed to provide Services to our subscribers. Fastly retains and uses this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<p><strong>7.6 U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Framework</strong><br>
Fastly complies with the U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from Switzerland.
