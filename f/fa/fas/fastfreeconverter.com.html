                        <br>
                        Collection of Personal Information <br>
                        Certain types of personally identifiable information may and will be automatically collected by
                        the Company in regards to both your computer hardware and software. Such personally identifiable
                        information may include: browser type, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, domain names,
                        referring web page addresses and times of access. The aforementioned information that is
                        collected by the Company is used by such to operate the service, maintain the quality thereof,

                        improvement. <br>
                        <br>
                        The Company consistently keeps track of any web pages and sections that are visited by our
                        customers within the Company, such that the Company may determine which of its services are of
                        greatest interest. Such data can and will be used to provide customers with content that of

                        been customized to cater to the customers' needs based upon their behavior on the web page. The

                        reports for internal usage; in no way will the Company ever use the aforementioned reports with
                        the intention of personally identifying any individual, unless it is in the event of deliberate

                        <br>
                        The Company will never, in any way, disclose the email addresses of our customers; such
                        identities are always kept confidential and are never sold to any third parties, such as bulk

                        The Company will never, in any way, disclose other such personal information, nor make it
                        available to the public, including postal mail addresses, phone numbers, or any other such

                        customers. In the event that English Law requires the Company to disclose any personal

                        necessity, the Company will disclose such information without providing any notice, under the
                        conditions that it is necessary to: (a) abide by any edits of the law or to abide by any other
                        such legal process that of which is served on the Company or its web page; (b) both protect and

                        such that the Company can protect the personal safety of either the users of the Company or the
                        public. <br>
                        <br>
                        Usage of Cookies <br>
                        The Company web page may and will utilize "cookies" for the purposes of personalizing your
                        experience in interaction. A cookie is defined to be a text file which is placed onto your hard
                        drive by a web page serve. A cookie cannot be used to either deliver viruses nor is it capable
                        of running programs without your prior consent. A cookie is uniquely assigned solely to you and
                        is only able to be read by an online server within the domain that of which assigned you the
                        cookie. <br>
                        <br>
                        Cookies primarily serve as convenience to the user, intending to save them time. Its purpose is
                        to inform a web server whether or not you have returned to a specific web page. For example,
                        should you personalize any of the pages on the Company web page or choose to register on such, a
                        cookie will help the Company web page in remembering specific information on any subsequent
                        visits until the cookie is cleared. <br>
                        <br>
                        You are given the ability to either accept or decline cookies. The majority of web browsers will
                        be set to automatically accept cookies, though this can be modified such that the browser
                        declines any cookies in the event that this is preferred. In the event that you choose to
                        decline any cookies, you may be unable to fully experience any of the interactive features that
                        of which the Company services or its web page offer. <br>
                        <br>
                        The FFC Plugin also uses "cookies". We do this for two reasons. First, we use the cookies to
                        store a code designating a marketing or distribution source for the FFC Plugin. This information
                        allows us to properly distinguish between FFC Plugin versions for purposes of analysing
                        retention and usage per marketing or distribution source, on an aggregated basis. Second, the
                        FFC Plugin uses cookies to store user preferences. For example, we use a cookie to record which
                        search engine you have selected as your default provider. Upon accessing the search results
                        pages, cookies may also be placed on your computer, to store your use preferences. We do not
                        use cookies to track your use of the Internet in any other way or to store any
                        personally-identifiable information, and we do not disclose cookie information to third parties
                        (other than as required by legal process). Certain third party partners/service providers may
                        also use cookies in relation to services they provide on or via the FFC Plugin. For example,
                        when you click on a third party offer presented via an Affinity FFC Plugin product, such third
                        party may place an affiliate cookie on your computer to facilitate your interaction with the
                        third party. Please note - third party sites, offers and/or cookies are not controlled by us.
                        Such content is subject to  policies of its respective third party owner (found on the third
