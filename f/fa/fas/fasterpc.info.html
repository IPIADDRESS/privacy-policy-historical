<p><b>"I do NOT share, sell, lend or lease <u>any</u> of the information that uniquely identifies you as a subscriber"</b></p>

<p>I have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate my firm and continuing commitment to the privacy
of personal information provided by those visiting and interacting with this web site. I hold the privacy of your
personal information in the highest regard. The following discloses my information gathering and dissemination
practices for this website.</p>

<p>I recognize the importance of protecting your privacy and my policy is designed to assist you in
understanding how I collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to me and to assist you in
making informed decisions when using my site. This policy will be continuously assessed against new technologies,
business practices and my subscribers and customers needs.</p>

<p>What Information Do I Collect?<br><br>
When you visit this web site you may provide me with two types of information: personal information you knowingly
choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web site use information collected on an aggregate
basis as you and others browse my Web site.</p>

<p>1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide</p>

<p>Registration Information<br><br>
When you register for any of our products, services or newsletters you will provide us information about
yourself.</p>

<p>Credit Card Information:<br><br>
If you choose to avail of our services, you may need to give personal information and authorization to obtain
information from various credit services. For example, you may need to provide the following information to our
resellers, Paypal.com or Clickbank.com and their merchant account. We do not store such data on our website, nor do we have access to
it:<br><br>
-Name<br>
-Mailing address<br>
-Email address<br>
-Credit card number, name and billing address<br>
-Business and home phone number</p>

<p>Email Information:<br><br>
If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with
your email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we
employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.</p>

<p>2. Web Site Use Information<br><br>
Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see
explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and web server log files to collect information about how our Web site is
used/visited. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages
viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site.</p>

<p>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing
the products and services you requested, to process your payment, to monitor the use of the service, our
marketing and promotional efforts and improve our content and service offerings and customize our site's content,
layout, services and for other lawful purposes. These uses improve our site and better tailor it to meet your
needs.</p>

<p>Furthermore, such information may be shared with others on an aggregate basis. Personally identifiable
information or business information will NOT be shared with parties except as required by law.</p>

<p>Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Website,
new services, and special offers we think you will find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish
to receive these offers by emailing us at the link provided in the email messages/newsletter.</p>

<p>What Are Cookies?<br><br>
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web
site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive
specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's
preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it
has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies.
However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse
cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not
function as effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie can NOT retrieve any other data from your hard drive or
pass on computer viruses.</p>

<p>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?<br><br>

As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases,
we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in
conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web
site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly improve our Web site
and better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not
intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to us in your cookies.</p>

<p>IP Addresses:<br><br>
IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number
that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our
web server as part of demographic and profile data known as “traffic data” so that data (such as the Web pages you
request) can be sent to you.</p>

<p><b>Sharing and Selling Information:</b><br><br>
<b>We do NOT share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely identify a subscriber</b> (such as email
addresses, names or any other personal details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process transactions or provide
services that you have requested.</p>

<p>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?<br><br>
You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our
database by emailing us at the usual address.</p>

<p>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?<br><br>
We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that
the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose account information when we
have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action
against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the Public.</p>

<p>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?<br><br>
We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site or the information or
content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics
that may be useful to the users of our Web site.</p>

<p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to another web site, our Privacy Policy is no
longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other web site, including web sites, which have a link on
our Website, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before
proceeding.</p>

<p>Your Consent<br><br>
By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this
Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or without notice.</p>

<p>Our Commitment To Data Security:</p>

<p>Please note that your information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United Kingdom. The laws
on holding personal data in the United Kingdom may be less stringent than the laws of your Country of residence or
citizenship. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we
have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
information we collect online.</p>

<p>Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out:<br><br>
This site allows visitors to unsubscribe so that they will not receive future messages, by simply clicking on the link at the end of EVERY email message. After unsubscribing we will discontinue sending the particular messages as soon as technically feasible (Aweber does this automatically after clicking the unsubscribe link).</p>

<p>A Special Note About Children:</p>

<p>Children are not eligible to use our services unsupervised and we ask that children (under the age of 16) do not
submit any personal information to us. If you are a minor, you can use this service only in conjunction with
permission and guidance from your parents or guardians.</p>

<p>Acquisition or Changes in Ownership:</p>

<p>In the event that the web site (or a substantial portion of its assets) is acquired, your information would be
considered part of those assets, and may be part of those assets that are transferred.</p>

<p>Privacy Policy Modifications:</p>

<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes are made to this privacy policy, we will
email users who have given us permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back
periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the
personal information you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent
with this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent.</p>

<p>Many Thanks,</p>

<p>Stewart J. Robinson
