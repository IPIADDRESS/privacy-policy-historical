<h4>
How is personal information collected?
</h4>
<br>
FasterLouder is Australiaï¿½s leading online community of rock music fans. In order to provide customers with a quality service, FasterLouder.com.au offers customers the ability to sign up as a community member, interact with other members, subscribe to our newsletter, enter competitions and purchase tickets online through http://www.FasterLouder.com.au. In order to provide these services, FasterLouder.com.au collects personal information about customers. Collection of this information will occur at the time you enter a competition, make a purchase or when you register as a FasterLouder.com.au member through our website.
<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<h4>What personal information does FasterLouder.com.au collect and why?</h4>
<br>
If you purchase tickets, register as a member or enter a competition through FasterLouder.com.au, we need to collect personal information about you, including your name, address, email address and telephone number(s). The reason we need this information is so we can contact you to send you a prize, or to notify you in the case of an event cancellation or change of event details. We also need some of this information in order to process your online credit card payment. FasterLouder.com.au will also provide you with the opportunity to receive special offers and promotions if you wish to do so. Even if you initially choose to subscribe to receive special offers, you may also unsubscribe or resubscribe at a later stage - all you need to do is visit <a href="http://www.FasterLouder.com.au/p/newsletter/" class="blue">http://www.FasterLouder.com.au/p/newsletter/</a> (or contact FasterLouder.com.au through the contact details at 12 below).
<br><br></li>
<li>
<h4>Will personal information be given to anyone else?</h4>
<br>
FasterLouder.com.au will not sell or trade personal information about you to or with third parties. FasterLouder.com.au will only disclose information about you, if you have given your consent, so that you can be provided with promotional material and special offers. Otherwise, FasterLouder.com.au will only disclose personal information if this is required by law or permitted under the Privacy Act.
<br><br>
</li><li>
<h4>Security of personal information</h4>
<br>
FasterLouder.com.au protects the personal information it collects in a secure database, which can only be accessed by employees with the highest security clearance. FasterLouder.com.au employees are required, as a condition of their employment, to treat personal information held by FasterLouder.com.au as confidential, and to maintain the confidentiality of that personal information.<br><br></li>
<li>
<h4>Non-customer information
</h4><br>
Sometimes, FasterLouder.com.au needs to collect personal information about individuals who are not customers. This will usually arise where we collect the name and business contact details of our clients. FasterLouder.com.au's policy is to only use personal information collected from non-customers for the main business purpose for which it was collected.
<br><br></li><li>
<h4>Access and correction</h4>
<br>
Under the Privacy Act, you have a right to seek access to information that FasterLouder.com.au holds about you. You also have the right to ask us to correct information about you, which is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date. As an FasterLouder member, you are able to access or correct the personal information that FasterLouder.com.au holds about you - simply by logging onto our website at <a href="http://www.FasterLouder.com.au/p/auth/editprofile.php" class="blue">http://www.FasterLouder.com.au/p/auth/editprofile.php</a>. Both members and non-members may ask us to correct information, which is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date. To provide you with access to personal information about you, FasterLouder.com.au would usually provide you with a print-out of the relevant personal information from our database. If you wish to access the personal information that we hold about you, please set out your request in writing, including your phone number, and forward this to our Privacy Officer at PO Box 1964, Strawberry Hills NSW 2012. In the interests of protecting the privacy of individuals about whom we hold personal information, we will require that you verify your identity by enclosing a copy of a form of identification such as a current driver's licence or passport with your written request (this will be returned to you after your identity has been verified). If you wish to change personal information that is inaccurate or out-of-date, please contact our Privacy Officer, using the contact details at 12 below, with your request for correction. FasterLouder.com.au's policy is to consider any requests for access or correction within 21 days. Ordinarily, FasterLouder.com.au will not charge you for the cost of providing this type of access to these records. However, if we do propose to charge you, we will advise you of the relevant charge before we provide you with access.
<br><br></li>

<ol>

not use the Community Services to threaten, harass, stalk, or abuse 
others participating in any Community Service. Refrain from all expressions

the wrong forum and your thread is moved or deleted.</li>
<li> Have a point. Threads with no point will be removed at the moderators' 
discretion. </li>
<li> Use the forums appropriately. Do not use the forums if your messages 
would be more appropriate in a private message, email, chat, or phone 
conversation. </li>

people with slow connections. If the images are very large consider 
using a URL instead. Images may be removed at the moderators' discretion.

or ban users, as well as edit or remove posts that violate this Code 
of Conduct. </li>
<li>If you publish material which defames another person, or which amounts 
to unlawful discrimination or the incitement of hatred, then you may 
be held liable for those actions. Although your privacy is protected 
by FasterLouder.com.au's <a href="/policy">privacy policy</a>, you should be aware 
that FasterLouder.com.au may be required, by law or court order, to 
disclose certain information which it holds. You may not be as anonymous 
as you think you are ï¿½ which is another good reason to follow these 
guidelines. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Section 2: Stay Within The Law</h4>
<ol>
<li> FasterLouder.com.au does not allow any illegal activities. You cannot 
use the Community Services to publish, post, distribute, or disseminate 
defamatory, infringing, obscene, or other unlawful material or information. 
</li>
<li>Do not post somebody else's private details. These include but are 
not limited to the following: real name, workplace, phone number, home 
address, car registration or e-mail address. Doing so will result in 
an immediate ban. </li>

possession, procurement and consumption of drugs, criminal activity 
and other associated issues. </li>
<li>Do not upload files or post messages that contain photos, software

</ol>
<h4>Section 3: Be Excellent To Each Other</h4>
<ol>
<li> FasterLouder.com.au does not tolerate disruptive activity online, 
such as persistent off-topic comments and postings or statements that 
incite others to violate this Code of Conduct or participate in illegal 
activities. The community is a vibrant and positive place. We'd like 
to keep it that way. </li>
<li>FasterLouder.com.au does not allow posting or use of computer programs 
that contain destructive features such as: viruses, worms, Trojan horses, 
or bots for the use of scrolling, showing multiple screens, and other 
activities that can be disruptive to online communication. </li>
<li>Community Services may NOT be used to promote views about subliminal 
messages contained within any other artists' music. </li>
<li>Falsely impersonating a FasterLouder.com.au employee, agent, moderator, 
host, volunteer, forum user, or any other person with the intent to 
mislead or cause harm to others is forbidden. A user account that is 
likely to mislead others will be banned. </li>
<li>FasterLouder.com.au reserves the right to ban a user at any time, 
without notice, from any or all Community Services for offences relating 
to disruption of others or for violation of this Code. </li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li> FasterLouder.com.au is privileged to have many good relationships

is welcome where appropriate, but disruptive or abusive comments will 
not be tolerated.</li>
<li> Promoters are welcome to answer questions about events on the forums. 
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Section 5: No Spam - No Selling</h4>
<ol>
<li>Please don't "spam" through the Community Services. To spam 
includes sending identical and irrelevant submissions to many different 
forums, posting one word replies, or posting gimmick replies. These 
are frequently an attempt to increase your post count. Usually such 
postings have nothing to do with the particular topic of the group or 
are of no real interest to those reading the thread. To spam also includes 
misrepresenting the source of anything you say or post. Spamming is 
a serious violation of online etiquette. </li>
<li> The forums are not to be used as advertisements for your events.
If you want to let people know about your event then use the Gig Guide
section of FasterLouder.com.au and submit your event there. Remember
that by advertising on the forums you are unfairly taking away from
promoters who have purchased banner advertisements on FasterLouder.com.au.
Moderators will remove advertising threads.        </li>
<li> FasterLouder.com.au reserves the right to ban a user at any time, 
without notice, from any or all Community Services for spamming. </li>
<li>The Community Services areas may be used to provide supplemental information 
regarding your own business (provided you do not use spam to provide 
this information); however, the Community Services areas are not designed 
to be used as a mechanism for operating your business or providing core 
information about your business. Any use of the Community Services for 
commercial purposes is solely at your own risk and FasterLouder.com.au 
has no liability for such use. </li>
<li>Any space provided to you in any Community Service is for your own 
personal use. You may not sell, license, exchange or barter any space 
provided to you within any Community Service for any purpose including, 
without limitation, selling, licensing, exchanging or bartering space 
for advertisements. This means you may not promote your club night in 
the forum. If you'd like assistance in promoting your event, please 
email sales@fasterlouder.com.au </li>
</ol>  
<h4>Section 6: You Are Responsible</h4>
<ol>
<li> You are responsible and liable for all your activities while participating 
in the Community Services. Remember, you are responsible for anything 
you say or post. You are responsible for your FasterLouder.com.au forum 
account. Your account may not to be shared with another person. Please 
take care to log out of your fasterlouder.com.au account if you are 
accessing FasterLouder.com.au from a computer in a public place. Each 
user will be held ultimately accountable for all posts made from their 
account. </li>
<li>FasterLouder.com.au offers our users the ability to create their own 
Community Services areas (e.g. chats, communities and personal web pages). 
FasterLouder.com.au takes no responsibility for the ratings, content, 
nor any activities resulting from the content or otherwise, in these 
areas. The creators or hosts of these user-created areas are required 
to agree to and uphold this Code of Conduct before creating their Community 
Service. </li>

<li>Some Community Services may post Internet website links in their area. 
Please be advised that fasterlouder.com.au is not responsible for the 
content on the websites associated with the links you may view.</li>
<li>Posting offensive content (including but not limited to text, images 
or links to objectionable content) is expressly prohibited. Offensive 
content is defined as adult content, gross depictions of disease or 
injury, or any other content that a reasonable person would find objectionable. 
Remember that many users visit these forums from their workplace, and 
that you may be risking a person's job by posting such content. </li>
<li>You are responsible for any actions you may take based on advice or 
information you receive online. Use your own good judgment when evaluating 
information provided through any Community Service, remember that the 
information provided could be from people at any age and experience

Conduct. </li>
<li> FasterLouder.com.au reserves the right to immediately terminate

the forums more enjoyable for the FasterLouder.com.au community as a 
whole. </li>
<li> If you feel that somebody has breached the community guidelines we 
strongly suggest you use the ï¿½Report this post to a moderatorï¿½ function. 
This function sends an email to every moderator of that forum, and alerts 
us to a breach of this Code of Conduct. Do not create a new thread or 
reply to the post as you will simply bump the thread to the top of the 
screen for everyone else to see. </li>
<li>If a thread is deleted or closed, or a post is removed, and you want 
to know why this has happened, do not start a new thread questioning 
the whereabouts of the post/thread. Such threads will be deleted. Simply 
send an email or private message to the moderators of that forum. </li>
<li>If you feel a moderator has been unfair in handling an issue, then 
send an email or private message to our Managing Editor. </li>
<li>Moderators use a combination of common-sense and these guidelines 
when making decisions. If you breach these guidelines, expect to lose 
your forum privileges either temporarily or permanently. These guidelines 
are in place to make fasterlouder.com.au a pleasant place to be. If 
you do not want to abide by the rules you are NOT welcome on the website.
