		<h1>
			Privacy Policy
		</h1>
		<p>
			Farmigo, Inc., and its' affiliates (collectively referred to here as
			"Farmigo") provide this privacy policy ("Policy") to explain how we
			collect, use and protect (or, in some cases, do not protect), your
			personal information as you interact with us online through the
			"farmigo.com" web site. Farmigo recognizes the importance of
			protecting personally identifiable information provided by users of
			the site, as well as for persons included in our subscriber mailing
			lists. The following privacy policy grows from our fundamental
			respect for our users' right to privacy and will serve to guide our
			relationships with our users and subscribers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Farmigo reserves the right to change this Policy at any time by
			posting a new privacy statement on our web site. You are responsible
			for checking periodically for changes. By accessing the site, you
			indicate your agreement to and acceptance of the terms of this
			Policy, and consent to the collection, retention and use of your
			personally identifiable information consistent with this Policy, as
			amended from time to time. If you are visiting our site from outside
			the United States, there may be special rules or limitations on your
			use of this web site.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Information Collected by Farmigo
		</h2>
		<p>
			Farmigo and its authorized service providers collect information
			about users during their registration for our various subscription
			lists, their participation in certain activities on our web site,
			their purchase of products or services through the site, and through
			the use of cookies. When users request pages from our server, our
			web server automatically collects some information about the users,
			including their IP addresses. These IP addresses are used by
			computers to send the requested pages to users.
		</p>
		<p>
			If a user wishes to subscribe to our mailing list and/or newsletter,
			we collect and retain contact information such as name, email and
			mailing address. We may also collect and retain information
			regarding the types of information or topics that are of interest if
			we are provided with that information, as well as identification of
			which communications our users wish to receive.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Use of Information
		</h2>
		<p>
			Except as disclosed to you or as otherwise described in this Policy,
			as may be amended from time to time, Farmigo will not share any
			personally identifiable information that subscribers or web site
			users provide to us with any third party for their direct marketing
			purposes. Farmigo will disclose info to the extent necessary to
			comply with applicable laws or legal processes (e.g., subpoenas). We
			will cooperate with law enforcement authorities. Farmigo may use
			information that it collects to provide, maintain, protect and
			improve our services, as well as to protect the rights and property
			of Farmigo and of our users and suppliers. Farmigo may share your
			personal information where it is necessary for us to complete a
			transaction or do something that you have asked us to do.
		</p>
		<p>
			Farmigo uses visitors' IP addresses to help diagnose problems with
			our server and to administer our Web site. We also use them to
			gather broad demographic information about our users in general.
			This information does not contain anything that can identify users
			personally. We may combine demographic information supplied by a
			subscriber at registration with site usage data to provide profiles,
			in aggregate form, about our users and their preferences in the
			content of the site and advertising.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any information disclosed in public areas of the site will become
			public information. Farmigo cannot control the use of information
			disclosed in public forums, such as forums, blogs, bulletin boards,
			groups, or chat rooms. Farmigo will treat any postings by users,
			feedback, emails or suggestions to us as NON-CONFIDENTIAL and as
			NON-PROPRIETARY. If you choose to use your real name, it will be
			available to and viewable by anyone.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Registering With Merchants and Service Providers
		</h2>
		<p>
			If you choose to be in contact with a merchant or service provider
			through farmigo.com you will need to register with the merchant or
			service provider. Where such registration (and other contacts with
			the merchant or service provider) is made through farmigo.com, the
			information you provide will be provided to the relevant merchant or
			service provider. Farmigo will handle your information in accordance
			with this policy. The merchant or service provider will handle your
			information in accordance with its own privacy policy. It is your
			responsibility to check the privacy policy of the merchant or
			service provider. Farmigo will not have any liability, obligation,
			or responsibility in connection with the actions of merchants and
			service providers, including with respect to their handling of your
			information.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Using e-mail and mailing addresses
		</h2>
		<p>
			Farmigo may send out e-mail and mail to our subscribers about
			services and products offered by Farmigo and our partners. Farmigo
			may work with service providers to assist with these mailings, and
			these service providers may have access to your personally
			identifiable information. Third parties will not contact our
			subscribers through the use of our e-mail and mailing lists except
			through our own emails or newsletters that may contain messages from
			our partners within the email and/or mail themselves, or unless
			users ask to be placed on a list to receive e-mail and/or mail from
			our partners on subjects of interest.
		</p>
		<h2>
			If You Are Under the Age of 18
		</h2>
		<p>
			If you are under 18, you may use farmigo.com only with involvement
			of a parent or guardian. Farmigo does not knowingly collect or
			solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or
			knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, you
			should not attempt to register for this site or send information
			about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone
			number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any
			personal information to or on the site. If a child under 13 submits
			information through any part of the site without verification of
			parental consent, and we learn the person submitting the information
			is a child or such consent has not been verified, we will attempt to
			delete this information as soon as possible. Because we do not
			knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13,
			we do not use or disclose such information to third parties.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Your California Privacy Rights
		</h2>
		<p>
			California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits residents of
			California who are registered users and use our service for private,
			family or household purposes to request certain standard information
			regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties
			for their direct marketing purposes (including a list of categories
			of data disclosed in the previous calendar year and names and
			addresses of data recipients). To make such a request, please
			contact us as provided below.
		</p>
		<h2>
			International Visitors
		</h2>
		<p>
			Because Farmigo operates in many countries, circumstances could
			arise where it is necessary for us to make your personal information
			available to our worldwide business units. Privacy laws differ
			across the globe. If we share your information with a Farmigo
			affiliate or business unit that is outside of the United States, we
			will do so consistent with this Policy.
		</p>
		<p>
			This site is hosted in the United States and is intended for United
			States visitors. If you are visiting from the European Union or
			other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may
			differ from United States law, please note that you are transferring
			your personal data to the United States and by providing your
			personal data you consent to that transfer. When you provide
			personal data to Farmigo or our service providers or vendors, you
			consent to the processing of your data in the United States as the
			site is operated in the United States.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Additional Terms
		</h2>
		<p>
			To request that we remove your personally identifiable information
			from our database or to "opt-out" of any further e-mail or contact,
			send request to info[at]farmigo[dot]com . Farmigo will make a good
			faith effort to comply with such written requests within thirty days
			of receipt of the request.
		</p>
		<p>
			Farmigo uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information
			disclosed to us secure and to disclose such information only to
			responsible third parties. Please note that Farmigo makes no
			guarantee that information provided to us will not be accessed,
			disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of firewalls or secure
			server software. Farmigo is not responsible for circumvention of any
			privacy settings or security measures contained on the site. If
			there is a breach of security that impacts your personally
			identifiable information, you agree that Farmigo may notify you of
			the breach by electronic mail using any email address that you have
			provided to us for you.
		</p>
		<p>
			If Farmigo should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another
			company, or if we should decide to buy, sell or reorganize some part
			or all of our business, Farmigo may disclose your personally
			identifiable information to prospective or actual purchasers or
			receive such information from sellers. Farmigo intends to seek
			appropriate protection for information disclosed or received in
			these types of transactions

		<h2>
			Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement
		</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that
				any content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a
				notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
				("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following
				information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):
				<ul>
					<li>
						A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act
						on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
						infringed
					</li>
					<li>
						Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been
						infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online
						site are covered by a single notification, a representative list
						of such works at that site
					</li>
					<li>
						Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing
						or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be
						removed or access to which is to be disabled and information
						reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate
						the material
					</li>
					<li>
						Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider
						to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if
						available, an electronic mail
					</li>
					<li>
						A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the
						material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the
						copyright owner, its agent, or the law and
					</li>
					<li>
						A statement that the information in the notification is accurate,
						and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on
						behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
						infringed.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Farmigo's designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of
				claimed infringement is: Yossi Pik, 1 Bavli, Tel-Aviv, Israel,
				62331, Yossi [at] Farmigo [dot] com. For clarity, only DMCA notices
				should go to the Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments,
				requests for technical support, and other communications should be
				directed to Farmigo customer service through info [at] Farmigo
				[dot] com. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of
				the requirements of this Statement, your DMCA notice may not be
				valid.
			</li>
			<li>
				Counter-Notice. If you believe that your content that was removed
				by Farmigo (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or
				that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the
				copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use
				the content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following
				information to the Copyright Agent:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Your physical or electronic signature
					</li>
					<li>
						Identification of the content that has been removed or to which
						access has been disabled and the location at which the content
						appeared before it was removed or disabled
					</li>
					<li>
						A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content
						was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a
						misidentification of the content and
					</li>
					<li>
						Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a
						statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal
						court in Delaware, and a statement that you will accept service
						of process from the person who provided notification of the
						alleged infringement.
					</li>
					<li>
						If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Farmigo
						may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining
						party informing that person that it may replace the removed
						content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the
						copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the
						content provider, member or user, the removed content may be
						replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or
						more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Farmigo's sole
						discretion.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				If we become aware that one of our users is a repeat copyright
				infringer, it is our policy to take reasonable steps within our
				power to terminate that user.
			</li>
			<li>
				It is our policy to accommodate and not interfere with standard
				technical measures used by copyright owners to identify or protect
				copyrighted works that we determine are reasonable under the
				circumstances.
			</li>
