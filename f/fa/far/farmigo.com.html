		<h2>
			Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement
		</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that
				any content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a
				notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
				("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following
				information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):
				<ul>
					<li>
						A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act
						on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
						infringed
					</li>
					<li>
						Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been
						infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online
						site are covered by a single notification, a representative list
						of such works at that site
					</li>
					<li>
						Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing
						or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be
						removed or access to which is to be disabled and information
						reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate
						the material
					</li>
					<li>
						Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider
						to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if
						available, an electronic mail
					</li>
					<li>
						A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the
						material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the
						copyright owner, its agent, or the law and
					</li>
					<li>
						A statement that the information in the notification is accurate,
						and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on
						behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
						infringed.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Farmigo's designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of
				claimed infringement is: Yossi Pik, 1 Bavli, Tel-Aviv, Israel,
				62331, Yossi [at] Farmigo [dot] com. For clarity, only DMCA notices
				should go to the Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments,
				requests for technical support, and other communications should be
				directed to Farmigo customer service through info [at] Farmigo
				[dot] com. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of
				the requirements of this Statement, your DMCA notice may not be
				valid.
			</li>
			<li>
				Counter-Notice. If you believe that your content that was removed
				by Farmigo (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or
				that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the
				copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use
				the content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following
				information to the Copyright Agent:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Your physical or electronic signature
					</li>
					<li>
						Identification of the content that has been removed or to which
						access has been disabled and the location at which the content
						appeared before it was removed or disabled
					</li>
					<li>
						A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content
						was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a
						misidentification of the content and
					</li>
					<li>
						Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a
						statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal
						court in Delaware, and a statement that you will accept service
						of process from the person who provided notification of the
						alleged infringement.
					</li>
					<li>
						If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Farmigo
						may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining
						party informing that person that it may replace the removed
						content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the
						copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the
						content provider, member or user, the removed content may be
						replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or
						more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Farmigo's sole
						discretion.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				If we become aware that one of our users is a repeat copyright
				infringer, it is our policy to take reasonable steps within our
				power to terminate that user.
			</li>
			<li>
				It is our policy to accommodate and not interfere with standard
				technical measures used by copyright owners to identify or protect
				copyrighted works that we determine are reasonable under the
				circumstances.
			</li>
