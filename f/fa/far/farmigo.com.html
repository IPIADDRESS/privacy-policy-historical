			<h1>
				Privacy Policy
			</h1>
			<p>
				Farmigo, Inc., and its' affiliates (collectively referred to here as
				"Farmigo") provide this privacy policy ("Policy") to explain how we
				collect, use and protect (or, in some cases, do not protect), your
				personal information as you interact with us online through the
				"farmigo.com" web site. Farmigo recognizes the importance of
				protecting personally identifiable information provided by users of
				the site, as well as for persons included in our subscriber mailing
				lists. The following privacy policy grows from our fundamental
				respect for our users' right to privacy and will serve to guide our
				relationships with our users and subscribers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Farmigo reserves the right to change this Policy at any time by
				posting a new privacy statement on our web site. You are responsible
				for checking periodically for changes. By accessing the site, you
				indicate your agreement to and acceptance of the terms of this
				Policy, and consent to the collection, retention and use of your
				personally identifiable information consistent with this Policy, as
				amended from time to time. If you are visiting our site from outside
				the United States, there may be special rules or limitations on your
				use of this web site.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Information Collected by Farmigo
			</h2>
			<p>
				Farmigo and its authorized service providers collect information
				about users during their registration for our various subscription
				lists, their participation in certain activities on our web site,
				their purchase of products or services through the site, and through
				the use of cookies. When users request pages from our server, our
				web server automatically collects some information about the users,
				including their IP addresses. These IP addresses are used by
				computers to send the requested pages to users.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a user wishes to subscribe to our mailing list and/or newsletter,
				we collect and retain contact information such as name, email and
				mailing address. We may also collect and retain information
				regarding the types of information or topics that are of interest if
				we are provided with that information, as well as identification of
				which communications our users wish to receive.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Use of Information
			</h2>
			<p>
				Except as disclosed to you or as otherwise described in this Policy,
				as may be amended from time to time, Farmigo will not share any
				personally identifiable information that subscribers or web site
				users provide to us with any third party for their direct marketing
				purposes. Farmigo will disclose info to the extent necessary to
				comply with applicable laws or legal processes (e.g., subpoenas). We
				will cooperate with law enforcement authorities. Farmigo may use
				information that it collects to provide, maintain, protect and
				improve our services, as well as to protect the rights and property
				of Farmigo and of our users and suppliers. Farmigo may share your
				personal information where it is necessary for us to complete a
				transaction or do something that you have asked us to do.
			</p>
			<p>
				Farmigo uses visitors' IP addresses to help diagnose problems with
				our server and to administer our Web site. We also use them to
				gather broad demographic information about our users in general.
				This information does not contain anything that can identify users
				personally. We may combine demographic information supplied by a
				subscriber at registration with site usage data to provide profiles,
				in aggregate form, about our users and their preferences in the
				content of the site and advertising.
			</p>
			<p>
				Any information disclosed in public areas of the site will become
				public information. Farmigo cannot control the use of information
				disclosed in public forums, such as forums, blogs, bulletin boards,
				groups, or chat rooms. Farmigo will treat any postings by users,
				feedback, emails or suggestions to us as NON-CONFIDENTIAL and as
				NON-PROPRIETARY. If you choose to use your real name, it will be
				available to and viewable by anyone.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Registering With Merchants and Service Providers
			</h2>
			<p>
				If you choose to be in contact with a merchant or service provider
				through farmigo.com you will need to register with the merchant or
				service provider. Where such registration (and other contacts with
				the merchant or service provider) is made through farmigo.com, the
				information you provide will be provided to the relevant merchant or
				service provider. Farmigo will handle your information in accordance
				with this policy. The merchant or service provider will handle your
				information in accordance with its own privacy policy. It is your
				responsibility to check the privacy policy of the merchant or
				service provider. Farmigo will not have any liability, obligation,
				or responsibility in connection with the actions of merchants and
				service providers, including with respect to their handling of your
				information.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Using e-mail and mailing addresses
			</h2>
			<p>
				Farmigo may send out e-mail and mail to our subscribers about
				services and products offered by Farmigo and our partners. Farmigo
				may work with service providers to assist with these mailings, and
				these service providers may have access to your personally
				identifiable information. Third parties will not contact our
				subscribers through the use of our e-mail and mailing lists except
				through our own emails or newsletters that may contain messages from
				our partners within the email and/or mail themselves, or unless
				users ask to be placed on a list to receive e-mail and/or mail from
				our partners on subjects of interest.
			</p>
			<h2>

			</h2>
			<p>

				of a parent or guardian. Farmigo does not knowingly collect or
				solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or
				knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, you
				should not attempt to register for this site or send information
				about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone
				number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any
				personal information to or on the site. If a child under 13 submits
				information through any part of the site without verification of
				parental consent, and we learn the person submitting the information
				is a child or such consent has not been verified, we will attempt to
				delete this information as soon as possible. Because we do not
				knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13,
				we do not use or disclose such information to third parties.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Your California Privacy Rights
			</h2>
			<p>
				California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits residents of
				California who are registered users and use our service for private,
				family or household purposes to request certain standard information
				regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties
				for their direct marketing purposes (including a list of categories
				of data disclosed in the previous calendar year and names and
				addresses of data recipients). To make such a request, please
				contact us as provided below.
			</p>
			<h2>
				International Visitors
			</h2>
			<p>
				Because Farmigo operates in many countries, circumstances could
				arise where it is necessary for us to make your personal information
				available to our worldwide business units. Privacy laws differ
				across the globe. If we share your information with a Farmigo
				affiliate or business unit that is outside of the United States, we
				will do so consistent with this Policy.
			</p>
			<p>
				This site is hosted in the United States and is intended for United
				States visitors. If you are visiting from the European Union or
				other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may
				differ from United States law, please note that you are transferring
				your personal data to the United States and by providing your
				personal data you consent to that transfer. When you provide
				personal data to Farmigo or our service providers or vendors, you
				consent to the processing of your data in the United States as the
				site is operated in the United States.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Additional Terms
			</h2>
			<p>
				To request that we remove your personally identifiable information
				from our database or to "opt-out" of any further e-mail or contact,
				send request to info[at]farmigo[dot]com . Farmigo will make a good
				faith effort to comply with such written requests within thirty days
				of receipt of the request.
			</p>
			<p>
				Farmigo uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information
				disclosed to us secure and to disclose such information only to
				responsible third parties. Please note that Farmigo makes no
				guarantee that information provided to us will not be accessed,
				disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of firewalls or secure
				server software. Farmigo is not responsible for circumvention of any
				privacy settings or security measures contained on the site. If
				there is a breach of security that impacts your personally
				identifiable information, you agree that Farmigo may notify you of
				the breach by electronic mail using any email address that you have
				provided to us for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				If Farmigo should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another
				company, or if we should decide to buy, sell or reorganize some part
				or all of our business, Farmigo may disclose your personally
				identifiable information to prospective or actual purchasers or
				receive such information from sellers. Farmigo intends to seek
				appropriate protection for information disclosed or received in
				these types of transactions

				Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement
			</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that
					any content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a
					notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
					("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following
					information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):
					<ul>
						<li>
							A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act
							on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
							infringed
						</li>
						<li>
							Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been
							infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online
							site are covered by a single notification, a representative list
							of such works at that site
						</li>
						<li>
							Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing
							or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be
							removed or access to which is to be disabled and information
							reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate
							the material
						</li>
						<li>
							Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider
							to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if
							available, an electronic mail
						</li>
						<li>
							A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the
							material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the
							copyright owner, its agent, or the law and
						</li>
						<li>
							A statement that the information in the notification is accurate,
							and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on
							behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
							infringed.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Farmigo's designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of
					claimed infringement is: Yossi Pik, 1 Bavli, Tel-Aviv, Israel,
					62331, Yossi [at] Farmigo [dot] com. For clarity, only DMCA notices
					should go to the Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments,
					requests for technical support, and other communications should be
					directed to Farmigo customer service through info [at] Farmigo
					[dot] com. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of
					the requirements of this Statement, your DMCA notice may not be
					valid.
				</li>
				<li>
					Counter-Notice. If you believe that your content that was removed
					by Farmigo (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or
					that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the
					copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use
					the content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following
					information to the Copyright Agent:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Your physical or electronic signature
						</li>
						<li>
							Identification of the content that has been removed or to which
							access has been disabled and the location at which the content
							appeared before it was removed or disabled
						</li>
						<li>
							A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content
							was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a
							misidentification of the content and
						</li>
						<li>
							Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a
							statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal
							court in Delaware, and a statement that you will accept service
							of process from the person who provided notification of the
							alleged infringement.
						</li>
						<li>
							If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Farmigo
							may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining
							party informing that person that it may replace the removed
							content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the
							copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the
							content provider, member or user, the removed content may be
							replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or
							more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Farmigo's sole
							discretion.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					If we become aware that one of our users is a repeat copyright
					infringer, it is our policy to take reasonable steps within our
					power to terminate that user.
				</li>
				<li>
					It is our policy to accommodate and not interfere with standard
					technical measures used by copyright owners to identify or protect
					copyrighted works that we determine are reasonable under the
					circumstances.
				</li>
