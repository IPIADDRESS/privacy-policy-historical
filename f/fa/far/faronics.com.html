      <p>Faronics respects the privacy of our online visitors and recognizes
        the importance of providing a secure environment for them; we have made
        every effort to provide this.</p>
      <p>Faronics may require you to provide us with personal information if
        you would like to participate in some activities on, or benefit from
        services offered on, our website. We have made every attempt to limit
        our personal information requirements to only that information which
        we believe is necessary to fulfill a visitor’s request.</p>
      <p>Personal information collected on this website is often limited to e-mail
        addresses and job titles, but we may ask for additional information when
        needed to provide a requested service. For example, if you choose a service
        or transaction that requires payment, such as making a purchase on Faronics’ online
        store, we will request personal information necessary for billing and/or
        shipping such as name, address, telephone number and credit card number.
        Faronics does not collect personal information from site visitors unless
        it is intentionally provided.</p>
      <p>Any information provided by visitors to our website will be used for
        internal purposes only. Personal user data entered on the Faronics site
        will not be sold, released, or made available to any third party outside
        of Faronics. This information is collected with the sole purpose of meeting
        the needs of our customers, to answer questions from visitors, and to
        provide information and services to these visitors.</p>
      <p>Please note that when you link to other sites from the Faronics.com
        site, this Privacy Policy does not apply to those other sites. </p>
