            <div id="text"><h2>Privacy Policy</h2><p></p>Last updated February 6, 2009<p></p>FareSpotter LLC (the “Company”) has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy.

This data may include referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords, JavaScript enablement and individual user click behavior. However, no personally identifiable information is used in connection with this analysis of visitor activity. <p></p><h3>Cookies</h3><p></p>A cookie is a small piece of data that a web server places on a user's computer. The Company employs the use of cookies to ensure, for example, that you do not see repetitions of the same ad, to estimate and report audience size and traffic, and to customize and personalize your experience at the Site. Any reporting of audience size and traffic is not linked to personally identifiable information.<p></p>Some Company advertisers use pixels to track the effectiveness of the promotions they run on the Site. Such pixels may lead to cookies being placed on your computer by these advertisers. The Company does not have control over these 3rd party cookies, and cannot access any personally identifiable information about you as a result of these cookies.<p></p>Furthermore, the Site may, from time to time, use outside media companies to display advertisements on our site.
