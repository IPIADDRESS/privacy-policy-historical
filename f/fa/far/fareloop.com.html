The Company does not have control over these 3rd party cookies, and cannot access any personally identifiable information about you as a result of these cookies.<p></p>Furthermore, the Site may, from time to time, use outside media companies to display advertisements on our site. These ads may contain cookies, which are collected and tracked by the outside media company. The Company has no access to or control over these cookies.<p></p>Most web browsers provide users the ability to limit the use of cookies by allowing users to adjust privacy settings. If a user has their cookies disabled, the Site will still be accessible, however some sections of the web site may not perform as well as they normally would with cookies enabled.<p></p><h3>Emails and Unsubscribe Policy</h3><p></p>If you signed up for the Company's email newsletter, you were required to submit to us your email address and home airport.
