        <div><img src="img/content_line.jpg" alt=""></div>
                 
             
<p>If you are a customer of Farmers, you have already received this  notice. If you are not a customer, this notice provides you with information  about Farmers' privacy practices. Please note that the sections "Your  choice" and "Recipient of this Notice" below do not apply to  users who are not Farmers customers. If you become a customer, you  will receive a copy of this notice and the opportunity to advise us of your choice  regarding Farmers' use of certain information. </p>
<p>In the course of our business relationship  with you, we collect information about you that is necessary to provide you  with our products and services. We treat this information as confidential and  recognize the importance of protecting it. We value your confidence in us.</p>
<p>You trust us with an important part of your  financial life. We are proud of our privacy policies and procedures and  encourage you to review them carefully. </p>
<p>This notice from the member companies of the  Farmers Insurance Group of Companies<sup>Â®</sup> listed below ("Farmers'")  describes our privacy practices regarding information about our customers and  former customers that obtain financial products or services from us for  personal, family, or household purposes. When state law is more protective of  individuals than federal privacy law, we will protect information in accordance  with state law consistent with the requirements of federal preemption.</p>
<p><b>Information We Collect</b>
</p><p>We collect and maintain information about you to provide you with  the coverage, product or service you request and to service your account. 
</p><p>We collect certain information  ("nonpublic personal information") about you and the members of your  household ("you") from the following sources: </p>
<ul>
<li>Information we receive from you on applications or other forms, such as your social security number, assets, income, and property information; </li>
<li>Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others, such as your policy coverage, premiums, and payment history;  </li>
<li>Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency or insurance support organization, such as motor vehicle records, credit report information and claims history; and  </li>
<li>If you obtain a life, long-term care or disability product, information we receive from you, medical professionals who have provided care to you and insurance support organizations, regarding your health.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How We Protect Your Information</b>
</p><p>At Farmers, our customers are our most valued assets. Protecting  your privacy is important to us. We restrict access to personal information  about you to those individuals, such as our employees and agents, who provide  you with our products and services. We require those individuals to whom we  permit access to your customer information to protect it and keep it  confidential. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that  comply with applicable regulatory standards to guard your nonpublic personal  information. 
</p><p>We do not disclose any nonpublic personal  information about you, as our customer or former customer, except as described  in this notice. </p>
<p><b>Information We Disclose</b>
</p><p>We may disclose the nonpublic personal information we collect  about you, as described above, to companies that perform marketing services on  our behalf or to other financial institutions with which we have joint  marketing agreements and to other third parties, all as permitted by law. 
</p><p>Many employers, benefit plans or plan  sponsors restrict the information that can be shared about their employees or  members by companies that provide them with products or services. If you have a  relationship with Farmers or one of its affiliates as a result of products or  services provided through an employer, benefit plan or plan sponsor, we will  abide by the privacy restrictions imposed by that organization. </p>
<p>We are permitted to disclose personal  health information (1) to process your transaction with us, for instance, to  determine eligibility for coverage, to process claims or to prevent fraud; (2)  with your written authorization, and (3) otherwise as permitted by law. </p>
<p><b>Sharing Information with Affiliates</b>
</p><p>The Farmers family encompasses various affiliates that offer a  variety of financial products and services in addition to insurance. Sharing  information enables our affiliates to offer you a more complete range of  products and services.</p>
<p>We may disclose nonpublic personal  information, as described above in Information We Collect, to our affiliates,  which include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Financial service providers such as insurance companies and reciprocals, investment companies, underwriters and brokers/dealers; and </li>
<li>Non-financial service providers, such as management companies, attorneys-in-fact and billing companies.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are permitted by law to share with our affiliates our transaction and experience information with you.
</p><p>In addition, we may share with our affiliates consumer report  information, such as information from credit reports and certain application  information that we have received from you and from third parties, such as consumer  reporting agencies and insurance support organizations. 
</p><p><b>Your Choice</b>
</p><p>If it is your decision not to opt out and to allow sharing of  your information with our affiliates, you do not need to request an Opt-Out  Form or respond to us in any way. 
</p><p>If you have previously submitted a request  to opt-out on each of your policies, no further action is required. </p>
<p>You may opt out only by completing the Opt  Out Form. You may request additional copies by sending us a request at the  address shown on the form. An additional Opt Out Form will be mailed to you  shortly after receipt of your request. </p>
<p>If you prefer that we not share consumer  report information with our affiliates, except as otherwise permitted by law,  you may request an Opt-Out Form by calling toll free, 1-888-327-6335 (please  have all of your policy numbers available when requesting Opt-Out Forms). A  form will be mailed to your attention. Please verify that all of your Farmers  policy numbers are listed. If not, please add the policy numbers on the form  and mail to the return address printed on the form. We will implement your  request within a reasonable time after we receive the form. </p>
<p><b>Modifications to our Privacy Policy</b>
</p><p>We reserve the right to change our privacy practices in the  future, which may include sharing nonpublic personal information about you with  nonaffiliated third parties. Before we do that, we will provide you with a  revised privacy notice and give you the opportunity to opt out of that type of  information sharing.

</p><p><b>Web site Privacy Policy Statement Use of Information You Give Us</b>
</p><p><b>General Statement</b>
</p><p>Farmersâ policy is to protect the confidentiality of the individually identifiable information that you provide, and to limit access to that information only to those with a need to know.  Farmers may collect your name, address, phone number and e-mail address at this site. We will use this information to provide you information you request, to refer you to a Farmers agent, to refer you to a third party service provider or to comply with a legal requirement.  <strong>When you encounter a screen in this site that asks for information you do not want us to have or use, you should not proceed further with that screen.</strong> 
</p><p><b>Hyperlinks</b>
</p><p>We have agreements with third parties that allow you to go to  their web site from our Web Site. If you go to these sites from our site, you  may be asked to give non-public personal information for access to their  services or products. You may become a part of that business' customer base and  be subject to their policies regarding the handling of customer data. 
</p><p>Please be aware that Farmers is not  responsible for the privacy practices of those sites, even though Farmers' name  or logo may appear on those sites. We encourage you to be aware of this when  you leave our site and to read the Privacy Statements of each and every web  site that you visit, as the privacy policy of those sites may differ from ours.  Our privacy statement applies solely to our Web Site. </p>
<p><b>Security</b>
</p><p>Our policy is to restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you  only to those employees who need to know that information to provide products  or services to you or to provide necessary technical support. We require the  employees with access to your nonpublic personal information, including your  social security numbers, to use  safeguards against unauthorized access, use and unlawful disclosure. We require our employees to  adhere to high standards of ethics and integrity in performing their jobs and  conducting business. We also require the same standards of confidentiality from  the service vendors that assist us. Farmers uses no  encryption (data scrambling) on public portions of the Site and up to 2048-bit  encryption on other portionsâtypically, where you can enter personally  identifiable information. When you are on any web site that asks you for  confidential information, you should check to see if the information being  transmitted is encrypted in order to increase the security of your information.
</p><p><b>Logging</b>
</p><p>In addition to the information you provide us, we collect  information about your activities while you are at our site. While you are  logged in our site, we log IP addresses (a number assigned to your computer  when you use the Internet), browser and platform types, domain names, access  times, referral data (the last site or URL you visited before logging into our  site and the first site or URL you visit after leaving our site), and your  activity while using or reviewing our site. We obtain the information by using  cookies. 
</p><p><b>Cookies</b>
</p><p>A  cookie is a message sent to your browser from a Web server that is stored on  your computer's hard drive. The message is sent back to the Web server whenever  the browser requests a page from that server. Many commercial Internet sites  use cookies. While a code in the cookie file enables the site to label you as a  particular user, it does not identify you by name or address unless you have  provided the site with such information or set up preferences in your browser  to do so automatically. You may opt out of accepting cookies by changing the  settings on your browser. However, rejecting cookies may prevent you from using  certain functions and you may have to repeatedly enter information to take  advantage of services or promotions. In general, cookies allow us to identify  you as a particular user and thus provide you with a more customized service.  We may also use cookies to track customer or user requests, inquiries and  traffic patterns or to determine audience size and repeated usage. Farmers  Insurance uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online  advertising. These files enable us to recognize a  unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which  advertisements bring users to our website. With both cookies and Spotlight  technology to measure online advertising, the information that we collect and  share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your  name, address, telephone number, or email address. 

</p><p><b>Right to Preserve and Disclose</b>
</p><p>Farmers may  preserve for any period of time it deems appropriate all information you  provide.&nbsp; Farmers may also disclose  information you provide if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief  that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:&nbsp; (a) complete your transaction; (b) comply  with legal process; (c) enforce this Agreement; (d) respond to claims that any  materials on this Site violate your rights or the rights of third parties; (e)  protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Farmers, its users and/or  the public; or (f) in the event that all or substantially all of Farmers assets  are acquired by a third party.
</p><p><strong>Modifications </strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right, at any time, to  change or modify our policies on the use of information you provide us, and will post the revised  policy on our Web Site.
