<p>We collect aggregate information on what pages users access or visit, limited user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, information volunteered by the user, such as survey information and/or site registrations.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Unregistered users</p>
<p>If you do not register when you visit FareCompare, the information we collect from you is limited to your IP address in order to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Web site and track usage statistics. All information we collect from unregistered users and is used only in aggregate and used to generate overall reports on our visitors, but not reports about individual visitors.</p>
<p>We also use “cookies” and/or similar technology to enhance user experience.

However, unless you register with us, it contains no personally identifiable information that would allow us to identify you. Cookies cannot be used to read data off of your hard drive, and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by other Web sites. We use cookies in this manner to help us understand how visitors use our site, and to help us to improve our site. You may refuse to accept a cookie from us by following the procedures specific to your Web browser. Although you may do so, you may find that your browser reacts strangely when visiting not only our Web site, but other Web sites as well.</p>

<h3>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to change this policy should we deem it advisable to do so. If we make material changes that will affect personal information we have already collected from you, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the changes and to give you the opportunity to amend or cancel your registration.</p>
