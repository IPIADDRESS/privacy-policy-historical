<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
			
<p>Infoplease is committed to protecting the privacy and security of
its online visitors.  We are also extremely sensitive to family and
educator concerns about their children's personal information and
safety.  We want you to know about and understand the measures we have
taken to keep Infoplease a safe and secure environment for everyone.
This privacy statement tells you how and why we collect information
from you, and how we use that information.  Please note that your use
of this Site is also subject to the <a href="termsofuse.html">Terms of
Use</a> (of which this privacy statement is a part) posted on this
site.</p>

<p>We encourage our visitors to read through and understand our
privacy statement.  We may update it from time to time to address new
issues or reflect changes on our site.  Please refer to this privacy
statement regularly.  Infoplease reserves the right to revise this
privacy statement at any time and such revisions shall be effective
immediately upon notice thereof.  Notice may be given by any means
including, but not limited to, posting the revised privacy statement
on this site.  Any use of our site by you subsequent to such notice
shall be deemed to constitute acceptance by you of such revision.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the statement, please
use our <a href="/contact.html">web form</a> to contact us.</p>

<p>Infoplease is a division of Pearson Education, Inc.</p>

<h2>Information You Provide to Us</h2>

<p>Infoplease collects information in several ways via different parts
of our site.  Providing personal information and becoming a Infoplease
member is voluntary.  Nonmembers can still use the majority of our
site.  However, nonmembers will not have the opportunity to access
certain enhanced content and application areas, win our seasonal
promotions, experience future personalization, and voice their
questions and concerns as quickly.  When you register with Infoplease,
you provide personal information.  Infoplease uses this information to
better create and organize our content programming to meet your needs.</p>

<p>The personally identifiable information we may request from you,
and with which we identify you as a member, includes the following:
first name, last name, email address, gender, date of birth, ZIP code,
username, and password.</p>

<p>Please note: Children under the age of 13 and non-US residents
currently cannot become Infoplease members.</p>

<h2>How We Use the Information You Provide</h2>

<p>Infoplease uses your personal information to tailor the content
programming, information services, and software applications that we
provide to meet your needs and interests.  When you conduct a
transaction through this site, you are providing transaction
information to Infoplease's third party suppliers (such as transaction
processors and financial institutions) who will use the information
solely for the purpose of the transaction.  Finally, there may also be
other third party vendors who supply software applications, web
hosting and other technologies for this site that may have access to
your personal information but they will never use such information for
any other purpose except to provide services in connection with this
site.  Infoplease will not share any personal information about you
with any third party (a party not affiliated with Pearson Education,
Inc.), except as otherwise stated herein and in the following
circumstances: (a) in response to subpoenas, court orders or legal
process, to the extent permitted and as restricted by law; (b) when
disclosure is required to maintain the security and integrity of this
site, or to protect any user's security or the security of other
persons, consistent with applicable laws; (c) when disclosure is
directed or consented to by the registered member who has inputted the
personal information; (d) in the event that Infoplease itself or any
of its subdivisions or units goes through a business transition, such
as a merger, divestiture, acquisition, liquidation or sale of all or a
portion of its assets, your personal information will, in most
instances, be part of the assets transferred; or (e) in limited
circumstances, Infoplease may disclose your email address in order to
comply with laws and regulations, including the Controlling the
Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM of
2003).  Infoplease may occasionally involve a paying or nonpaying
partner in our registration areas because they share our educational
mission and they provide a highly valued service to our members.</p>

<p>Infoplease also collects non-personally identifiable information.
Here, no audience members are identified by their personal information
â€” we are only interested in how Infoplease looks demographically and
statistically.  This basic market research allows us to identify the
trends, developments, and needs of our audience.  Such information may
be shared with third parties.</p>

<h2>We Protect Kids' Privacy</h2>

<p>Infoplease encourages parents and guardians to spend time online
with their children.  We urge parents to instruct their children to
never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers without
permission when using the Internet.  We recognize a special obligation
to protect personal information obtained from children.</p>

<p>As a parent, you've probably done a lot of thinking about
protecting your family's privacy on the Internet.  We have been
thinking and working hard to provide you with the best information and
the highest quality interaction on the Internet in an environment that
is safe.  In compliance with COPPA (the Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act), we have adopted the following policies to keep kids
safe (there are a few exceptions to these policies as noted below
under the heading "Exceptions to Verifiable Parental Consent"):</p>

<ol>
<li>We will NOT knowingly collect, use, or distribute personally
identifiable information from children under the age of 13 without
prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.</li>

<li>Personally identifiable information we collect from children under
the age of 13 will be used solely by Infoplease or its agents for
internal purposes only and will NOT be sold or otherwise distributed
to third parties.</li>

<li>We will NOT knowingly allow children under the age of 13 access to
chat rooms, message boards, email accounts, or other services within
Infoplease that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise
distribute personally identifiable information without prior
verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.</li>

<li>We will NOT knowingly ask a child under the age of 13 to divulge
more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game,
or service.</li>

<li>We will NOT knowingly keep any personally identifiable information
that is inadvertently included in a child's email submission, help
inquiry, or other one-time request, if we know that the child is under
the age of 13.  Information will be automatically purged or purged
immediately after the issue has been resolved.</li>

<li>We will NOT knowingly post any personally identifiable information
that is inadvertently included in a child's submission to a general
audience contribution area if we know that the child is under the age
of 13.  These submissions will be deleted and handled anonymously
thereafter.</li>

<li>We will NOT knowingly provide any direct link to websites that are
unsuitable for children or teens.</li>

<li>We will advise children under the age of 13 that they MUST obtain
permission from their parent or guardian before sharing ANY personal
information.</li>

<li>Upon request, Infoplease will provide a parent or guardian with a
description of the information that may have been provided about their
child during a registration process for a program or service of this
site.  Infoplease only asks for a child's or teen's personal
information if it is necessary to participate in the program or
service.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Notification and Verifiable Parental Consent</h3>

<p>Before any personally identifiable information is collected, we
will do our best to notify the parent or guardian that their child is
participating.  Notification will include the exact nature and
intended use of the information we are collecting, as well as the
opportunity for the parent or guardian to prevent the use of the
information and the child's participation in the activity.  For every
child (anyone under 13 years of age) we require the parent or guardian
to provide verifiable parental consent such as an email, mail-in
letter, fax, or toll-free phone call to Infoplease.</p>

<h3>Exceptions to Verifiable Parental Consent</h3>

<p>There are few instances where we will NOT get verifiable parental
consent, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Requesting the contact information of a parent or guardian for the
sole purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing
notification to the parent or guardian;</li>

<li>Collecting a child's contact information solely to directly
respond to the child's request on a one-time basis (for example, to
provide assistance with a particular study question),. We will not use
that information to re-contact the child for any other purpose (we
will purge from our system the child's personal information after
responding);</li>

<li>Collecting a child's contact information and the contact
information of his/her parent or guardian solely to directly respond
more than once to a specific request from the child (for example, to
satisfy the request for a newsletter subscription). In this instance,
the parent or guardian will be notified that the child made such a
request and be informed of the information provided by the child. The
parent or guardian will have an opportunity at any time to revoke the
child's request (i.e., unsubscribe). We will not use the child's
personal information to re-contact the child for any other
purpose.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>

<p>The use of "cookies" is common in the Internet industry; you'll
find them used on Infoplease, as you will at other major websites.
"Cookies" are small text files written to your computer.  They make
our website easier for you to use because they save your preferences
while you are visiting our sites (although we do not save passwords in
cookies).  Cookies also help us know which areas are your favorites,
which areas need improvement, and what technologies and Internet
services our visitors are using.  Knowing this information helps us
continually improve the online experience for our visitors and
members.</p>

<p>The non-personally identifiable information we track with cookies
is anonymous and is not used to identify, or lead us back to, any
particular visitor.  Visitors to Infoplease may have the option of
disabling cookies via their browser preferences (most browsers are
initially set up to accept cookies).  While browsing through
Infoplease, you may get cookies from our advertisers or sponsors.
Infoplease and its affiliated sites do not control these cookies.</p>

<h2>What Are IP Addresses?</h2>

<p>An IP address is a number that is assigned automatically to your
computer whenever you use the World Wide Web.  Web servers -- the big
computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically identify your
computer by its IP address.  Infoplease collects IP addresses for
system administration; to report aggregate information to our
advertisers, sponsors, and partners; and to audit the use of our site.
When visitors request pages from Infoplease sites, our servers log the
guests' IP addresses.  We do not link IP addresses to
anything personally identifiable.  This means that a visitor's session
will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us.  We can and
will use IP addresses to identify a visitor if the following occurs:
(a) in response to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, to the
extent permitted and as restricted by law; (b) when disclosure is
required to maintain the security and integrity of this site, or to
protect any user's security or the security of other persons,
consistent with applicable laws</p>

<h2>A Notice About Our Advertisers:</h2>

<p>Some of the Infoplease sites allow advertising by third parties.
Infoplease does not control linking practices of advertisers or
sponsors and does not monitor or claim responsibility for any content
or privacy practices of such websites.  Once you have clicked on an
advertisement and have left the Infoplease site, you must read the
privacy policy of the advertiser or sponsor to see how your personal
information will be handled.</p>

<p>Infoplease may offer contests, sweepstakes, and promotions that are
sponsored by third-party advertisers or sponsors.  These third parties
may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors
voluntarily submit to participate in the activity.  Infoplease does
not control the third parties' use of information.</p>

<p>Infoplease may use an advertising server developed by a third party
to display ads on our site.  Some of these ads may contain cookies
that are set by third parties (advertisers, sponsors).  We do not have
access to these cookies or any information that they contain.  The
Infoplease privacy policy does not cover any use of information that a
third-party ad server may have collected from you.</p>

<h2>A Notice About External Links</h2>

<p>Occasionally, you will find links from Infoplease to independently
owned, controlled, and/or managed Websites whose content we believe
will be of possible interest and value to our visitors.  Additionally,
you'll see links from advertisers, sponsors, and other partners who
may use Infoplease's logo as part of a co-branding agreement.</p>

<p>In many cases, these links represent cooperative projects or mutual
links established with the organizations connected with these sites.
We don't control the content of these links.  These other sites may
send you their own cookies, collect data, or solicit personal
information.  While we identify sponsor and advertiser areas of our
Websites, we do not control these cookies or the content of these
third parties.</p>

<p>Infoplease has partnered with other companies to provide certain
services.  In some cases, you may see Infoplease's logo on another
company's site.  Infoplease does not share any of your personally
identifiable information with these partners and they do not share any
information with us.</p>

<p>Once you leave our servers (you can generally tell where you are by
checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), the use of any
information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the
operator of the site you are visiting.  That policy may differ from
ours.  If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via
a link from that site's Home page, you should contact the site
directly for more information.</p>

<p>We specifically recommend that children check with their parents or
teachers before connecting to any new sites.</p>

<h2>Public Forums:</h2>

<p>Infoplease makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, web pages,
and/or news groups available to its users.  Please remember that any
information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public
information.  Consequently, you should exercise caution when deciding
to disclose your personal information.</p>

<h2>Contacting Infoplease</h2>

<p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of Infoplease, or your dealings with Infoplease, please
use our <a href="/contact.html">web form</a> to contact us.</p>
