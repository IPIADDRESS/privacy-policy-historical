        PRIVACY POLICY</font></b></p>
      <p align="left">Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your 
        experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and 
        we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and 
        opportunities with complete confidence. </p>
      <p align="left">We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm 
        commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how 
        our company collects information from all end users of our Internet services 
        (the "Services")-those who access some of our Services but do 
        not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who may purchase 
        Products and/or pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service 
        ("Members")-what we do with the information we collect, and 
        the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use 
        of such information. We request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is 
        Used</p>
      <p align="left">Introduction. Our company collects information in different 
        ways from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services 
        and the network of Web sites accessible through our Service. </p>
      <p align="left">Registration: Members may be asked to provide certain personal 
        information when they sign up for our Products or Services including name, 
        address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card 
        number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. 
        The personal information collected from Members during the registration 
        process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes). 
        This information may be shared with third parties, as stated herein, or 
        in special circumstances.</p>
      <p align="left"> However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly 
        promote our Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information, 
        such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the 
        Services as a result of the joint promotion for the purpose of offering 
        you other products and services.</p>
      <p align="left">In this instance, personal information may not be used by 
        the partner for any other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying 
        and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during 
        registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). 
        As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying 
        information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services. </p>
      <p align="left">Also, with purchases, we supply our member's contact information, 
        to our business partners, who then may contact the member by telephone 
        after the member purchase. Sales proceeds are collected by the that business 
        partner company. We also may supply other companies with contact information, 
        for mail offers we believe would be of interest to our members, with or 
        without compensation from those companies. At times we may send an advertisement 
        for a third party product, where we collect the sales proceeds, and forward 
        the purchaser's information to that third party.</p>
      <p align="left">Our Company Partners and Sponsors: Some products and services 
        may be offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, 
        independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors 
        and Members some of these products and services, the partner may need 
        to collect and maintain personal information. </p>
      <p align="left">Online Shopping: At some Web sites, you can purchase products 
        and services or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog 
        or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to 
        provide contact information, such as your name, address, email address, 
        phone number, and credit/debit card information. </p>
      <p align="left">If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online 
        gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information 
        about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone 
        number. Our company has no control over the third parties' use of any 
        personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise 
        care when doing so. </p>
      <p align="left">If you order services or products directly from our company, 
        we use the personal information you provide to process that order. We 
        do share this information with outside parties that we do business with.</p>
      <p align="left">Online Advertisements: Our company may display our online 
        advertisements. In those cases we share information about our Visitors 
        and Members collected through the registration process as well as through 
        online surveys and promotions with these advertisers. </p>
      <p align="left">Additionally, in some instances, we use this information 
        to deliver tailored advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an 
        advertiser or joint venture company tells us the audience they want to 
        reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based 
        upon the information we have collected, we may then display or send the 
        advertisement to the intended audience. Our company does share personal 
        information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers or joint 
        venture companies.</p>
      <p align="left">Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send 
        email inquiries to our company, the return email address is used to answer 
        the email inquiry we receive. </p>
      <p align="left">Voluntary Customer Surveys: We may periodically conduct 
        both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers 
        to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important 
        information that helps us to improve the types of products and services 
        we offer and how we provide them to you. </p>
      <p align="left">We may take the information we receive from individuals 
        responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with 
        the responses of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic 
        responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, 
        education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). 
        We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services 
        to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally 
        identifying information may be shared with third parties.</p>
      <p align="left">Promotions: Our company may offer polls, contests, sweepstakes, 
        drawings, games, content, or other promotions that are sponsored by or 
        cobranded with third parties. You may be entered in a sweepstakes, contest, 
        or other promotion, simply by making a purchase from us or by providing 
        us with personally identifiable information for some other reason or purpose. 
        Due to these third party relationships, the third parties may obtain personally 
        identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to our company. 
        Our company has no control over third parties' use of this information. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Additionally, personally identifiable information may be 
        collected when you order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise 
        express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online 
        newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. 
        The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected 
        at these pages include but may not be limited to: name, address, e-mail 
        address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information 
        about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. 
        Our sponsors or third parties may send you material that relates to our 
        company's services, products or activities.</p>
      <p align="left">Special Cases: It is our company's policy to use or share 
        the personal information about Visitors or Members in ways described herein 
        without additional notice or means to opt out or otherwise prohibit such 
        unrelated uses. </p>
      <p align="left">Also, we may disclose personal information about Visitors 
        or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites 
        accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, 
        we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: credit agencies, 
        collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law enforcement, or to 
        satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Child 
        Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for 
        such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, 
        contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our 
        Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service, or other user policies; to 
        operate the Services properly; or to protect our company and our Members.
