							Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Proxy42 Inc. ("Proxy42", "we," or "us") and our web site located at <a href="http://www.father.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.father.io</a>, as well as all related web sites, devices, mobile applications and other services provided by us and on which a link to this Privacy Policy (this "Policy") is displayed (collectively, the "Service").
							<br>
							This Policy describes the information that we gather from you on the Service, how we use and disclose such information, and the steps we take to protect such information. We use information collected from cookies and other technologies to improve your user experience and the overall quality of the Service. By using the Service, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy.
							<br>
							This Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Proxy42 Terms of Use. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy have the meaning given to them in the Proxy42 Terms of Use.
						</p>
						<h4>The information we collect on the Service:</h4>
						<p>
							<strong>User-provided Information.</strong> When you use the Service, you may provide and we may collect what is generally called "personally identifiable" information, or "personal information," which is information that specifically identifies an individual. Examples of personal information include name, email address, mailing address, mobile phone number, and credit card or other billing information. Personal information also includes other information, such as date of birth, geographic area, or preferences, when any such information is linked to information that identifies a specific individual. You may provide us with personal information in various ways on the Service. For example, you provide us with personal information when you register for an account, use the Service, post user content, make a purchase on the Service, interact with other users of the Service through communication or messaging features, or send us customer service-related requests.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>"Cookies" Information.</strong> When you use the Site, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>"Automatically Collected" Information.</strong> When you use the Service, we may automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including "clear gifs" or "web beacons." This "automatically collected" information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Third Party Web Beacons.</strong> We may also implement third-party content or advertising on the Site that may use clear gifs or other forms of web beacons, which allow the third-party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Site. Information collected through web beacons is collected directly by these third parties, and Proxy42 does not participate in that data transmission.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Integrated Services.</strong> You may be given the option to access or register for the Service through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each, an "Integrated Service"), such as through the use of your online banking credentials, or otherwise have the option to authorize an Integrated Service to provide personal information or other information to us. By authorizing us to connect with an Integrated Service, you authorize us to access and store your name, email address(es), date of birth, gender, current city, account numbers and any other information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Service's terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Service.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Location Information.</strong> Proxy 42 may offer certain features as part of the Service in whole or in part based on your location, such as to locate the mobile device on which you have installed, or downloaded an application that is a part of the Service. You will be given the opportunity to opt-in to location-based services, normally through an opt-in screen on the application. If you choose to enable location-based services, we may collect your location based on information provided by you or the mobile device, including, if available, GPS, IP address or cell tower information. If you do not opt-in to or choose to disable location-based services, you may not be able to utilize certain features of the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, even if you have not expressly granted us access to location data, we may nonetheless have access to location information contained in the transaction data associated with your Inceptor Device.
						</p>
						<p>
							&nbsp;
						</p>
						<p>
							Information from Other Sources. We may obtain information, including personal information, from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners, advertisers, and Integrated Services. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information in accordance with this Policy.
						</p>

						</p>
						<p>
							We use the information that we collect on the Service to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the Service, and to develop new products, services, feature, and functionality.
						</p>
						<p>
							We may use your email address or other information we collect on the Service (i) to contact you for administrative purposes such as customer service, to address intellectual property infringement, right of privacy violations or defamation issues related to your User Content posted on the Service or (ii) to send communications, including updates on promotions and events, relating to products and services offered by us and by third parties we work with.

							We also reserve the right to disclose your information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to (i) take precautions against liability, (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity, (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, (iv) protect the security or integrity of the Service and any facilities or equipment used to make the Service available, or (v) protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights, property, or safety of others.
						</p>
						<p>
							Information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, or successor or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.

						<h4>Third-Party Services</h4>
						<p>

						<p>
							Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.

						<p>
							We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to improve the integrity and security of your personally identifiable information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
