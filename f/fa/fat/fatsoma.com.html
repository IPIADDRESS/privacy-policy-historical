						The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").

Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. Fatsoma will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.<br><br>
						All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted (using SSL technology).

We ask you not to share a password with anyone.<br><br>
						Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
