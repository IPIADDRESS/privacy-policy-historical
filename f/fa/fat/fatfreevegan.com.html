      Many recipes posted on <a href="http://FatFreeVegan.com">FatFreeVegan.com</a>

          about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and
          the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information.
          This
          privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use

      <p><b><font size="2" face="verdana">FatfreeVegan.Com gathers two types of information
          about users:</font></b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="verdana">Information that users provide through
            optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions
            to register for the main website, to participate in our message
            boards or forums, and from participation in polls
            and surveys:

        </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="verdana">Information FatfreeVegan.Com gathers through
            aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views
            throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor
            our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors
            better understand the demographics of our audience. Because
          FatfreeVegan.Com derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing
            such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service
            free to users. Under no circumstances does FatfreeVegan.Com divulge any information
            about an individual user to a third party.</font></li>

      <p><b><font size="2" face="verdana">FatfreeVegan.Com Gathers User Information In
          The Following Processes:</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2" face="verdana">Optional Voluntary Information</font></b></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana">We offer the following free services,
          which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information
          by users:</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana">1. Registered member/forums policy</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana">Users of the site must register (free of
          charge) in order to post recipes and forum messages, although they needn't register to
          visit the site. During registration the user is required to supply
          a username, password, and email address.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2. Polling and recipe ratings</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana">We may offer interactive polls and the
      opportunity to rate recipes to users
          so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what
          our audience thinks about individual recipes. Opinions or other responses
          to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular
          user. FatfreeVegan.Com may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted,
          so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not
          correlated with information about individual users.</font></p>
      <p><b><font size="2" face="verdana">Usage tracking</font></b></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana">FatfreeVegan.Com tracks user traffic patterns
          throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information
          with data about individual users. FatfreeVegan.Com does break down overall usage
          statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME
          type by reading this information from the browser string (information
          contained in every user's browser).</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana">FatfreeVegan.Com sometimes tracks and catalogs
          the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this
          tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking
          information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't
          like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual
          users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps
          us continue to build a better service for you.</font></p>
      <p><b><font size="2" face="verdana">Cookies</font></b></p>

          provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is
          information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your
          hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.
      FatfreeVegan.Com uses
          cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising
          system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and

      <h3><b><font size="2" face="verdana">USE OF INFORMATION</font></b></h3>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana">FatfreeVegan.Com uses any information voluntarily
          given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites,

          users voluntarily provide in order to enable users to participate in
      polls and forums and submit recipes.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana">When we use tracking information to determine
          which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic
          to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather
          how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build
          a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function
          as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't track
          which terms a particular user enters.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana">FatfreeVegan.Com creates aggregate reports
          on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors
          and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively,
          and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to
          their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual
          users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user
          clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual
          user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or
          to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</font></p>
