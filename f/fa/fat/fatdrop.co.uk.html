  information such as your name, postal and e-mail addresses, contact telephone 
  numbers, date of birth, gender and other lifestyle information. </p>
  <p>4. Use of personal Information <br>
  4.1 We may use personal information for: administrative, operational and marketing 
  purposes and to communicate with you about your use of the Services any changes 
  to the Services. We will only pass on your information to other companies if 
  it is necessary to perform the Services or with your prior consent. Those companies 
  may contact you to inform you of their services and products. Any personal information

  which enables us to record anonymous details and allows you to move around the

  may be transferred in transit to countries outside the European Economic Area

  as set out in this policy. However, we do our best to ensure that your personal 
  information is secure. </p>

  <p>8.1 As required by under UK data protection laws, we follow strict security 
  procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given 
  to us, to prevent unauthorised access. We use industry standard technology to 
  encrypt your personal information. However, the Internet is not a secure environment 
  and we cannot guarantee the security of any information which you send to us.</p>
