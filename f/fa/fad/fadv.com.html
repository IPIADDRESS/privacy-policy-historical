<p><strong>How We Use and Collect Information in Our Various Businesses  &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A number of First Advantage businesses are consumer  reporting agencies (CRAs) operating in accordance with the requirements of the  Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). FCRA establishes the following principles for  all CRAs:<br>
Privacy: Information about you may only be furnished to  third parties that have a permissible purpose. In general, these deal with  credit, employment, insurance, rental or banking transactions initiated by you,  or where the object is to make a firm offer to you. CRAs must qualify their  customers to make certain that they have a permissible purpose to receive the  information. </p>
<p><strong>Access: </strong>Consumers may receive a copy of information the CRA  maintains about them. Such reports can be obtained free of charge once per year  or for a reasonable fee for additional disclosures. Please visit the applicable  subsidiary Web sites to obtain more information. </p>
<p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> CRAs must follow reasonable procedures to assure  accuracy of the information they maintain and furnish. When you obtain a copy  of your information, you have a right to dispute and have the information  reinvestigated and corrected in the CRAs database. </p>
<p><strong>Fairness:</strong> Information is obtained from various sources  including public records sources. However, certain information over a specified  time period may not be reported. </p>
<p><strong>Accountability:</strong> The Federal Trade Commission is charges with  overseeing the operations of CRAs and enforcing FCRA requirements. </p>
<p>First Advantage companies subject to FCRA operate within  this framework. If you would like to obtain a report about the information we  have about you, please call 800-845-6004 or go to  http://www.fadv.com/free-report-for-consumers.aspx. </p>

<p><a name="Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Policy"></a><strong>First Advantage Privacy Vision&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>First Advantage is committed to the responsible use of  information and protecting individual privacy rights.&nbsp; First Advantage  strives to provide services to businesses, consumers, nonprofit organizations  and government agencies that help reduce fraud, mitigate risk, facilitate more  informed decisions, and make society safer, in ways that protect consumer  privacy.&nbsp; We aspire to protect consumer privacy through the design of our  products, by credentialing, monitoring, and auditing our customers as  appropriate, and through other information security safeguards.&nbsp; We also  strive to promote transparency through consumer education initiatives, privacy  principles and policies, and appropriate opportunities for consumer choice,  access, and correction with respect to personal information about the consumer.</p>
<p><strong>Data Privacy Principles</strong></p>
<p>The First Advantage Data Privacy Principles speak to the  personally identifiable information including sensitive personally identifiable  information, collected, maintained, used or disseminated in connection with  services offered by First Advantage, or by its affiliates (all hereinafter  "First Advantage").</p>
<p>First Advantage applies these Principles to our domestic  U.S. products and services where appropriate.&nbsp; In addition, other uses or  disclosures may occur as required by applicable law, such as the Fair Credit  Reporting Act and its state analogues ("FCRA"), the Driver’s Privacy  Protection Act and its state analogues (“DPPA”), and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act  (“GLB”).&nbsp; If the law requires or upon request of law enforcement, or, if  necessary, to prevent fraud or to protect our computer systems, these  principles may not apply. First Advantage also, from time to time, may revise  our Data Privacy Principles by posting changes on its Web site.</p>
<p>1. SECURITY</p>
<p>Data security is a company imperative.&nbsp; First Advantage strives to protect  personally identifiable information that we maintain or disseminate, including  through the use of appropriate administrative, physical, and technical  safeguards, so it is not obtained by unauthorized individuals or used  impermissibly.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</p>
<p>First Advantage seeks to limit the distribution of personally identifiable  information consistent with the nature and sensitivity of the information. In  its services, First Advantage also strives to make available personally  identifiable information from sources other than public records or publicly  available information only to its authorized users or customers. Similarly,  where applicable, First Advantage strives to restrict access to information in  accordance with privacy laws such as the FCRA, the GLB, and the DPPA and comparable  state statutes. In the case of public record information available to the  general public (such as bankruptcy, liens, judgments, criminal records and  Uniform Commercial Code filings) and publicly available information (such as  telephone directory information or personal information available through  widely available media), we may make this information available to the general  public unless applicable law operates to limit our distribution of such  information to authorized users.</p>
<p>If, upon investigation, First Advantage finds that  personally identifiable information has been used or accessed inappropriately  or unlawfully, First Advantage strives to take reasonable steps to stop the  misuse or access, educate the user concerning the appropriate use of the information,  and prevent similar future misuses. Such steps may include measures up to and  including discontinuation of the user’s access to First Advantage information  products and services, pursuit of other legal remedies, and the referral of  misuse to the appropriate authorities.</p>
<p>3. ACCURACY</p>
<p>First Advantage strives to accurately report information in its products. First  Advantage also strives to accurately report information that it receives from  its data sources. First Advantage recognizes, however, that reporting errors  may occur and offers consumers opportunities, where applicable, to dispute and  correct information that we report as discussed further in Principle 9 on  Access and Correction.</p>
<p>4. PROTECTION OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND DRIVER'S  LICENSE NUMBERS</p>
<p>First Advantage strives to provide additional safeguards for sensitive  personally identifiable information, such as Social Security numbers and  driver’s license numbers. First Advantage strives to limit the availability and  access to full Social Security Numbers ("SSNs"), Driver's License  Numbers and State Identification Numbers. First Advantage strives to protect  the confidentiality of SSNs by limiting access to SSNs to certain legitimate  and authorized users, such as: state, local and federal government entities;  financial institutions; insurers; employers; creditors; debt collectors and  other user types to which First Advantage may decide to provide such access. A  limited number of public records may contain SSNs that are already available to  the public and, if such public records are accessed through First Advantage  services, our services may provide access to such SSNs. First Advantage  prohibits the unlawful disclosure of SSNs. First Advantage also takes steps to  limit the availability of Driver's License Numbers ("DLNs") and state  identification card numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; EDUCATION</p>
<p>First Advantage strives to inform its employees, users and the general public  about appropriate use of First Advantage products and services.&nbsp; First  Advantage strives to inform its users and employees about:</p>

<p>The responsible use of personally  identifiable information.</p>
<p>First Advantage strives to inform the public about:</p>
<p>The responsible use of personally  identifiable information; and </p>
<p>Measures First Advantage has  undertaken to enhance consumer privacy; and choices available to consumers  regarding information access and the ability to opt-out of certain products and  services which utilize personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; REPUTABLE SOURCES</p>
<p>First Advantage strives to acquire personally identifiable information from  established, reputable sources in the government and private sectors. In  support of this Principle, First Advantage takes reasonable steps to assess the  reputation and reliability of its private sector data sources before  incorporating personally identifiable information from the source into its  products and services. First Advantage also strives to obtain assurances from  its data suppliers that they have the legal right to license or sell the data  to First Advantage.</p>

First Advantage strives to direct individuals to the government  and private entities that collect and maintain public records and publicly  available information to correct any claimed inaccuracies found in that data,  and to direct individuals to consumer reporting agencies where such agency is  the source of the information about the individual and where the individual  seeks to correct claimed inaccuracies found in that data.</p>
<p>10. ACCOUNTABILITY</p>

First Advantage believes that strong privacy and information  security protections are vital for an effective and trusted data industry.</p>

First  Advantage believes that it is important that individuals who may have had their  sensitive personally identifiable information acquired by an unauthorized individual  be notified as follows: Where a state law requires notice, First Advantage  complies with the law. In those states where notification laws do not exist,  First Advantage follows its Information Security Breach Response and  Notification Policy, which provides that affected individuals will be notified  when sensitive personally identifiable information owned or licensed by First  Advantage is acquired by an unauthorized individual and whenever First  Advantage has a reasonable basis to believe the breach has resulted in, or  there is a significant risk that it will result in, identity theft to the  consumer to whom the information relates.</p>
<p>13. COMPLIANCE</p>
<p>First Advantage will obtain assessments from a qualified, objective,  independent third-party, who uses procedures and standards generally accepted  in the profession to assess First Advantage' administrative, technical, and  physical safeguards, as appropriate.</p>

</strong><strong><a name="Europe"></a>European Union Safe  Harbor Privacy Policy </strong></p>
<p>First Advantage Corporation and First Advantage Corporation's  subsidiaries ("FADV") respect the privacy of our visitors and  clients. It is our policy to maintain the confidentiality and privacy of any  personal data voluntarily submitted to us in writing, submitted electronically  via our website, or submitted to us by our clients in connection with  employment background screening, credential verification, investigations,  credit and fraud risk management and other services.</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy ("Policy") applies  to personal information pertaining to an identified or identifiable individual  that is received by FADV from the European Union or other personal information  that FADV acquires pursuant to its performance of services for its clients or  other third parties to which FADV has contractually agreed to apply this  privacy policy ("EU Personal Data"). This Policy does not apply to:  (a) data collected and used by FADV which is not EU Personal Data; (b) the  subsidiaries of FADV which do not receive or process EU Personal Data or; (c)  data collected on any other subsidiary website not reasonably calculated to  capture EU Personal Data. Those subsidiary websites reasonably calculated to  capture EU Personal Data contain a link to this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>In the event of a conflict between this Policy and FADV's  obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et. seq.,  other statutes, regulations, or case law, or to the extent necessary to meet  national security, public interest or law enforcement requirements, adherence  to this Policy may be limited.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROVISIONS OF OUR SAFE HARBOR PRIVACY POLICY&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>FADV receives certain EU Personal Data at the request of  clients and other third parties for investigative, credential verification, and  employment related purposes, as well as credit and fraud risk mitigation  related purposes. FADV has joined the U.S. Department of Commerce's "Safe  Harbor" program with respect to EU Personal Data and utilizes such  information in accordance with the Safe Harbor principles. The Safe Harbor principles  and our Safe Harbor certification can be found at www.export.gov/safeharbor.  Our Policy addresses each of the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, as described  below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Notice &nbsp;</p>
<p>Where FADV collects EU Personal Data from individuals,  individuals are informed about the purposes for which it collects and uses EU  Personal Data about them, how to contact FADV with any inquiries or complaints,  the types of third parties to which it discloses the information and the  choices and means FADV offers individuals for limiting its use and disclosure.  Notice is provided in clear and conspicuous language either when individuals  are first asked to provide EU Personal Data or as soon thereafter as is  practicable, but in any event before FADV uses such information for a purpose  other than that for which it was originally collected or processed by the  transferring organization or discloses it for the first time to a third party  (other than agents acting under our instructions). Information about how FADV  collects and uses EU Personal Data also follows below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FADV gathers and maintains consumer and other data which it  provides to employers or their agents (such as recruiters or staffing firms)  for use in making employment-related decisions, such as who to hire, retain,  promote, or re-assign. FADV also gathers and maintains consumer and other data  which it provides to entities including lenders, credit reference agencies and  fraud prevention agencies. Provided below is an illustrative list of common  ways in which employers use the data provided by this service:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Performance of applicant and employee background checks  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Verification of the credentials of job applicants and  current employees &nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigation into a suspicion of work-related misconduct or  wrongdoing &nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigation into matters of employee compliance with  employer policies, or &nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigation into matters of employee compliance with  Federal, State, or local laws and regulations &nbsp;</p>
<p>Provided below is an illustrative list of common ways in  which lenders, credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies use the  data provided by this service:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authentication of consumer applicants for loans or other  credit services&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prevention or detection of fraud by consumer applicants for  loans or other credit services&nbsp;</p>
<p>Determination of credit worthiness or capacity of consumer  applicants for loans or other credit services&nbsp;</p>
<p>Location of absconded borrowers&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scope of this notice covers consumer report data that  FADV has obtained on behalf of employers and other businesses by manually or electronically  contacting the appropriate sources of the data (court records, references,  licensing bureaus, etc.). FADV also performs services related to corporate  litigation and investigative services as requested by our clients. &nbsp;</p>
<p>More information regarding the nature and scope of consumer  data inquiries is available by contacting FADV in writing or by e-mail at the  addresses listed on the <a href="/our-company/contact-support.aspx">Contact Us  page</a>&nbsp;or by writing to the contacts listed below. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Choice&nbsp;</p>
<p>FADV will offer individuals the opportunity to choose  (opt-out) whether their EU Personal Data will be disclosed to a third party  (not including our agents) or will be used for a purpose incompatible with the  purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the  individual. With respect to sensitive information, however, an individual must  "opt-in" to the disclosure of the information to a non-agent third  party or to the use of this information for a purpose other than its original  purpose or that purpose authorized subsequently by the individual. FADV will  provide individuals with reasonable mechanisms to exercise their choices should  requisite circumstances arise.</p>
<p>3. Onward Transfer (Transfers to Third Parties)&nbsp;</p>
<p>With respect to the transfer of EU Personal Data to third  parties (other than our agents), the principles of "Notice" and  "Choice" apply. Accordingly, EU Personal Data is only provided to  third parties for purposes described in the "Notice" section or  otherwise disclosed to consumers, and will not be disseminated to a third party  where a consumer has "opted-out" or, in the case of sensitive  information, failed to "opt-in." &nbsp;</p>
<p>FADV may disclose EU Personal Data clients and third  parties, which may include lenders, credit reference agencies, fraud prevention  agencies, employers or their agents, who certify that they subscribe to the  Safe Harbor Principles or the EU Data Protection Directive or a law subject to  an adequacy finding by the EU. FADV also may disclose EU Personal Data to  employer clients, other types of clients or their agents who enter into a  written agreement with FADV, in which the third party agrees to comply with the  FCRA, if applicable, and to provide at least the same level of privacy  protection as is required by the seven Safe Harbor Principles (in the instance  where EU Personal Data is requested). &nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Access&nbsp;</p>
<p>A consumer may request, in writing, access to all EU  Personal Data collected and maintained about him or her. FADV affords the  consumer a reasonable opportunity to correct, amend, or delete information that  is inaccurate or incomplete, except where the burden or expense of providing  access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual's privacy, or  where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.&nbsp;  In cases where the information is subject to the FCRA, FADV complies with the  FCRA's requirements regarding access and correction rights of  consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>FADV reserves the right to engage in reasonable efforts to  confirm the identity of the individual requesting EU Personal Data to ensure  the information is provided only to the subject of the data. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To request information relating to his or her EU Personal  Data, a consumer may contact FADV in writing or by e-mail at the following  email address,&nbsp;privacy@fadv.com, or by writing to the contacts listed  below. In addition, the consumer will be asked to provide sufficient evidence  of his or her identity so we may ensure that information is being released to  the correct individual. If we are unable to provide the consumer with access to  his or her EU Personal Data or to correct the data, we will notify the  consumer.</p>
<p>5. Security&nbsp;</p>
<p>FADV takes reasonable procedures to protect EU Personal Data  from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and  destruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Data Integrity&nbsp;</p>
<p>FADV collects EU Personal Data that is relevant for the  purposes for which it is to be used, consistent with the Safe Harbor  Principles.&nbsp; We process EU Personal Data in ways that are compatible with  the purposes for which it has been collected (as identified in the Notice  section above) or subsequently authorized by the individual.&nbsp; To the  extent necessary for those purposes, FADV takes reasonable steps to ensure that  EU Personal Data collected is accurate, complete, current, and reliable for its  intended use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Enforcement&nbsp;</p>
<p>FADV will verify adherence to the EU Safe Harbor Policy via  in-house verification and internal policies and procedures implemented by the  management of our company. FADV also will cooperate with an independent third  party as a means of providing consumers a readily available and affordable  recourse mechanism by which individual consumer complaints and disputes, if  any, can be investigated and remedied.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Amendments&nbsp;</p>
<p>From time to time, this Privacy Policy may be amended to  reflect new products and services, or as necessary to reflect a new business  practice.&nbsp; Consistent with the Safe Harbor requirements, we will post any  revised policy on this website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>FADV affords individuals the opportunity to choose whether  their Switzerland Personal Data will be disclosed to a third party (not  including our agents) or will be used for a purpose incompatible with the  purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the  individual. Therefore, consumer data may be disseminated under these  circumstances unless the consumer explicitly "opts-out."

<p><a name="Australia-New-Zealand"></a><strong>Australian and New Zealand Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Last updated: March 14, 2014 </strong></p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong> </p>
<p>First Advantage Australia Pty Ltd ACN 101 863 209 and First Advantage New Zealand Limited ("First Advantage", "we", "us" or "our") provides a background screening service for its clients (“Client”), to assist them in considering individuals for employment, change in the level of responsibility, other circumstances where an individual's background is relevant (including but not limited to insurance and claims review), or to determine if further verification or investigation is necessary.&nbsp; This is achieved by preparing an employment, investigative, or due diligence report for the Client.</p>
<p>This policy may change from time to time. Please check the policy each time you use our Web site for the most current information. </p>
<p>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOLD </p>
<p>As part of our services, we receive information about individuals for the purposes of conducting our checks. </p>
<p>Some of this information may be "personal information" for the purposes of the Australian and New Zealand Privacy Acts: Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Australian Privacy Act) &amp; Privacy Act 1993 No. 28 (New Zealand Privacy Act) (collectively referred to as the “Act”). "Personal information" is defined (i) under the Australian Privacy Act, as "information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable: (a) whether the information or opinion is true or not; and (b) whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not", and (ii) under the New Zealand Privacy Act, as “Information about an identifiable individual; and includes information relating to a death that is maintained by the Registrar-General pursuant to the Births, Deaths, Marriages, and Relationship Registration Act 1995, or any former Act”. (“Personal Information”) <br>
Personal Information that we collect and hold about an individual will vary depending upon the background checks required by the Client and the information the individual supplies to us. Personal Information about an individual that we may collect and hold includes name, age, date of birth, employment history, reference information, education, professional qualifications, residency, sanctions, immigration status, claims, judgments, insolvency, current and previous directorships, character, personal reputation, and such other checks and enquiries as the Client considers necessary to verify information provided by an individual . </p>
<p>From Clients we may collect company address and the name, email and phone number of any system users.</p>
<p>From Clients and individuals, we may collect credit card payment details. </p>
<p>From the sources of our background checks we may collect the name and job title of the person who supplied us with the information. </p>
<p>We may also collect other Personal Information which is "sensitive information". Sensitive information is given a greater level of protection under the Act. The Act imposes greater obligations on us regarding any collection, use or disclosure we make of an individual’s sensitive information. </p>
<p>Sensitive information about an individual that we may collect and hold includes criminal records, and membership of a professional or trade association.</p>
<p>We recognise the importance of privacy issues and respect the confidentiality of the Personal Information and sensitive information individuals provide to us. We will collect and deal with Personal Information and sensitive information in accordance with the Act, and our Privacy Statement and this Privacy Policy (both as amended from time to time).<br>
<br>
<strong>MAIN PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE COLLECT, HOLD, USE AND DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong> </p>
<p>When engaged by a Client, First Advantage verifies an individual’s information, documentation and any responses by carrying out verification checks for the purposes of preparing an employment, investigative, or due diligence report. This is done at the Client’s request to enable them to assess an individual’s suitability for employment, promotion, provision of services, or other purposes in accordance with their legal obligations and internal risk management policy (including but not limited to insurance and claims review).<br>
In certain circumstances, First Advantage may be engaged by a Client to prepare an employment or investigative report because they are required by law to determine a candidate’s suitability for a position of employment, for example under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth).</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>In order to process and verify information for a Client's request, the Client and First Advantage may collect an individual’s Personal Information directly from the individual. We may also collect information about an individual from a third party a candidate refers us to. In these circumstances, we will assume that the individual has referred First Advantage to them and informed them of the purposes involved in the collection, use and disclosure of the relevant personal or other information.<br>
We may use the Personal Information, documentation and any responses an individual or third party reference has provided to us to apply to various other entities (“Sources”) for verification of an individual’s&nbsp; personal and other information, to collect additional Personal Information, and to conduct public record searches. Examples of Sources include, but are not limited to, government agencies, law enforcement bodies, publicly available records, public registries, court or tribunal records, insolvency registers, educational institutions, current and/or previous employers, and regulatory and licensing bodies.</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE HOLD PERSONAL INFORMATION </strong></p>
<p>The Personal Information provided to us by an individual, third party references, and any other Personal Information provided by the Sources, will be processed by us.<br>
First Advantage will then use the Personal Information to prepare a report outlining the findings of its investigations and provide the report to the Client via a secure means. The Client may then use that information to consider an individual’s suitability for employment, change in the level of responsibility, or other circumstances where an individual's background is relevant, or to determine if further verification or investigation is necessary. If a Fit and Proper report was requested, the Client may use this to determine the status as a Fit and Proper Person for purposes of an Australian Credit Licence. If the report was requested for insurance purposes, it may be used by the client to determine eligibility for insurance or for claims payments. </p>
<p>We store the Personal Information we receive in hard copy files and/or in electronic format in a database. </p>
<p>We take steps to protect against the loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration of Personal Information collected through this web site and otherwise subject to this policy. We recognize the importance of security for all personally identifiable information collected by First Advantage. Once we receive Personal Information, we take steps to protect its security on our systems. In the event we request or transmit sensitive information, we use industry standard, secure socket layer (SSL) encryption.</p>
<p>We limit access to personally-identifiable information to those employees who need this access in order to carry out their job responsibilities.</p>
<p>When we dispose of personally identifiable information, we use procedures to dispose of Personal Information by means such as shredding documents and erasure of electronic media that information cannot be practicably read or reconstructed. </p>
<p>We may need to retain Personal Information collected from an individual, third party references, or Sources to comply with our contractual, statutory or other legal obligations even after the employment or other application process is completed or terminated.</p>
<p><strong>IDENTIFIERS</strong> </p>
<p>An "identifier" is a unique identification number assigned to a candidate by the Commonwealth Government or a Commonwealth Government Agency. Examples of identifiers include a Tax File Number (TFN) or a Medicare number. First Advantage does not use identifiers to identify a candidate's personal information in our systems.</p>
<p><strong>OVERSEAS TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong> </p>
<p>We may disclose Personal Information to overseas recipients. The circumstances of disclosure may be as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li> We may need to disclose an individual’s Personal Information overseas in order to carry out our checks. For example, if an individual lived, studied or worked overseas, we may need to disclose that individual’s Personal Information overseas to liaise with Sources, employers, third party references, or educational institutions. Disclosures of this kind may be to any country in the world, depending upon the circumstances of the individual.</li>
    <li> We may also disclose an individual’s Personal Information to our related bodies corporate located overseas, most likely in Australia, India, Canada, New Zealand, the U.S. or the U.K. Personal Information may be disclosed to related bodies corporate located overseas for purposes including data storage, administrative purposes (creating internal and external reports, invoicing and trends in data), and operational and/or processing purposes in connection with the preparation of an employment or investigative report to the Client. </li>
</ul>

An individual may apply for that information by contacting the Privacy Officer at the contact details set out below. We will acknowledge receipt of a request for access. Where reasonable and practicable, we will provide access to Personal Information in the form requested by an individual. A moderate fee may be charged for this information.

<p>We will handle requests for access to Personal Information in accordance with the Act. However, in some circumstances permitted under the Act we may not be required to give an individual access to the information we hold about them.</p>
