	<h1>Student Aid Application Services Privacy Policy</h1>
	<br><br>

	<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
	<p>
		At Student Aid Application Services, LLC., we place a high priority on respecting and protecting the privacy of our customers. In particular, we believe it is important for you to know how we treat information about you that we may receive from this Website, because we want you to feel comfortable and confident when using it.
	</p><br>

	<h2>INFORMATION COLLECTED</h2>
	<p>
		In general, you can visit this Website without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web
		servers collect the domain names of visitors, and seek as many Websites do to place a "cookie" (a small data file) on
		your computer. This allows our servers to track statistical information about navigation to and throughout certain areas
		of our site, as well as to recognize your computer when it visits again. This cookie is not used to obtain your name or
		any personal data, and the information that is tracked is used for internal purposes only and is not shared with other
		companies. However, if you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your browser to reject them or to alert you before
		one is placed.
	</p><br><p>
		In addition, there are portions of this Website where we may need to collect personal information from you for a specific
		purpose, such as to provide you with the services you request. The information collected may include your name, contact
		information, financial information, and/or payment information.
	</p><br><p>
		This Website is not intended for persons under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal
		information from or about children, and we do not knowingly market our products or services to children.
	</p><br>

	<h2>USE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>We don't spam.</strong>
	</p><p>
		We will send you e-mail and/or postal mail as necessary to process your order or respond to your inquiry. On occasion,
		we may also send you information about services we provide which relate directly to information that you have submitted
		to us.
	</p><p>
		<strong>We don't sell data.</strong>
	</p><p>
		We will never sell or rent your data to anyone, for any purpose.
	</p><p>
		When you place an order on our Website, your data will only be seen by those entities necessary to process your
		requested order. And if we do need to present any data to another entity as part of processing your order, only the
		minimum necessary amount of data will be presented.
	</p><br><p>
		For example, for a FAFSA application filing, we would need to present portions of your information to two entities:
	</p><br><p>
		1. We would present your payment information to a payment processor to process the payment for the order.
		<br>2. We would present your FAFSA information to the US Department of Education to file the application as requested.
	</p><br><p>
		If you have any questions about this example, please contact us. We wish for it to be as clear as possible so that you're
		confident your data is being used only as you intended.
	</p><br><p>
		Certain statistical information is also collected from all visitors to the Website, such as the number of visits, average
		time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. That data is not used to personally identify you, but instead is aggregated to
		measure usage of the site and choose areas for improvement accordingly.
	</p><br>

	<h2>OPT-OUT</h2>
	<p>
		We allows users to opt-out of receiving future communications and/or to have information removed from our database.
		Simply submit your request via e-mail to <a href="mailto:fafsa@fafsa-application.com">fafsa@fafsa-application.com</a>. You may
		also submit your request by mail to Student Aid Application Services, LLC., 4741 Central St, Ste.142, Kansas City, MO 64112.
	</p><br>

	<h2>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h2>
	<p>
		This Website may contain links to other sites, where you may be able to access information and features offered by other
		parties. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for
		the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites.
	</p><br>

	<h2>SECURITY OF COLLECTED INFORMATION</h2>
	<p>
		We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable law and federal standards to
		protect your personal information from unauthorized or inappropriate access.
	</p><br>

	<h2>CONTACTING US</h2>
