   <p>When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, ZIP code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. When you register with the Site and  sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.</p>
   <p>inXile automatically receives and records from  cookies inXile may place on your computer non-Personally Identifiable Information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the pages you request.</p>
   <p>inXile uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with  promotions or sweepstakes, keep you informed about products and  services that may interest you, conduct research, and provide anonymous  reporting for internal and external clients.</p>
   <p><strong>Children</strong></p>
   <p>The Site is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from  children under 13 years of age beyond an e-mail address used only once for verification purposes. While children under the age of 13 can create/save designs, they are not permitted to post in the forums. We strongly encourage parents to review the Privacy Policies and Terms of Use of these other sites before allowing your children to view them. </p>
   <p>If you are a child under the age of 13, the email address we collect from you during the registration process will be deleted from our records immediately following the verification process, and we will not use the email address to contact you or share it with any third parties.</p>
   <p><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong></p>
   <p>inXile does not rent, sell, or share personal information collected from the Site about you with non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>
   <p>-We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with inXile under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help inXile communicate with you about offers from the Site and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.</p>

This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by inXile from the Site.</p>
   <p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong></p>
   <p>The Site may display targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria- for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.</p>
   <p>inXile does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the advertisement.</p>
   <p>Advertisements that appear on the Site are  sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party  advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this  happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to  your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web  beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of  their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the  advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you  an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and  to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile  information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw  their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked.  inXile does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be  placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no  access to your contact information stored on the Site unless you choose  to share it with them.</p>
   <p>This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by  inXile and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking  technologies by any of its advertisers.</p>
   <p>The Site's advertisers may include financial  service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and  mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores,  airlines, and software companies).</p>
   <p><strong>Changing or Removing Information</strong></p>
   <p>Access and control over most personal information  on the Site is readily available through the profile editing tools. You  may modify or delete any of your profile information at any time by  logging into your account. Information will be updated immediately.  Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable  period of time but will not be generally available to members of the  Site.</p>
   <p>Where you make use of the communication features  of the service to share information with other individuals on the Site,  however, (e.g., sending a personal message to another user on the Site)  you generally cannot remove such communications.</p>
