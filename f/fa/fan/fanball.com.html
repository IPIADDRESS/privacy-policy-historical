<p><b>Draft Kits</b> - Downloadable materials such as the NBA Draft Kit are non-refundable purchases. </p>

<p><b>Owners Edge (NFL &amp; MLB)</b> - 


</p><h3>Games</h3><br>
<p><b>Fanball Commissioner</b> - Game participants have a 2-week free trial use of the Commissioner product, after week #2 there are no refunds available.  Since the Live Draft is included with a Commissioner purchase if you request a refund for Commissioner and have used the Live Draft the Live Draft room price will be deducted from the amount of the refund.  </p>

<p><b>Exit 42</b> - Game participants are eligible for a refund if they have not drafted a team and the league draft is not currently in process.  Since users purchase Exit 42 teams in packages of 2, there are no partial refunds.  So if you use one team you cannot be refunded for the remaining unused team.  </p>

<p><b>Owners Edge</b> - Service users will be eligible for a refund within the first month after the product was purchased. All Owners Edge purchases will be refunded on a pro-rated basis. </p>

<p><b>Live Draft</b>  - Service users will be eligible for a refund only if product has not been used.  Once the Live Draft had been used there will be no refunds.  If Live Draft was purchased, as part of Commissioner and the Live Draft was not used, the Live Draft portion of the Commissioner purchase is non-refundable. </p>

<p><b>Superstar Cap Challenge</b> - Game participants are eligible for a refund only if they have not yet participated in a week's games.  Requests for refund must be received before the start of the week's games.  For example, if you purchase a team in a given week (Monday - Sunday) you would have until the start of that week's games to request and receive a refund. </p>

<p><b>Superstar Cap Challenge Transactions</b> - Game participants are eligible for a refund only if transactions were purchased and refunded in conjunction with a team and neither the team nor the transactions have been used.  There is no refund for transactions packages that are partially used or transactions that are unused that do not accompany a team refund.    </p>

<p><b>Playoff Hold'em</b> - Game participants are only eligible for a refund before the start of the playoffs.  Once the playoffs begin there will be no refunds. </p>

<p><b>Playoff Hold'em Transactions</b> - Game participants are eligible for a refund only if transactions were purchased and refunded in conjunction with a team and neither the team nor the transactions have been used.  There is no refund for transactions packages that are partially used or transactions that are unused that do not accompany a team refund.    </p>
