("FA") operates, and FantasyAlarm.com owns, the Internet Web site located at www.FantasyAlarm.com (the "FA Web Site" or the "Site"). FA has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share identifiable personal information ("INFO"-- your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number or credit card number) we obtain from users of our Site. This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by FA, including the FA Web site, the FA mobile services, and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by FA in connection with the FA Web site (collectively, the "Services").</span></span></p>

Your continued use of the Services after FA posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. If FA materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your INFO, your INFO will continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of and have not objected to the change.</p>
