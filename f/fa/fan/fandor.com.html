<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0.08in; line-height: 100%"><b>Our
Film Festival, Inc. (dba Fandor)<br>PRIVACY POLICY<br>Last Revised: June 28, 2010</b></p>
<p>This
privacy policy (“<b>Policy</b>”) explains how personal information is collected, used and disclosed by Our Film Festival, Inc. (dba Fandor) 
(“<b>Our Film Festival</b>”, “<b>we</b>” or “<b>us</b>”)
with respect to your use of the Web site located at <b>www.fandor.com</b> (the “<b>Site</b>”)
so you can make an informed decision about using the Site and the audiovisual works (from independent films to trailers to interviews) 
and other related services made available via the Site (collectively, the “<b>Services</b>”).</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any
time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on
the Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review
this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any
personal information you provide will be used. </p>

<p><b>What Is Personal Information?</b></p>
<p>For the purpose of this Policy, “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a
name, address, telephone number, mobile number or e-mail address) or information about that individual that is directly linked to
personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about
the use of the Site or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information
has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>

<p><b>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</b></p>
<p><u>Active Collection</u> – Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when
you visit the Site. We collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us, such as when you create an account and profile, send
us an email, order Services, pay for Services, provide or request information or post reviews/comments or other content on the Site.
Such information may include personal information, such as your name, user name, social network information, credit or debit card
information and demographic information).  Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such
information in connection with creating a profile, leaving comments, posting content, participating in any interactive forums or features
on the Site. In addition, from time-to-time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you provide in
connection with your participation in surveys, promotional offers, and other activities on the Site.</p>

<p><u>Passive Collection</u> – When you use the Site, some information is also automatically
collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring Web
site, and your activity on the Site. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the
identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.</p>

<p>We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of “cookies” or web beacons. Cookies are small data files stored on
your hard drive at the request of a Web site. Among other things, cookies help us improve the Site and your experience. If we link
cookies to any personally identifying information, we will treat this information as personal information. If you wish to block, erase, or
be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions. However, if you choose to remove or
reject cookies, this could affect certain features and/or the Services. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be
used on the Site or in emails relating to the Site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Site.</p>

<p>We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Site. These third parties may place cookies, web beacons or other devices on your
computer to collect non-personal information, and information provided by these devices may be used, among other things, to analyze
data, to determine the popularity of certain content, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests, and to better understand the
usage and visitation of the Site and the other Web sites tracked by these third parties. This policy does not apply to, and we are not
responsible for, cookies or web beacons in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad
services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology.</p>

<p>We may store and process personal information in the United States and other countries.</p>

<p><b>How Do We Use the Personal Information We Collect?</b></p>

	</li><li>when you give us your consent to do so, including if we notify you on the Site that the information you provide will be shared in a particular
	manner and you provide such information;

from the Site. We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with personal
information.</p>

<p><b>What Steps Do We Take To Protect Your Information Online?</b></p>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure,
alteration and destruction. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no
