<p>Oh wow, you're actually reading this? Wait a sec, let me turn on stuffy lawyer mode. Here goes:</p>

<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<div class="span-18">

  <p>Revised August 6, 2012</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how Our Film Festival, Inc. (“Fandor”) collects, uses, and discloses personal information in connection with Fandor’s social movie streaming service, including our software and streaming applications, our social discovery and sharing tools, and our collection of content, accessed via the Fandor site located at www.fandor.com, via Fandor applications on devices such as iPad or Roku, or via third-party sites such as Facebook (collectively, the “Service”). We provide this information so you can make an informed decision about using the Service and the audiovisual materials made available via the Service.</p>

  <p>We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.</p>

  <h2>What Is Personal Information?</h2>
  <p>“Personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address) or information about that individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, such as data about the use of the Service or about a group or category of users where individual identities are removed. This Policy does not restrict our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>

  <h2>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h2>
  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Active Collection.</span> We collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us, such as when you create an account or profile, send us an email, order services, pay for services, provide or request information, or post reviews, comments, or other content on the Service. The information we collect may include personal information, such as your name, user name, social network information, credit or debit card information, and demographic information. From time-to-time, we may collect personal information that you provide by participating in surveys, promotional offers, or other similar activities.</p>
  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Passive Collection.</span> When you use the Service, some information may also be automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, browser type, the address of a referring Web site, and your activity on the Service. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.</p>
  <p>We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of “cookies” or web beacons. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a Web site. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the site or in emails relating to the Service to collect certain information and monitor user activity. We use these tools to help us improve the Service and your experience. If we link cookies or beacon data to any personally identifying information, we will treat this information as personal information. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions. However, choosing to remove or reject cookies could affect or disable certain features of the Service. </p>
  <p>You may encounter ads served by third parties in your use of the Service. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, or other means to collect non-personal information, and may use information collected to, among other things, analyze data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising targeted to your interests, and better understand the usage and visitation of the Service and the other Web sites tracked by these third parties. This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or web beacons located in third-party ads. We encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology.</p>

  <h2>How Do We Use The Personal Information We Collect?</h2>
  <p>We use personal information collected through the Service for the purposes described in this Policy or elsewhere within the Service. For example, we may use personal information we collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>to provide the Service or information you request, and to process and complete any related transactions</li>
    <li>to request feedback from you or contact you about your use of the Service</li>
    <li>to respond to your emails, submissions, questions, comments, requests, complaints, or otherwise provide customer service;</li>
    <li>to monitor and analyze Service usage and trends, to personalize and improve the Service and your experiences with it, such as content or features that match your profile or interests, and to increase the Service’s functionality and ease of use</li>
    <li>to provide you with news and information about events, activities, offers, promotions, products, and services that may be of interest to you</li>
    <li>to send you confirmations, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages, and otherwise facilitate your use and enjoyment of the Service</li>
    <li>to notify you about important changes to the Service</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We may store and process personal information in the United States and other countries. By using the service, you consent to the transfer, processing, and use of your personal information in the United States.</p>

  <h2>What Personal Information Do We Share With Third Parties?</h2>
  <p>We will not share your personal information with others except as described in this Policy or within the Service and in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is reasonably necessary to offer the Service, legally required, or permitted by you. For example, we may use third parties to facilitate our business to host the Service at a co-location or cloud-based server facility, to authenticate and secure your account, to send out email updates about the Service, to process payments for the Service, or to provide links to related content. In connection with these business operations we may provide certain personal information to such service providers for limited time and purpose.</p>
  <p>Where we use third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technological protections that limit the use and access of that information to official Fandor-specified purposes. We do reserve the right to transfer your personal information to a successor in interest in the event of a corporate transaction that changes the ownership of Fandor or substantially all of its assets.</p>
  <p>You understand that when you use the Service, information you post in your profile, film reviews, and other interactive areas of the Service, as well as any information you share or permit us to share through the Service or via third-party services like Facebook or Twitter, will be available to other users and in some cases may be publicly available. We recommend you be cautious about giving out sensitive personal information to others or sharing personal information in public online forums.</p>
  <p>We are not responsible for the actions of third parties, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly or indirectly to any third parties. We encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices before disclosing personal information to any such parties. </p>

  <h2>Links To Other Web sites</h2>
  <p>The Site may contain links to other Web sites. Any personal information you provide on linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party’s privacy policy. This Policy does not apply to such linked web sites. Fandor is not responsible for the privacy and security practices and policies of any such site. We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with personal information.</p>

  <h2>What Steps Do We Take To Protect Your Information Online?</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against interception or other misuse. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your login information confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the Service by any person using your login information. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused.</p>

  <h2>What Choices Do You Have Regarding The Use Of Your Information?</h2>
  <p>You may opt out of receiving marketing or promotional emails from us by following the instructions in those emails. You may also opt out of such marketing emails by emailing us at <a href="mailto:marketing@fandor.com" rel="nofollow">marketing@fandor.com</a>. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your account or our ongoing business relations.</p>

  <h2>Questions?</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@fandor.com" rel="nofollow">support@fandor.com</a></p>
