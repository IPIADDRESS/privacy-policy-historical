          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>On the FanSnap Site, we do not require fans to register in order to perform searches or select tickets for purchase from the ticket providers whose results we display.  Fans who use our services are not required to provide us with any personal information, including their email address or credit card information.</p>
          <p>Fans may choose to register with us in order to take advantage of certain special features and services we offer.  We will collect names and email addresses from those fans and will use that information as we describe below.  In any event, FanSnap passes no personal information to the third-party ticket providers to which we transfer customers.</p>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>The following Privacy Policy summarizes the various ways in which FanSnap uses the information fans provide to us, or we gather from fans, while they use content, data, materials, information, products and services through this Web site (collectively, the “FanSnap Site”). It is our goal to provide fans with the most relevant results tailored to their individual interests, to make this process and fast and easy as possible, and at the same time, protect their privacy.</p>
          <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before accessing or using the FanSnap Site. If you access or use the FanSnap Site, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, then please do not use the FanSnap Site.</p>
          <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy only covers information fans provide to us or we gather from fans while they use the FanSnap Site. This Privacy Policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including, without limitation, on sites linked to through the FanSnap Site such as the Web sites maintained by third-party ticket providers who provide ticket data to, and make tickets available for sale through, the FanSnap Site or Web sites maintained by our advertisers.</p>
          <p>In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, please read our Terms of Use. Your use of the FanSnap Site constitutes agreement to the Terms of Use as well.</p>
          <h2>Amendment</h2>
          <p>We may make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time by posting such changes on the FanSnap Site. You understand and agree that if you use the FanSnap Site after the date on which we have changed the Privacy Policy, we will treat your use as acceptance of the Privacy Policy as changed.</p>
          <h2>What Information We Collect from You</h2>
          <p>We neither require nor collect any personal information from you, unless you decide to register with us.</p>
          <p>If you do decide to register with us, we will ask you for the basics including your name, email address and password and may allow you to provide us with other information including your team, artist, event and other search preferences.</p>
          <p>To help improve the quality of our search results, we collect certain non-personal information from all fans, not just those who have registered with us, including IP address, browser type, domain name, access times, duration of visit, referring URL, platform, new and repeat information, search history, click activity, time stamp and exit page information.</p>
          <p>If you contact us, we also will collect the information you provide that details the nature of your question or problem to enhance the quality of the FanSnap Site and our services.</p>
          <h2>What Organization Is Collecting the Information</h2>
          <p>FanSnap, Inc., a Delaware corporation, operates and manages the FanSnap Site, www.fansnap.com. More information about FanSnap<sup>sm</sup> may be found at About Us.</p>
          <h2>How Your Information Is Protected</h2>
          <p>We maintain data handling and storage practices and procedures that are designed to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of fans’ personal information. Current Internet security methods and technologies are used to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct use of information.</p>
          <h2>When and How We May Share Your Information</h2>
          <p>The information we gather may be used to customize your experience on the FanSnap Site and target content on the FanSnap Site to more closely match your interests. In addition, we may use the information we gather from you to send you marketing communications if you have elected to receive them.</p>
          <p>We also may share your personal information as follows:</p>
          <p>When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect or defend the rights, property, or safety of FanSnap, fans or others; and in connection with the enforcement of our Terms of Use.</p>
          <p>In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</p>
          <p>With business firms contracted to provide specific services to us, in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. In situations such as this where your data is shared with a third-party firm, the firm will be contractually obligated to use your personal data only for the purpose for which our relationship with the firm exists. The firm will not have the right to share your data with other organizations or contact you outside the bounds of this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>From time to time, we also may share statistical information about the FanSnap Site such as the number of visitors, aggregate demographic data or visitor behavior, search trends, and other non-personally identifiable with our advertisers, partners, or the press.</p>

          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>A cookie is a unique identifier sent to your computer by a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie lets a computer server identify your computer. A cookie is what allows many sites to greet you upon every return with a personalized message even before you actively login. We use cookies to help us provide you with better search results and to improve your experience on our site in other ways. Our cookies do not include any personal information, but they do help us track which of our Web pages are visited, which searches are performed and what services are most often used.

          <h2>Third-Party Ad Serving</h2>
          <p>From time to time, we may use third-party advertising companies to serve advertising on our behalf. Through the use of cookies and other technology devices commonly referred to as action tags (also known as Web Beacons or one-pixel .gif files), these third-party advertising companies can measure the effectiveness of our ads and also may receive specific information about your use of the FanSnap Site. The information gathered by these third-parties is anonymous and does not contain any personal information about individual fans.</p>
          <h2>Promotions</h2>
          <p>We may occasionally offer fans an opportunity to participate in a survey, contest or sweepstakes.

          <h2>Fan Testimonials</h2>
          <p>We often receive testimonials and comments from fans who have had positive experiences with the FanSnap<sup>sm</sup> Site and our services. We occasionally may publish such content. When we publish this content, we will identify fans by only their first names and also may indicate their home cities.</p>

          <p>Children are not eligible to use our services and we ask that minors (anyone under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18 or permit them to use the FanSnap Site.</p>
