            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>On the FanSnap Site, we do not require fans to register in order to perform searches or select tickets for purchase from the ticket providers whose results we display.  Fans who use our services are not required to provide us with any personal information, including their email address or credit card information.</p>
            <p>Fans may choose to register with us in order to take advantage of certain special features and services we offer.  We will collect names and email addresses from those fans and will use that information as we describe below.  In any event, FanSnap passes no personal information to the third-party ticket providers to which we transfer customers for their promotional use.</p>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The following Privacy Policy summarizes the various ways in which FanSnap uses the information fans provide to us, or we gather from fans, while they use content, data, materials, information, products and services through this Web site (collectively, the “FanSnap Site”). It is our goal to provide fans with the most relevant results tailored to their individual interests, to make this process as fast and easy as possible, and at the same time, protect fans' privacy.</p>
            <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before accessing or using the FanSnap Site. If you access or use the FanSnap Site, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, then please do not use the FanSnap Site.</p>
            <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy only covers information fans provide to us or we gather from fans while they use the FanSnap Site. This Privacy Policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including, without limitation, on sites linked to through the FanSnap Site such as the Web sites maintained by third-party ticket providers who provide ticket data to, and make tickets available for sale through, the FanSnap Site or Web sites maintained by our advertisers.</p>
            <p>In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, please read our Terms of Use. Your use of the FanSnap Site constitutes agreement to the Terms of Use as well.</p>
            <h2>Amendment</h2>
            <p>We may make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time by posting such changes on the FanSnap Site. If the changes that we make to the Privacy Policy are material, we will post notice of such changes on the home page of the FanSnap Site at least 30 days before the changes become effective. You understand and agree that if you use the FanSnap Site after the effective date of any changes to the Privacy Policy, we will treat your use as acceptance of the Privacy Policy as changed.</p>
            <h2>What Information We Collect from You</h2>
            <p>We neither require nor collect any personal information from you, unless you decide to register with us via our signup links located on the FanSnap Site.</p>
            <p>If you do decide to register with us, we will ask you for the basics including your name, email address and password and may allow you to provide us with other information including your team, artist, event and other search preferences.</p>
            <p>To help improve the quality of our search results, we collect certain non-personal information from all fans, not just those who have registered with us, including IP address, browser type, domain name, access times, duration of visit, referring URL, platform, new and repeat information, search history, click activity, time stamp and exit page information.</p>
            <p>If you contact us, we also will collect the information you provide that details the nature of your question or problem to enhance the quality of the FanSnap Site and our services.</p>
            <h2>What Organization Is Collecting the Information</h2>
            <p>FanSnap, Inc., a Delaware corporation, operates and manages the FanSnap Site, www.fansnap.com. More information about FanSnap may be found at the About FanSnap links located on the bottom of each page of the FanSnap Site.</p>
            <h2>How Your Information Is Protected</h2>
            <p>We maintain data handling and storage practices and procedures that are designed to ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of fans’ personal information. Current Internet security methods and technologies are used to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct use of information.</p>
            <h2>When and How We May Share Your Information</h2>
            <p>The information we gather may be used to customize your experience on the FanSnap Site and target content on the FanSnap Site to more closely match your interests. In addition, we may use the information we gather from you to send you marketing communications if you have elected to receive them.</p>
            <p>We also may share your personal information as follows:</p>
            <p>When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect or defend the rights, property, or safety of FanSnap, fans or others; in connection with the enforcement of our Terms of Use; and in compliance with warrants, subpoenas, court orders or legal proceedings.</p>
            <p>In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</p>
            <p>With business firms contracted to provide specific services to us, in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. In situations such as this where your data is shared with a third-party firm, the firm will be contractually obligated to use your personal data only for the purpose for which our relationship with the firm exists. The firm will not have the right to share your data with other organizations or contact you for their own promotional purposes outside the bounds of this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>From time to time, we also may share statistical information about the FanSnap Site such as the number of visitors, aggregate demographic data or visitor behavior, search trends, and other non-personally identifiable with our advertisers, partners or the press.</p>
            <p>Other than as set out above, you will be notified via email when your personal information will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information.</p>
            <h2>What Choices Are Available to You</h2>
            <p>Registration is optional. If you choose not to register, you will be able to conduct event ticket searches and use the primary features of the FanSnap Site but certain special features will not be available to you.</p>

            <p>With the exception of emails confirming registration, emails that include information about your account and emails relating directly to a purchase you have made from a third-party ticket provider to which you were transferred from the FanSnap Site, we will not send you any emails unless you opt in to receive communications from us. If you opt in to receive communications from us, you will receive information we believe will be of use and interest to you including, for example:</p>
