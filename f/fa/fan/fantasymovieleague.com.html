            <p>Welcome to Fantasy Movie League, a personal online service operated by Kinetoplay Inc. ("Kinetoplay") which consists of, among other things, software that you have downloaded or are about to download, any software that you have embedded on a web site or are about to embed (“Kinetoplay Games”), any applications created by Kinetoplay and available through social networking sites (“SNS Apps”) or web sites or on mobile platforms, any software running on Kinetoplay' servers, (“Kinetoplay Software”), content, related documentation, information on the Kinetoplay domains, and information made available by users to each other through the Kinetoplay Software (collectively, the “Service”).</p><br>
            
            <p>Your privacy is important to us and, as described in this Privacy Policy, we have designed the Service to protect information about you from unauthorized disclosure to others. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and, in certain circumstances, share your “Personally Identifying Information”. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us.</p><br>
            
            <p>By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy, as such policy may be amended from time to time. We may update the Privacy Policy and if we do, we will post a notice that changes have been made on the website www.fantasymovieleague.com. You should visit this page periodically to review any changes to the Privacy Policy.</p>
            
            <p><br>
            </p>
            
            <p><b>What We Collect</b></p>
            
            <p>Kinetoplay gives you a number of options regarding what information you will give us:</p><br>
            
            <p>When you submit your account information to Kinetoplay, your profile including any information (including your email address) will be registered with Kinetoplay. When you identify yourself on a Kinetoplay site, you may identify yourself through a social network account in which Kinetoplay may receive additional personal information about you.</p><br>
            
            <p>In each case, we will collect and record the information you have provided. Other than information provided at your discretion, we don't generally collect any Personally Identifying Information about our users (such as Social Security number, telephone number, driver license number, etc.), exceptions being for (1)billing and payments where we store your billing information such as name, street address, phone number; and (2)prizing where we may store your date of birth, street address and phone number to determine eligibility for and fulfill prizes. We may offer you the opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such as gender, age, occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.), or we may be able to collect that information from social networking systems on which you have used Kinetoplay Games or SNS Apps (in accordance with the terms of use of those systems), which would then also be covered by this Privacy Policy.</p><br>
            
            <p>You may choose to share information about yourself in other content ("Content"), such as in games. (The example of “games”, here, is not intended to be a complete list of other ways in which you may come to share information about yourself.) Any action you perform or information about yourself that you share with other players is considered public, and at your own discretion.</p><br>
            
            <p>When you use an SNS App on your social network page or use an SNS App on someone else's page, we may record information regarding the use of that SNS App, and we may collect other information that is visible on your social network page in accordance with the relevant terms of use associated with that page.</p><br>
            
            <p>Note that since Kinetoplay Software may be served through SNS Apps, it is your responsibility to read and accept their Terms of Use, as well as Privacy Policy prior to continuing, as you will be subject to such Terms of Use and Privacy Policy of such Apps.</p><br>
            
            <p>When you invite new members into your network or send messages through the Service, we may collect and maintain on secure servers the information associated with those messages, including email addresses and content.</p><br>
            
            <p>We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, Kinetoplay Games and other users of Kinetoplay, to supplement your profile.</p><br>
            
            <p>Kinetoplay may contain links to other web sites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects Personally Identifying Information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Kinetoplay.</p><br>
            
            <p>You should also be aware that some content delivered through Kinetoplay Games originates with another content provider. Such other content providers may place “cookies” on your browser, or otherwise gather information about you, including by asking you to provide information through the site itself.</p><br>
            
            <p>Finally, in order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain internal reports and make recommendations, we collect aggregate information about the use of the Service, including information about users accessing the Kinetoplay site or playing Kinetoplay Games or using SNS Apps on other sites, such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time (collectively, “Activity Information”).</p><br>
            
            <p>By using the Service, you consent to our retaining all the above-described information as long as Kinetoplay sees fit.</p>
            
            <p><br>
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Children Under The Age Of 13</b></p>
            
            <p>Kinetoplay does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifying Information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for Kinetoplay or send any information about yourself to us, including but not limited to your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any Personally Identifying Information to or on Kinetoplay. In the event that we learn that we have collected Personally Identifying Information from a child under age 13 we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at admin@fantasymovieleague.com .</p>
            
            <p><br>
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Children Between The Ages of 13 and 18</b></p>
            
            <p>We recommend that minors over the age of 13 and under the age of 18 (19 if a resident of AL or NE) ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>
            
            <p><br>
            </p>
            
            <p><b>How We Use Your Information</b></p>
            
            <p>We do not sell or rent your Personally Identifying Information to any third party. We may, however, use certain Personally Identifying Information (as provided herein) and/or certain information about you that is not personally identifiable (as provided herein).</p><br>
            
            <p>We may, for example, use this information to assist advertisers in targeting their advertising.</p><br>
            
            <p>We also use your name, email address and other information on our system to notify you of new product releases, service notifications, and to solicit your feedback and input. Those emails will contain links for preference management and where appropriate, unsubscribe links should you decide you do not want to receive further emails.</p><br>
            
            <p>You understand and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose any information we may have about you and the contents of your account if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to protect our rights and property, or that of our affiliates or the public. Kinetoplay is not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar governmental request that Kinetoplay receives.</p><br>
            
            <p>Kinetoplay may maintain copies of your Content indefinitely, or delete certain Content in whole or in part if Kinetoplay determines, in its sole discretion, that such Content constitutes a violation of the “Usage Rules” as defined in the company’s “Terms of Service”.</p><br>
            
            <p>We also use non-Personally Identifying Information and certain technical information about your computer and your access of the Service (including your internet protocol address) in order to operate, maintain and manage the Service.</p><br>
            
            <p>Kinetoplay may disclose Personally Identifying Information about you to its partners in order to provide the Service, resolve service problems and correct errors in the Service, to communicate with you about the Service, to provide you with advertising and promotional information in connection with the Service, to determine eligibility for and fulfillment of prizes, and to enhance your experience on the Service. However, we do not give our partners an independent right to share this information or use it for any purposes except those we authorize in accordance with the foregoing or detail specifically within the Official Rules of a prizing contest.</p><br>
            
            <p>Kinetoplay, certain of its partners, and each of their contractors and employees may view the Content that you transmit to the service to provide the Service and otherwise perform the authorized tasks set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            
            <p><br>
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Controlling Your Personally Identifying Information</b></p>
            
            <p>Be advised that if you send messages or post material containing Personally Identifying Information through the Service, that information may be collected and used by others.</p><br>
            
            <p>You can terminate your account at any time which will remove your profile and Personally Identifying Information from view subject to the following: Kinetoplay may (but is not obligated to) keep information about you that is on its system following your termination so we could, for example, contact you should you win a prize after the termination of your account or display your results on a leaderboard. Please contact Kinetoplay to terminate your account or for any other questions about your Personally Identifying Information.</p>
            
            <p><br>
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Transfer of Information</b></p>
            
            <p>We reserve the right to transfer your Personally Identifying Information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Kinetoplay or the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Kinetoplay related to the business which collected such information, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, Kinetoplay will notify users who have provided email addresses when information about those users is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
            
            <p><br>
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Others' Information</b></p>
            
            <p>You may decide to provide us with another person's email address so that person may be invited to join Kinetoplay or so that we may facilitate your communication with other people through the Service (such as when you upload an address book).</p><br>
            
            <p>You may also provide us with another person's contact information for purposes of delivering information through SNS Apps. We use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person that he or she has been invited to join Kinetoplay or received content through an SNS App. All invitees are provided with the option not to receive further invitations from Kinetoplay. We may disclose such information if required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as described above.</p>
            
            <p><br>
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Cookies</b></p>

            <p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our sites and on certain Kinetoplay Games and SNS Apps. Our system and the third-party advertising technology uses information derived from Activity Information, Kinetoplay’ cookies on your hard drive, your visits to our site(s), the Kinetoplay Games that you view and the SNS Apps you use to target advertising within our site or Kinetoplay Games or SNS Apps. In addition, our advertisers may use other third-party advertising technology to target advertising on our site and other sites. In the course of advertisements being served to you, a unique third-party cookie or cookies may be placed on your computer. Similarly, third-party advertising companies may provide us with pixel tags (also called “clear gifs” or “beacons”) to help manage and optimize our online advertising. Beacons enable us to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits the site on which the beacon is located, and to learn which banner ads bring users to a given site.</p><br>
            
            <p>Kinetoplay does not provide any Personally Identifying Information to third-party advertising companies. Note, however, that if an advertiser asks Kinetoplay to show an advertisement to users with certain characteristics (for example, women ages 18-24) or a segment of that group (for example, women ages 18-24 who have viewed certain categories of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the third-party advertising company may conclude that you have the characteristics of the audience that they are trying to reach.</p>
