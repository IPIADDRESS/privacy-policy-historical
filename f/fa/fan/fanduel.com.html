    <h3>6. Third Party Advertising And Analytics</h3>
    <p><u>6.1</u> Certain ads appearing on our Service are delivered by our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may use cookies and other similar technologies, often in conjunction with unique (anonymous) cookie identifiers, to collect data about your activities and interests, including the technologies described above. Some of these partners may use mobile device identifiers, such as Apple IDFAs and Google/Android Advertising IDs.  Doing this allows the ad companies to recognize your computer or device each time they send you an online or mobile advertisement. In this way, the ad companies may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer or device, saw their advertisements and measure your interaction with each ad. This information allows ad companies to deliver targeted advertisements that may be of increased interest to you, both on our Service and elsewhere online. Just as these technologies may be used to target ads on our websites and apps, we, or our advertising partners, may use these same technologies and data points (e.g., mobile identifiers, cookie identifiers, location-based data), through our Service or through other services, to target advertising (for ourselves or other companies) on other sites or mobile apps.  Sometimes, these identifiers may be derived from a hashed or encrypted version of personal information such as your email address. We may use this information to measure the performance of our advertising as well, for instance, to evaluate which ads or content our users prefer, or which are most effective.   In addition, sometimes we or an advertising partner may tailor advertising to you across different devices.</p>

    <p><u>6.2</u> To learn more and to opt out of the collection of data on our website by third parties (including those described above) for interest-based advertising purposes, please visit <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> or <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com">www.youronlinechoices.com</a>.
