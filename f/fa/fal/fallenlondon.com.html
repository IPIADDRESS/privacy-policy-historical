<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; This privacy policy sets out the basis on which we will process any personal information as well certain other information we collect from you, or that you provide to us. &nbsp;Please read this privacy policy carefully so that you understand how we will treat your information.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>A quick word about children</strong></p>
<p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; We recognise we have a special obligation to protect personal information we obtain from children. &nbsp;We do not and will not knowingly collect information from any unsupervised child under the age of 13. &nbsp;In certain countries, prior written permission or other verifiable consent may also be required from a parent or guardian for children under the age of 18.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
