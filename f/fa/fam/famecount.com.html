We have prepared this Privacy Statement to describe how we use data about you when you use our services.</p><h3>1. Who are we?</h3><p>1.1. We are Starcount Insights Ltd. (trading as Starcount). Our registered office is Henry Wood House, 2 Riding House Street, London, W1W 7FA, UK. Our company number is 08004810 and our VAT number is 141 0329 61.</p><p>1.2. Starcount provides data-driven "Services" to businesses &amp; organisations ("Clients"), and to general consumers ("Users"); we source data from social media networks, from our Clients and from other reputable data providers. Our Services are delivered through a variety of mechanisms,    including:</p><span class="strong">"Business Services"</span><ul><li>an online insight portal, "The Observatory"</li><li>a variety of insight reports. </li><li>a website (www.starcount.com)</li></ul><span class="strong">"Consumer Services"</span><ul><li>a range of consumer mobile apps that enable general consumers ("Users") to keep up to date with their favourite celebrities and brands across various Social Media Networks. </li></ul><h3>2. General</h3><p>2.1. This Privacy Policy explains how Starcount collects, uses, discloses and processes your personal data. By visiting the Starcount website or applications, authenticating with us or registering with us, or otherwise being provided with the opportunity to view this Privacy Policy, you accept and consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p><p>2.2. This Privacy Statement applies to all of the data that we collect through our Services, regardless of the type of Service or the device on which you access the Services.</p><p>2.3. From time to time, we may update this Privacy Statement to clarify or amend our privacy policies; if we make a material change to this Privacy Statement, we will notify you either by email or by notice on or through the Services you use. By continuing to use any of our Services, this will be treated as your acceptance of the updated Privacy Statement.</p><h3>3. Collection</h3><p>The personal data we collect about you depends on which Starcount Services you use.</p><p>3.1. <strong>Business Services</strong></p><p>3.1.1. If you register for any of our Client Services, we may ask you to provide your name, an email address, a contact telephone number, the company you work for, your address, a username and password and other information relevant to the Services we provide. For specific Starcount Services, the administrator for your Client account may provide this information on your behalf. From time to time, we may also collect other information directly from you.</p><p>3.1.2. Depending on which of our Services you register for, we may collect payment information from you to enable us to take payment for the Services you require.</p><p>3.1.3. We collect information about you when you use any of our Services. For example, if you are logged in to The Observatory, we will collect information as to how you use it, including: how often you log in, what parts of the portal you visit (and how often), what filters &amp; functions are commonly used. </p><p>3.1.4. We collect information about the device you use to use to connect to our Services, including web browser type, device type, operating system, your mobile device identifier, and the name of your ISP or mobile carrier. If permitted by your device, we may also collect your location information.</p><p>3.1.5. Based on the information you have provided or made available to us, we may infer other information to allow us to improve our service to you. This may include customising your experience of our Services or to suggest other Starcount Services you may be interested in trying.</p><p>3.1.6. As we constantly improve and expand our services, we may require the collection of new information from you. Whenever this occurs, this Privacy Policy will be updated. </p><p>3.2. <strong>Consumer Services</strong></p><p>3.2.1. For certain Starcount Services, you may be asked to authenticate using a Social Login process. Social Login (also known as social sign-in), is a form of single sign-on using existing information from a social networking service (such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram), to sign into a third party website or application instead of creating a new login account specifically for that website or application.</p><p>3.2.2. By authenticating to Starcount Services using Social Login, you consent to Starcount accessing information from the social media network that you authenticated yourself with.  This is in accordance with the terms and conditions you will have agreed to when registering with the relevant Social Media Network.</p><p>3.2.3. The data we collect (or infer) can include the name or username connected with your Social Media profile, the people you follow or engage with, your profile picture, your interests, your gender, your location, the content you publish, or any other data you make publicly available through your Social Media profile; this information is collected from the Social Media Network, processed and then stored by Starcount.</p><p>3.2.4. All of the Social Media data we collect is publicly available and could be sourced by anybody with a computer and access to the internet. </p><p>3.2.5. Through the use of our Consumer Services, we may also collect information about the device you use to use to connect to our Services, including web browser type, device type, operating system, your mobile device identifier, and the name of your ISP or mobile carrier. If permitted by your device, we may also collect your location information.</p><p>3.2.6. Your consent to our use of your publicly available data from the Social Networks is based on your privacy settings on the Social Networks themselves. If you do not wish for your data to appear on services like ours, we would recommend that you change the privacy settings on your Social Network account (for example, on Twitter, mark your account as "Protected").</p><h3>4. Using Your Information</h3><p>4.1. <strong>Business Services</strong></p><p>4.1.1. General user information may be used in the following ways:</p><ul><li>To ensure that content within our Services is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.</li><li>To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you.

Our Clients may also use our insight to provide relevant, targeted messages to consumers directly through social media (as per the terms and conditions of the Social Media Networks).</p><p>4.2.3. This data may also be aggregated and shared in our web applications at www.starcount.com, in The Observatory, on our mobile and other applications and in any reports we produce on third party sites, publications and applications, and in any B2B applications and products, operated by us or our Partners or licensees.</p><p>4.2.4. As a User of our Consumer Services, we, or our Partners, may contact you only where you have shared your data with us (either directly or through authenticating with one or more Social Networks). We may contact you, for example, to:</p><send>you information relating to our products or, where you have consented, our Partners’ products;</send><ul><li>Invite you to take part in competitions and contests;</li><li>Send you information related to your activities in our applications;</li><li>Inform you of and invite you to take advantage of offers, rewards and privileges;</li><li>Inform you of other products, which we think may be of interest to you (in the case of third party products, where you have opted in to receiving such information)</li></ul><p>4.2.5. You may always opt out of such communications by following the instructions on those messages or (where the contact is through a Social Network) through revoking your connection with our applications.</p><h3>5. Disclosure of your information</h3><p>5.1. In connection with the uses made of information, above, we may disclose or transfer your personal information to any member of our company, or related holding company/subsidiaries. These may be located outside the EEA in jurisdictions which do not have equivalent data protection laws to those in your jurisdiction.</p><p>5.2. We may also disclose or transfer your personal information to third parties for the following purposes:</p><ul><li>In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.</li><li>If our Site is acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.</li><li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal or business obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreement.</li></ul><h3>6. Accuracy, Retention &amp; Security</h3><p>6.1. We will retain personal information about you for as long as is reasonably necessary for us to provide our Services.</p><p>6.2. Unless a derogation applies, we will comply with requests to access or correct your personal data. We will also ensure personal data is accurate and complete. Where reasonably requested, we will also cease to retain personal data or remove the means by which personal data can be associated with individuals.</p><p>6.3. To exercise these rights, please email us at team@starcount.com or write to us at the address listed at the beginning of this document.</p><h3>7. External Links</h3><p>Our Services may, from time to time, contain links to and from websites of our Partners, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.
