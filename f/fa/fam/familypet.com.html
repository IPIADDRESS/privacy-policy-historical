            <p>Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”). This Privacy Policy applies to the use of the Sites (as defined below), including by both consumers and pet care professionals (pet care professionals including, without limitation, dog walkers , pet sitters, groomers, pet movers, pet insurance companies, boarding companies, pet medication companies and other non-consumer service professionals, are referred to as “Professionals”). Professionals, consumers and other persons using the Sites are individually and collectively referred to as “you”, and DICE SOLUTIONS LLC dba FamilyPet and its subsidiaries and affiliates are referred to as, “DICE”, “we”, “us” and “our”. We use the Sites to provide you with information, resources, tools, products and services specific to the pet care industry and related markets, and to provide you with information about us and our advertisers, and our respective products and services.   In conjunction with this Privacy Policy, you should also review our Terms of Use for a complete understanding of the rules governing our Sites.</p>
<p>What information is collected from me? Information You Give Us: Information collected from you will vary, depending on how you use the Site and what information you may choose to provide to us (whether through email or otherwise). It’s possible to browse most sections of the Site without submitting any personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information (“Personal information”) means individually identifiable information about you that we collect online, including but not limited to, your full name, email address, phone number, physical address. Whenever we ask for personal information, we strive to provide a link to this Privacy Policy to help you understand how your personal information will be used before you decide whether to disclose it. You can choose not to provide us with personal information, but then you may not be able to fully take advantage of certain features of our site and we may not be able to provide you with certain requested information, products and/or services.</p>
<p>Information Sharing Disclosure – How is my information used and shared? The use of your information depends on the context in which it is collected. Therefore, pay special attention to the categories below that relate to the features of the Sites that you wish to utilize.</p>
<p>Personal information: We may share the Personal information we collect from you only with your consent or under the following circumstances: User-Requested Services, Information or subscription to newsletters: Certain products or services on our Sites may seek Personal information from you, which may be used in the following ways:<br>
• For products and services provided by the Sites, the information you submit is used by us to provide the information, product or service you’ve requested. We may also share this information with others, but only to the extent necessary to fulfill your request or to facilitate your use of their services. • We may use other companies and individuals to perform supporting functions for the various tools, functionality and services offered through our site on our behalf. These service providers will not be permitted to use the information collected from you for any other purpose other than performing the support functions for DICE.  • For products and services offered to you jointly by us and a third party, your personal information may be shared with or independently gathered by the third party. In these situations, DICE will only use your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy, but the third party may use the information in different ways. Be aware that each company we do business with has its own policies regarding the use and protection of your information that may differ from those outlined in this Privacy Policy.<br>
Referrals: If you participate in any referral service we may offer:<br>
• Consumers: We use the information you submit to determine which of our participating professional(s) may be able to serve your needs. We may then forward your information, which may include Personal information, contained on our sign-up form to certain professional(s), who may then contact you. • Professionals: You may receive information from consumers seeking your products or services, including, without limitation, their Personal information. You may only use the information sent to you via our Sites for the purposes of providing products and/or services to the consumer. We require that you otherwise not share, use or transmit this information to or with any third party without the consumer’s consent.<br>
Protection of rights: We will release Personal information if we believe that such action is appropriate to: (1) comply with a legal process, warrant, subpoena or court order (2) enforce the Terms of Use Agreement for the applicable Site, or (3) identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities who are or we believe will cause injury to us or a third party, or (4) otherwise protect the rights, property or personal safety of DICE, its employees, Site users or others.<br>

The data you give us about your personal preferences and demographics (e.g., Address, ZIP code or the like) may be used to help us offer content, advertisements, products, and services that we believe will be of interest to you. In addition, we may share this information, in aggregate form, with our current and potential advertisers so that they can present advertisements more effectively.</p>
<p>Unless you specify that you’d prefer not to hear from us, we may use the email address you provide to contact you for promotional or other purposes. You may have these communications terminated at any time by opting out by clicking on any “unsubscribe” link contained in a promotional email. If you would like to request to opt out with respect to all of the Sites please email Privacy@petsitting.com with your requests.  • Professionals. Personal information provided to us from your trade association is not shared with third parties, unless you authorize it directly. Additionally, information provided by you for the purposes of offering your products and services to others via one or more of the Sites will be shared with others, including consumers accessing one or more of the Sites. To the extent such information is necessary to offer such products and services it will be posted on the applicable Site(s). This may include, without limitation, your full name, email address, address, phone number, graphic images and any other data intended to help consumers identify or contact you and for your products and services.<br>
Non-personal information: Children’s Privacy: Our Site is a general audience Web site. If you are under the age of 13 you should not provide information on our Site.

This Privacy Policy only applies to the Site, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content for any linked Web sites. You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other Web sites or contact the respective Webmasters of those Web sites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies.</p>
<p>Cookies: A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
<p>Security: We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br>

If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at privacy@dicesolutions.com.&nbsp; We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<p>Effective Date and Modifications: This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date first written above and may be updated and modified from time to time by us in our sole discretion. If we choose to update or modify this Privacy Policy, such updated or modified policy shall become effective five (5) business days after its posting on the applicable Site(s). Accordingly, we encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy and the Sites in order to keep apprised of our current privacy practices. If you do not agree to any provision of this Privacy Policy, or any update or modification thereto, please do not use the Sites.</p>
