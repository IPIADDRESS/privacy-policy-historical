        Legal Issues - Privacy Policy and Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>
        Family Tree DNA follows stringent policies for protecting your privacy according
        to state legislation guidelines. We control the Surname Database Library and genetic
        testing scores. Family Tree DNA only shares limited information with testing facilities.
        Both the University of Arizona testing lab and our Genomics Research Center follow
        strict guidelines to ensure your privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY STATEMENT below, Family Tree DNA
        also adheres to the following <a href="/pdf-docs/FTDNA-Safe-Harbor-Standards-07-2012.pdf">
            SAFE HARBOR PRIVACY STATEMENT</a> in connection with the transfer and protection
        of "personal information" received from the European Union (EU) or Switzerland.
    </p>
    <p>
        In compliance with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, Family Tree DNA
        commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your
        personal information. European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints
        regarding this privacy policy should first contact Family Tree DNA using our online
        Feedback form linked from the menu bar at the top of any of our pages at www.familytreedna.com</p>
    <p>
        Family Tree DNA has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under
        the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution
        mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
        If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint
        is not satisfactorily addressed by Family Tree DNA, please visit the BBB EU SAFE
        HARBOR web site at www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints for more information and
        to file a complaint.</p>
    <p>
        Family Tree DNA accepts the responsibility to keep your specific data private, at
        the same time, making enough general information public to allow us to build a Surname
        Database library usable for genealogical purposes.</p>
    <h3>
        To accomplish this Family Tree DNA allows you to do the following:</h3>
    <p>
        You may search the existing Surname Database Library to see if the surname you are
        searching is already there. If it is, you may order your DNA test kit and return
        to search to see that the database has increased under your surname. If the name
        you want to search is not there, you may order your test kit and then return to
        the database to see your surname registered. When you place your order, the order
        form will ask you to enter the surname for the direct paternal line.</p>
    <h1 class="seperatorBottom">
        Privacy and Confidentiality Statement</h1>
    <p>
        Your unique test kit number will accompany your collection tube to the testing lab.
        The computer-generated number and your surname is the only information about you
        that the testing facility will see. Once the lab completes your DNA test, Family
        Tree DNA enters the test results in a secure database. We then perform a comparison
        between your specific genetic results and those of others in the database.</p>
    <p>
        If the matching program finds a genetic match between you and another person in
        the database and you have each signed the <a href="/forms/FTDNA-release-form.pdf" target="_new">release form</a> Family Tree DNA will notify you via e-mail.</p>
    <p>
        If a genetic match is found between you and another individual who enters the library
        at some time in the future, both will be given the information that a potential
        match is in the database provided that BOTH of you have signed the <a href="/forms/FTDNA-release-form.pdf" target="_new">release form</a>. Only where both parties have signed the release
        form will we release contact information concerning the separate parties to the
        other party. In this way, all persons in the database will have the right to decide
        if they want to contact their genetic match(es).
    </p>
    <p>
        Family Tree DNA maintains strict privacy and confidentiality.
    </p>
    <h1 class="seperatorBottom">
        Project Participation</h1>
    <p>
        Family Tree DNA provides the option to participate in one or more projects. This
        may help you learn more by working with others who may share similar ancestry. If
        you choose to participate in a project, the project administrator will be able to
        view your results and contact information so that he or she may best help members
        of the project learn about their ancestry.
    </p>
    <p>
        So that members can share information more easily, projects often have a public
        website displaying member results. The free website that Family Tree DNA provides
        to projects lists member results by kit number. Results tables and maps on the free
        public website may include a participant’s oldest known ancestor, the ancestor’s
        country of origin, surname, and full name.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may join or leave projects at any time at no charge. <a href="http://www.familytreedna.com/projects.aspx">
            You can view a list of projects here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is important to note that while Family Tree DNA does not impose a limit to the
        number of projects one can join, we will not tolerate customers joining multiple
        projects with the purpose of data mining or finding information that is not relevant
        to one's personal ancestral origins. Family Tree DNA reserves the right to remove
        people from projects at our sole discretion or if it feels that a participant is
        abusing the system in a way that may infringe another participant's privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mtDNA full sequence test contains some genes in the coding region (CR). By default,
        these results are unavailable to the project administrators. You may choose to allow
        your project administrators to view your coding region results on the My Account
        – Results Display Settings page of your myFTDNA Account (personal page).
    </p>

                into consideration. This is because for most STR markers, each step difference is
                as meaningful as mismatches on additional markers.</p>

    <h2>
        Purposes of this Document</h2>
    <p>
        This document is intended to explain how Gene by Gene manages the privacy of your
        personal data and other information that can be used to identify you, either alone
        or in combination with other information, including your DNA samples and test results
        (collectively, “Personal Information”).
    </p>
    <p>
        We use your Personal Information to provide you with Gene by Gene services, customized
        reports and features. Customers of the different services provided by Gene by Gene
        are offered an opportunity to sign a Consent Form specific to each service which
        allows them to take full advantage of the services. In the absence of a specific
        Consent Form, this Privacy Document will prevail.</p>
    <p>
        By using the Gene by Gene websites and the services offered, you consent to the
        collection, use, storage and disclosure of your Personal Information by Gene by
        Gene in accordance with this Privacy Document. It should be read in conjunction
        with the Gene by Gene Terms of Use and Gene by Gene Consent Agreement.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Our Commitment to You</h2>
    <p>
        Gene by Gene collects, processes, stores and shares your Personal Information in
        a responsible, transparent and secure environment that fosters our customers’ trust
        and confidence. To that end, Gene by Gene respects your privacy and will not sell
        or rent your Personal Information without your consent.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please read this Gene by Gene Privacy Document and the relevant website FAQs or
        corresponding section for additional details.</p>
    <h2>
        Storage and Processing</h2>
    <p>
        When you provide us with any Personal Information, that Personal Information will
        be stored and processed at the Company’s Genomics Research Center in Houston, Texas.
        In the event that you are located outside the USA and still choose to order a DNA
        Test kit and provide a DNA sample, by providing us with Personal Information, you
        specifically consent to the transfer, storage and processing of Personal Information
        to and in the United States, which you recognize may provide a different level of
        protection for Personal Information and personal data than in your country of residence.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Security
    </h2>
    <p>
        Gene by Gene places great importance on the security of all of our customers’ Personal
        Information. We have reasonable and adequate security measures in place to attempt
        to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of customer data under our control.
        For example, our security and privacy practices are periodically reviewed and enhanced
        as necessary and only authorized personnel have access to Personal Information.
        We use secure server software to encrypt financial information you input before
        it is sent to us and we only work with laboratories and third parties who have met
        and commit to our security standard. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse
        or alteration of data will not occur, we use commercially reasonable efforts to
        prevent this.</p>
    <h2>
        Use and Disclosure of Personal Information
    </h2>
    <p>
        When you order an individual test online we primarily use your Personal Information
        to provide your test results, to verify and carry out financial transactions relating
        to payments you make online and to communicate with you.</p>
    <p>
        Gene by Gene discloses your Personal Information to third parties in very limited
        circumstances as set out below.</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
        <li>To third party service providers, under the protection of appropriate agreements,
            so that the third parties may perform various tasks for us. For example, we use
            third parties to process payments from you. These third parties are only given access
            to that information needed to perform their services, and are prohibited from using
            it for other purposes. Processors may include affiliated and unaffiliated service
            providers in the United States, Europe and in other jurisdictions.</li>
        <li>To the different Gene by Gene divisions, so that they may use Personal Information
            for the purposes described in this Privacy Document. Additionally, we might restructure,
            buy, or sell business units. In these transactions, customer information is often
            one of the transferred assets, remaining subject to promises made in then prevailing
            Privacy Documents. Also, in the event that Gene by Gene, or substantially all of
            its assets or stock, are acquired, transferred, disposed of (in whole or part and
            including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), Personal Information
            including test results will as a matter of course be one of the transferred assets;</li>
        <li>We may disclose your Personal Information
            <ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
                <li>with your knowledge and any relevant permissions; </li>
                <li>as described in this Privacy Document; </li>
                <li>as may be required by law, regulatory authorities, legal process or to protect the
                    rights or property of Gene by Gene or other Users (including outside your country
                    of residence); </li>
                <li>to enforce our terms and conditions; </li>
                <li>to protect our rights, privacy, safety, confidentiality, reputation or property,
                    and/or that of Gene by Gene, you or others; </li>
                <li>to prevent fraud or cybercrime; and </li>
                <li>to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Non-Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        When you visit our Gene by Gene website, we may automatically collect non-personal
        information about you, such as the website from which you have come to our Gene
        by Gene Website, your Media Access Control address, your computer type, screen resolution,
        Operating System version and Internet browser. We may also collect non-personal
        information such as demographic data, for example your geographic area. Non-personal
        information also includes personal information that has been aggregated in a manner
        such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of
        the Gene by Gene Website.</p>
    <h2>
        Additional Consent
    </h2>
    <p>
        Your use of any of Gene by Gene's services constitutes your consent to Gene
        by Gene allowing us to use your Personal Information for purposes of quality control
        and internal research and development activities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, your consent will be sought for research purposes. Much of the genetic
        information resulting from DNA testing has not been clinically validated, and the
        technology we use, which is the same technology used by the research community,
        to date has not been widely used for clinical testing. For these reasons, our customers
        are encouraged to participate in Gene by Gene's research initiatives that may
        contribute to a better understanding of the results of genetic testing. Your participation
        in these initiatives is entirely voluntary and your DNA test results will not be
        used or disclosed without your consent. Once given, however, consent cannot be revoked.</p>
    <p>
        We will ask for your consent in several ways. For example:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>A general consent document will be offered to you as part of your decision to participate
            in any of the Gene by Gene services offered by any of the websites owned and operated
            by Gene by Gene. Your consent will allow Gene By Gene to share your test results,
            anonymized and aggregated with those of others who have consented, with our third-party
            research partners for the purposes of general scientific research intended to lead
            to publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals.</li>
        <li>From time to time, we may ask for explicit consent to participate in specific research,
            and upon this consent we may allow our research partners to access your individual
            test results, which will be kept anonymous, for the purposes of general scientific
            research intended to lead to publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.
        </li>
        <li>From time to time, we may ask for explicit consent to participate in specific research,
            and upon this consent we may allow our research partners to access your individual
            test results, which will be kept anonymous, for the purposes of scientific research
            aimed at advancing genetic knowledge and creating, commercializing, or undertaking
            activities toward the practical applications that may lead to the improvement of
            health care.</li>
        <li>From time to time, we may ask for explicit consent to allow our research partners
            to access your non-anonymized individual test results in connection with a specific
            research project.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Research partners may include commercial or non-profit organizations that conduct
        or support population genetic studies, scientific/medical research, or the development
        of drugs or devices to diagnose, predict, or treat health conditions.</p>
    <h2>
        Changes
    </h2>
    <p>
        Gene by Gene may make changes to this Privacy Document from time to time. If we
        do so, we will issue an updated version of this Privacy Document with an updated
        date on the Gene by Gene Website (and/or notify you via e-mail or by other appropriate
        means) so that you will be aware of what information we collect, how we use it and
        under what circumstances we disclose it in accordance with applicable law. If you
        do not consent to any changes to our Privacy Document, you may notify us at (insert
        contact information). At Gene by Gene’s option on a case-by-case basis, we will
        either continue to apply the previous Privacy Document or delete your information
        and/or account.</p>
    <h2>
        Questions</h2>

            We encourage you to search for a family surname in our SURNAMES DATABASE. Our database
            contains family names of clients who have already ordered a DNA profile from Family
            Tree DNA.</p>
        <p>
            After you have searched for the surname that interests you, the name will appear
            in the result screen with a number after the name, e.g. Bowling (62). This indicates
            that the name Bowling is in our database and that 62 people with that surname (or
            a derivative) have already ordered a DNA sample tested. It is possible that not
            all 62 Bowlings have been added yet to our Recent Ancestral Origins (RAO) Database
            as we may be awaiting the analysis from the Lab for some of them.</p>
        <p>
            A link will be provided for you to order a genetic test below the result screen.
            If the surname you desire is not located in our database, you will receive a message
            entitled "Name not found," and a form will be provided below the message to enable
            you to order a test kit for that surname.</p>
        <p>
            Posting and updating to our database is instant. After you have registered your
            surname, you can search again to find the name in the updated database. Happy relative
            hunting!</p>
