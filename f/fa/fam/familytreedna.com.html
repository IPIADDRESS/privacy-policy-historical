            <h2>Purposes of this Document</h2>
            <p>This document (Gene by Gene Privacy Policy) is intended to explain how Gene by Gene manages the privacy of your personal data and other information that can be used to identify you, either alone or in combination with other information, including your DNA samples and test results (collectively, “Personal Information”).</p>
            <p>We use your Personal Information to provide you with Gene by Gene services, customized reports and features. Customers who use certain services provided by Gene by Gene are offered an opportunity to sign a Consent Form, also referred to as a Release, specific to each subsidiary which allows them to take full advantage of those services. </p>
            <p>In the absence of a specific Consent Form, this Privacy Document will prevail.</p>
            <p>By using the Gene by Gene websites and the services offered, you consent to the collection, use, storage and disclosure of your Personal Information by Gene by Gene in accordance with this Privacy Document. It should be read in conjunction with the Gene by Gene Terms of Use and Gene by Gene Consent Agreement.</p>

            <h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>
            <p>Gene by Gene collects, processes, stores and shares your Personal Information in a responsible, transparent and secure environment that fosters our customers’ trust and confidence. To that end, Gene by Gene respects your privacy and will not sell or rent your Personal Information without your consent. Personal Information includes, but is not limited to names, phone numbers, physical or mailing addresses, email addresses, and genetic test results. </p>
            <b>How We Use Personal Information </b>
            <p>Gene by Gene collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our products. You provide some of this data directly, such as when you create a Gene by Gene record. Additional data is provided when we deliver your test results or other Gene by Gene products.</p>
            <p>Gene by Gene uses the data we collect to provide you the services we offer, including improving and personalizing your experiences. We may also use the data to communicate with you about your test progress, your account, and to provide product information including occasional marketing offers. You may opt out of receiving marketing communication at any time. </p>
            
            <div id="storage-and-processing">
                <b>Storage and Processing </b>
                <p>When you provide us with any Personal Information, that Personal Information will be stored and processed at the Company’s headquarters adjacent to the Genomics Research Center in Houston, Texas. If you are located outside the USA and still choose to order a DNA Test kit and provide a DNA sample, by providing us with Personal Information, you specifically consent to the transfer, storage and processing of Personal Information to and in the United States, which you recognize may provide a different level of protection for Personal Information and personal data than in your country of residence.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="security">
                <b>Security</b>
                <p>Gene by Gene places great importance on the security of all our customers’ User Submitted Content. We have reasonable and adequate security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of customer data under our control.</p>
                <p>For example, our security and privacy practices are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized personnel have access to Personal Information. We use secure server software to encrypt financial information you input before it is sent to us and we only work with third parties who have met and commit to our security standard. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur, we use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent this.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="use-and-disclosure">
                <b>Use and Disclosure of Personal Information </b>
                <p>When you order an individual test online, we primarily use your Personal Information to provide your test results, to verify and carry out financial transactions relating to payments you make online, and to communicate with you.</p>  
                <p>Gene by Gene discloses your Personal Information to third parties in very limited circumstances as set out below.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">To third party service providers, under the protection of appropriate agreements, so that the third parties may perform various tasks for us. For example, we use third parties to process payments from you. These third parties are only given access to that information needed to perform their services, and are prohibited from using it for other purposes. Processors may include affiliated and unaffiliated service providers in the United States, Europe and in other jurisdictions.  If Gene by Gene wishes to transfer personal information to a third party that is acting as an agent, we will do so only if we enter into a written agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is set forth in this policy.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">To the different Gene by Gene divisions, so that they may use Personal Information for the purposes described in this Privacy Document. Additionally, we might restructure, buy, or sell business units. In these transactions, customer information is often one of the transferred assets, remaining subject to promises made in then prevailing Privacy Documents. Also, in the event that Gene by Gene, or substantially all of its assets or stock, are acquired, transferred, disposed of (in whole or part and including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), Personal Information including test results will as a matter of course be one of the transferred assets.</p>
                <p>We may disclose your Personal Information</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc !important">
                    <li>with your knowledge and any relevant permissions</li>
                    <li>as described in this Privacy Document</li>
                    <li>as may be required by law, regulatory authorities, legal process or to protect the rights or property of Gene by Gene or other Users (including outside your country of residence)</li>
                    <li>to enforce our terms and conditions</li>
                    <li>to protect our rights, privacy, safety, confidentiality, reputation or property, and/or that of Gene by Gene, you or others</li>
                    <li>to prevent fraud or cybercrime</li>
                    <li>to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</b></p>
                <p>Gene by Gene’s accountability for personal data that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Gene by Gene remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Gene by Gene proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. </p>

We may also collect non-personal information such as demographic data, for example your geographic area. Non-personal information also includes personal information that has been aggregated in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Gene by Gene websites.</p>

                <p>Additionally, your consent will be sought for research purposes. Much of the genetic information resulting from DNA testing has not been clinically validated, and the technology we use, which is the same technology used by the research community, to date has not been widely used for clinical testing. For these reasons, our customers are encouraged to participate in Gene by Gene's research initiatives that may contribute to a better understanding of the results of genetic testing. <b>Your participation in these initiatives is entirely voluntary and your DNA test results will not be used or disclosed without your consent. Once given, however, consent cannot be revoked. </b></p>
                <p>We will ask for your consent in several ways. For example: </p>
                <p>A general consent document will be offered to you as part of your decision to participate in any of the Gene by Gene services offered by any of the websites owned and operated by Gene by Gene. Your consent will allow Gene by Gene to share your test results, anonymized and aggregated with those of others who have consented, with our third-party research partners for the purposes of general scientific research intended to lead to publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals.</p>
                <p>From time to time, we may ask for explicit consent to participate in specific research, and upon this consent we may allow our research partners to access your individual test results, which will be kept anonymous, for the purposes of general scientific research intended to lead to publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.</p>
                <p>From time to time, we may ask for explicit consent to participate in specific research, and upon this consent we may allow our research partners to access your individual test results, which will be kept anonymous, for the purposes of scientific research aimed at advancing genetic knowledge and creating, commercializing, or undertaking activities toward the practical applications that may lead to the improvement of health care.</p>
                <p>From time to time, we may ask for explicit consent to allow our research partners to access your non-anonymized individual test results in connection with a specific research project.</p>
                <p>Research partners may include commercial or non-profit organizations that conduct or support population genetic studies, scientific/medical research, or the development of drugs or devices to diagnose, predict, or treat health conditions.  </p>

            <div id="gene-by-gene-account">
                <b>Gene by Gene account </b>
                <p>With a Gene by Gene account you can sign into the specific Gene by Gene service you purchased.  Signing into your account can enable improved personalization, and allows you to access your results. When you sign into your account to access a product, we create a record of that sign-in. </p>  
                <p>Having an account with any of the subsidiaries does not automatically create an account in other subsidiaries.

                <p>Group Projects often have a public website displaying member results so that members can share information more easily. Most groups will also have a member list that is available to members of the project. The list may include name, email address, and haplogroups. You may opt out of this list through the Privacy Settings on your account. </p>
                <p>The free website that Family Tree DNA provides to projects may list member results by kit number. Results tables and maps on the free public website may include a participant’s oldest known ancestor, the ancestor’s country of origin, surname, and full name. Note that any changes you make to your permissions or privacy settings can experience a delay when updating on such public pages. Projects may have a webpage hosted on a different website, either in addition to or in place of the free website Family Tree DNA provides. Those pages should conform to the same privacy assurances as the ones on the Family Tree DNA website. You may wish to discuss with a project administrator what information will be available on the project’s website before joining a project.</p>
                <p>You may join or leave projects at any time at no charge.

        <div id="cancellations-and-refunds">
            <h2>Cancellations and Refunds</h2>
            <p>If ​you cancel the ​DNA testing you have ordered prior to the sample being received at our office, a refund may be given, usually less a handling fee ​that varies based ​on the amount of time that has passed since the purchase:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc !important">
                <li>If cancelled within the first year from the initial order, there will be a $15 or 10% deduction from the amount paid, whichever is greater.</li>
                <li>If cancelled between one year and three years from initial order, there will be a 25% deduction from the amount paid.</li>
                <li>If cancelled three years or more from initial order, there will be a 50% deduction from the amount paid.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will not issue refunds on testing that is in process or completed, including transfers. Once a sample has been sent to our office and checked in, the full cost of the test is absolutely non-refundable.</p>
            <p>If a new test is ordered on an existing kit, you will have a 24-hour window to make changes to the new order. After 24 hours, we are unable to change or refund your order because processing will have already begun. </p>
            <p>Delays in testing do not entitle customers to a refund since scientific procedures may be delayed for a variety of reasons. Testing times vary between products and may vary depending on lab volume and biological sample quality. 
                <b>Expected result dates are predictions and not a guarantee of delivery. </b>
                We will make every effort to ensure that results are delivered for every order, but we do not offer any assurances that we will be able to provide specific results. 
            </p>
            <p>Please note that you must have internet access to view the results on our interactive website. Some items have downloadable and printable components, but many are designed solely for online interaction. Results will not be mailed, and we will not issue refunds for tests bought under the assumption that the results will be mailed.</p>

            <h2>Changing an Order</h2>

                <b>It is the responsibility of the person who orders a test or upgrade to confirm that the mailing address is current at the time of purchase and while the order is being processed.  </b>
                If you remove the mailing address from the records, and we cannot automatically send a new sample kit, we are not responsible for delays. We will not send out a notification that a new collection kit has been sent.

            <h2>Family Finder Tests (Microarray Chip Testing)</h2>
            <p>The Family Finder test uses a microarray chip that is sensitive to the quality of the DNA sample. As a result, our Family Finder testing and refund policy differs from our other tests. We limit Family Finder testing to two attempts. Almost all (98.5%) of Family Finder tests process successfully on the first attempt with a good quality customer swab. Should the first attempt fail, we rerun the test with a second, separate DNA extraction from the secondary sample in our office. If we do not have a secondary sample, a new sample kit will be sent. No refunds will be issued after failed testing if an additional sample is needed and is not obtainable.</p>
            <p>The following refund policies apply:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc !important">
                <li>For Family Finder tests purchased prior to the last 12 months or as an upgrade to a kit ordered over 12 months ago, if the secondary sample fails, you will be sent a new set of vials and swabs so that we can perform a third attempt for free.</li>
                <li>For Family Finder tests purchased during the last 12 months, if the secondary sample fails, you will be contacted regarding the possibility of a third testing attempt with a new sample for a $50 US lab fee. The lab fee is charged because for samples that are less than one year old, the test generally only fails because of the poor quality of the collection.</li>

            We encourage you to search for a family surname in our SURNAMES DATABASE. Our database
            contains family names of clients who have already ordered a DNA profile from Family
            Tree DNA.</p>
        <p>
            After you have searched for the surname that interests you, the name will appear
            in the result screen with a number after the name, e.g. Bowling (62). This indicates
            that the name Bowling is in our database and that 62 people with that surname (or
            a derivative) have already ordered a DNA sample tested. It is possible that not
            all 62 Bowlings have been added yet to our Recent Ancestral Origins (RAO) Database
            as we may be awaiting the analysis from the Lab for some of them.</p>
        <p>
            A link will be provided for you to order a genetic test below the result screen.
            If the surname you desire is not located in our database, you will receive a message
            entitled "Name not found," and a form will be provided below the message to enable
            you to order a test kit for that surname.</p>
        <p>
            Posting and updating to our database is instant. After you have registered your
            surname, you can search again to find the name in the updated database. Happy relative
