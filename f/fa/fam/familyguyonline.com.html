<p><strong>1.         INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twentieth Century Fox Licensing and Merchandising, a division of Fox Entertainment Group, Inc., as Administrator for Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (“Family Guy Online,” “we”, “us,” “our”) operates the website located at www.familyguyonline.com and all corresponding web pages and websites associated with the foregoing URL (“Site”), and any content, applications, features, functionality and other information and services offered from time to time in connection with the Site, including when accessed via the Internet, mobile or other devices (collectively, the “Services").  The Services are part of the United States based operations of News Corporation.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As set forth in our<a href="http://www.familyguyonline.com/terms_of_use"> Terms of Use</a> , the Site is a general audience site which is not targeted to children and use of the Services is limited to users aged 13 years and above.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
This Policy describes our collection and use of users’ personal information (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address), where that information is not otherwise publicly available on the Services.  It also describes generally our practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account.  This Privacy Policy applies to all “users,” including both those who use some of the Services without being registered with the Services and those who have registered with the Services.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<strong>2.         SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON THE SERVICES</strong><em><br>
<br>
</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>User Submitted Information</em></p>
<p><br>
<br>
<strong>Registration Information</strong> is the information that users must provide to us at registration for the Services, for example, in order to create an account, receive a newsletter, take a survey or enter contest or sweepstake.  Registration Information includes information such as account name, one or multiple avatars, email address, and date of birth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Public Information and Posts </strong>consist of your account name, avatar(s) and your game activity, for example your game status and in-game items and your posts and comments on the Services, for example, in forums or blogs.  Your Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results both on the Services and on external search engines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><br>
<br>
User-to-User Communications</strong> may be possible through the Services, such as messages or chats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
<em>Information Collected by the Services</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Site Activity Information.</strong>  When users access the Services, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits.  For example, in order to permit your connection to the Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.  If you access the Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect transactional information such as a unique device identifier assigned to that device, your geolocation, or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.  We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier.  Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site.  We may use these technologies to collect and store information about your usage of the Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Third parties that support the Services by, for example, serving advertisements or providing services, such as, allowing users to communicate, share content, make purchases, or tracking aggregate site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.  We do not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.  For more information about third-party ad networks that use these technologies, see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info">www.aboutads.info.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.  Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies).  Users can manage the use of Flash technologies including cookies with the Flash management tools available at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/ faq.htm">Adobe’s website</a> . Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through the Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><br>
<br>
Third Parties. </strong> To improve the quality of the Services, we may supplement the information we collect with information we obtain from third parties.  If you access the Services through a third-party connection or log-in, we may also collect your user ID and/or user name associated with that third-party service, or any information you have made public in connection with that service or which the third party shares with its partner services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>3.         NOTICE &amp; CHOICE</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br>
Means of Notice.</strong>  This Privacy Policy is the primary means by which we provide you with notice about our collection and use of your personal information.   We will not use your personal information in a manner different from what is described in this Privacy Policy without your permission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong>.  We may modify this Privacy Policy as necessary.  If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that expand our rights to use your personal information, we will notify you to seek your consent through email or prominent posting on the Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Location of Data</strong>.  The Services are hosted in the United States.  If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information you provide transferred to and processed in the United States.  U.S. data protection and other relevant laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction.  As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><br>
<br>
Linked Websites</strong>.  The Services may also be linked to websites and other services operated by our affiliates (i.e., that are part of the News America Group: “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.newscorp.com">Affiliated Companies</a> ”) or third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, features, contests or sweepstakes, applications or other services developed and maintained by third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you leave our Services via a link, enable a third-party service, or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third-party site.  Additionally, although all Affiliated Companies adhere to the News Corporation corporate<a target="_blank" href="http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html"> Privacy Principles</a> , users who visit an Affiliated Company website should still refer to that website’s Privacy Policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><br>
<br>
4.         USE AND DISCLOSURE</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<em>Information Made Public Through Use of The Services</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
User’s Public Information and Posts are publicly available to everyone including other users of the Service, search engines, advertisers and anyone else with access to the Services.  In addition, you understand we are not responsible for the actions of other users who you may communicate with through User-to-User Communications, including for example, if a user shares or otherwise makes your communication publicly available.  <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Use and Disclosure of Information</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We only share your non-public personal information with non-affiliated third parties when we believe sharing is permitted by you or authorized by this Privacy Policy.  We may share your personal information with Affiliated Companies.<br>
<br>
We use the information we collect from and about users for the following purposes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><br>
<br>
To provide and manage the Services.</strong>  We use the information we collect from and about users to provide the Services and features to you including, for example, to measure and improve those services and features, to personalize your experience by delivering relevant content, advertising and marketing messages and to provide you with customer support and respond to inquiries.  We may use aggregated or anonymous data about use of and activity on the Services to assist us in this regard, and the use and disclosure of such data is not subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>To deliver relevant advertising.</strong>  We may use the information you provide to us, and information we collect about your use of the Services through cookies and other technologies, to assist us in delivering you relevant ads when you visit the Services.  We may work with third-party advertising networks and advertisers who help deliver these ads to you.  We do not share your non-public personal information with these third parties, but we may share anonymized or aggregated information with them to improve the relevancy of the ads you see on the Services. As noted above, these third-party advertising networks and advertisers may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect and track non-personally identifiable information such as demographic information, aggregated information, and Internet activity to assist them in delivering advertising that is more relevant to your interests.  To find out more about third-party online advertising and to opt out of this type of advertising, visit the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Network Advertising Initiative website</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>To contact you.</strong>  Family Guy Online may periodically send promotional materials (e.g., newsletters) or notifications related to the Services to the email address you provided to us at registration or to your account.  If you want to stop receiving promotional materials from Family Guy Online, you can follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.  There are certain service notification emails that you may not opt-out of as long as you are registered to use the Services, such as notifications of changes to the Services or policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><br>
<br>
To allow third party service providers to assist us in providing and managing the Services.</strong>  We may make your non-public personal information available to certain third-party service providers, such as contractors, agents or sponsors, who help us manage or provide the Services.  These service providers are required to protect any non-public personal information entrusted to them and not use it for any other purpose than the specific service they are providing to the Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
<strong>To protect the rights of Family Guy Online and our users.</strong>  There may be instances when we may disclose user information without providing notice or choice, including situations where we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of the Services, our Affiliated Companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of users of the Services or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
<strong>To complete a merger or sale of assets</strong>.  If we sell all or part of our business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, we may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>5.         SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
We use commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard user information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>6.         ACCESS AND USER CONTROL</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
You may change your account information or cancel your account by contacting us as described below . Remember that even after you cancel your account, copies of some information associated with your account, including publicly viewable comments or other material you have posted on the Services or on other websites and applications via the Services, may remain viewable in some circumstances.  We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies.  Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others, and there may be a delay in the removal of the content from elsewhere on the Internet and from search engines.</p>
