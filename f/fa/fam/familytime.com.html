<p>
<font class="head">What is our mission?</font><br>
FamilyTime's mission is to help you save time and money by helping you organize your household activities.  
We do this by providing useful planning tools and by getting the best of web offers and practical content for
 your family. We do the surfing, so you  save time to be with your family. To do this well, we become a 
 trusted partner to you. We will not sell or give individual data about you to third parties. 
</p>
<p>
<font class="head">Is there a cost?</font><br>
The FamilyTime Site is offered as a free service.  It is paid for by advertisers and sponsors who 
want you to know about their products and services.  We will use certain registration and tracking 
data,  as outlined below, to make your experience using FamilyTime more enjoyable and more valuable 
to you by screening certain ads and offers.
</p>
<p>
 <font class="head">What happens to your stored information?</font> <br>
One key powerful feature of the FamilyTime Site is that you can store information about your family 
in a central location on the Internet.  This gives you and your family the convenience and power of 
accessing, for example, a family calendar and updating it from any PC on the Internet when you are 
at work, at school, or travelling.
</p>
<p>
We make every reasonable effort to safeguard that data for you and to assure that it will be there 
when you need it.  All of the information that you put into any FamilyTime application (calendar, 
recipes file cabinet, etc.) about your family is your own. The information is backed up on our 
servers to help protect against loss, and it is NOT made available by us to any third party in 
any form.  You can remove the information at any time by deleting it or canceling your registration 
with us. All FamilyTime services are furnished AS IS, subject to the Limitations of Liability 
and EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES set forth in our <a href="TermsConditions.asp?UserID=&amp;key=">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>.  
Please review those Terms and Conditions for further details.
</p>
<p>
<font class="head">Do we use the information that you store in the FamilyTime program?</font><br>
As stated above, the areas provided to store personal data, are just that - storage areas - and 
are NOT used in any way to direct ads or offers to you.  Corporate Sponsorships are offered for 
FamilyTime sections based on the general subject area of the section, not on your personal information 
held within any section.  None of the individual data in any of these sections is given or sold 
to a third party by FamilyTime.
</p>
<p>
Data that you generate in collecting recipes, creating menus, and creating shopping lists is 
aggregated to help us and our sponsors understand what foods, menus, and products are most 
popular.  The data is never used in a manner that can be traced to an identified individual.
</p>
<p>
<font class="head">What information does the FamilyTime Site need at registration?</font><br>
We require one name and email address for each family at the time of registration. In addition, 
we require zip code to provide you with relevant local offers.  We will email you to let you 
know about new features or other offers of interest from FamilyTime, or to address customer 
needs and requests. Other family members can use the FamilyTime site without registering as 
long as they have access to the family password.  Other data collected at registration is 
used to direct relevant ads and information to you as part of using FamilyTime.
</p>
<p>
<font class="head">What are "cookies" and how does the FamilyTime Site use them?</font><br>
We track your visit to our site by giving you a "cookie."  Cookies are pieces of information 
that Web sites transfer to your computer's hard drive for record keeping purposes.  They make 
the creation of the FamilyTime application possible by allowing the site to save preferences 
and remember what operations you have completed.  Cookies also help FamilyTime collect 
anonymous click stream data for tracking user trends and patterns. The use of cookies is 
now quite common,  and you'll find them used on most major Web sites.  Most browsers are 
initially set up to accept cookies.  If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to 
notify you when you've received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies.  You should 
understand that FamilyTime will not function properly,  if you set your browser to 
reject cookies.
</p>

<p>
<font class="head">What happens to information you give to Advertisers?</font><br>
If you leave the Site via a link to an advertiser, coupon provider or other merchant, 
you will then be subject to the privacy policy on that company's web site.  It is up 
to you to investigate the policy of any other site(s) you visit, via links or otherwise, 
to decide which sites you wish to visit, and to decide what information, if any, you 
wish to provide on those sites. 
</p>
<p> 
<font class="head">Does FamilyTime share information?</font><br>
Except as described in this privacy policy, FamilyTime will never willfully disclose 
individually identifiable information about its users to any third party without first 
receiving that user's permission.
</p>
<p>
<font class="head">How do you "Opt-out"?</font><br>
You will always be asked if you want to receive messages from FamilyTime.  Even if 
you opt-in to a program, you will be offered the ability to opt-out of receiving 
information by email or mailing via following directions included with each 
correspondence.
</p>
<p>
<font class="head">Notification of Changes</font><br>
If at some point in the future, there is a change to our information usage
practices that affect your Personally Identifiable Information, we will
notify you by email of the relevant changes. At the time of this message, you will be
able to opt-out of this information usage by sending a message to the
following email:<a href="mailto:customerservices@familytime.com">customerservices@familytime.com</a>. You should also check this posted privacy
statement for changes.  We welcome any 
questions or comments you have, please direct them to customerservices@familytime.com 
or write to Customer Services, FamilyTime, 1552 Post Road, Fairfield, 
CT 06430. (203) 292-2440.

Your experience and privacy are very important to us and we respect your rights.<br>
