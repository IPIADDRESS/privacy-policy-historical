<b>Last updated April 6, 2015</b>
<p>
FamilyTreeNow.com, Inc. (“FamilyTreeNow.com”, "us", "our" or "we") who owns and controls the website found at FamilyTreeNow.com has developed this Privacy Policy which details important information regarding the use and disclosure of user information collected on FamilyTreeNow.com, and any successor websites, (collectively, the “Site”), and other interactive properties, including but not limited to our mobile applications and mobile-focused websites (the Site and other FamilyTreeNow.com’ interactive properties are collectively referred to herein as the “ FamilyTreeNow.com Applications"). This Privacy Policy also applies to our offline collection of information.
</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Use (“Terms”). By clicking your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use during the registration process on the Site you are entering into a legally binding agreement with FamilyTreeNow.com based upon the terms of these policies. Each time that you access FamilyTreeNow.com Applications or our Services you signify that you agree to be bound by the Terms and this Privacy Policy, acknowledge that we are not providing you with a consumer report, and agree that you will not use the information obtained from us for any purpose covered by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. §1681, et seq.). If you do not agree to the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the FamilyTreeNow.com Applications or Services.
</p>
<p>
<b>I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b>
</p>
<p><b><u>Information Provided Directly by You To FamilyTreeNow.com</u></b></p>
<p>
<b>Registration Information.</b> We will collect personal information from you if you register with us or subscribe to our Services ("Personal Information"). Any information you provide before registering with us is not associated with you individually and is not retained by FamilyTreeNow.com unless you register with us. When you register you are required to provide certain categories of information, such as name, e-mail address, and a password.
</p>
<p>
<b>Searching for people.</b> When you are searching for people, you may enter third party personal information such as their name, address, or phone. We only use the data you input to provide you with a search request. We retain the results of your search requests for a period of time at our discretion but do not use that information for any other purpose and have no obligation to maintain such search results.
</p>
<p>
<b>Opt Out of Living People Records.</b> Your privacy is important to us. If you would like your records removed from our database, please <a href="/optout">opt out here</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Family Tree Privacy.</b> User-created Family trees have 3 levels of privacy that you can set at any time.
<br>
</p><ul>
<li>
Public wtih hidden living people details - All information for deceased individuals will be public. All information except for last name
and first initial will be made private for all minors. For living non-minors, full dob, bio, and any media (photos, etc.) are private. "Private"
means that only you and people you explicitly shared your tree with can view the private content.
</li>
<li>
Private - Everything in this tree is private including all records, media, profiles, and everything else. This setting means only you and
people you explicitly shared your tree with can view the tree.
</li>
<li>
Public with nothing hidden - All information is public. You would typically only use this setting if you were creating a family tree
for famous people, historical figures, etc. For example if you created an 'English Royal Family Tree' you would want this to be totally
public.
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
<b>Optional Information.</b> At various other points during your visit to FamilyTreeNow.com, you may be asked to provide information about yourself. The use of other services which require the input of additional information is completely voluntary on your part. You have the choice about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features of our FamilyTreeNow.com Applications.
</p>
<p>
<b>Feedback.</b> In addition, during your visit to our Site, you may be asked to provide feedback, ideas, suggestions, and/or proposals (“Feedback”) with regard to our products and services. Submission of Feedback is optional, although encouraged, as it allows FamilyTreeNow.com to better address our users’ needs and continuously work towards improving our products and services. By submitting your Feedback, you acknowledge and agree that (1) such Feedback does not contain confidential or proprietary information; (2) FamilyTreeNow.com shall be entitled to use or disclose (or choose not to disclose) any such Feedback for any purpose, in any way, in any media worldwide; (3) you irrevocably assign to FamilyTreeNow.com all rights to your Feedback; (4) FamilyTreeNow.com is not under any obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Feedback; and (5) you are not entitled to any compensation or reimbursement of any kind from FamilyTreeNow.com under any circumstances for submission of your Feedback.
</p>
<p>
<b>User Generated Content.</b> The Services may contain review or chat areas and/or other message, communication or other mechanisms designed to enable you to communicate with others or to post content on the Site (the “Communication Services”). Please remember that any information you disclose while participating with the Communication Services becomes public information, becomes the property of, and is subject to redistribution by, FamilyTreeNow.com. You should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting. There is no expectation of privacy when playing, posting, or otherwise participating on the Communication Services. If you post content, please be aware that any personally identifiable information contained in such content is accessible to registered users or visitors to that FamilyTreeNow.com Application or Communication Service and we have no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information. We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the Communication Services. We reserve the right to take action in connection with any content we deem to be inappropriate. Please review our Terms of Use for more information regarding your appropriate use of these Communication Services.
</p>
<p><b><u>Information Collected Through Technology and Advertising </u></b></p>
<p>
In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the FamilyTreeNow.com Applications (“Usage Information”), including the device used to access FamilyTreeNow.com Applications (“Device”), and the IP address or other unique identifier identified by that Device (“Device Identifier”). Your Device Identifier may also identify your regional location. This Usage Information is used for many purposes including, for example, to:

<li>Deliver relevant content based on your preferences, usage patterns and location </li>
<li>Monitor and evaluate the use and operation of our FamilyTreeNow.com Applications </li>
<li>Analyze traffic on our FamilyTreeNow.com Applications and on the sites and applications of third parties </li>
<li>We may associate this tracking data with your registration account, in which case we will treat it as personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
Third party service providers might combine information they collect from your interaction with FamilyTreeNow.com Applications with personal information they collect from other sources. We do not have access to, nor control over, third parties' use of tracking technologies. Service providers that collect tracking data on our behalf may provide an opportunity for you to choose not to be tracked online. If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the FamilyTreeNow.com Applications may not function properly. For instance, if cookies are disabled, you will not be able to log into our FamilyTreeNow.com Applications.
</p>
<p>
We use Google Analytics for our traffic tracking. Google provides a way to opt out of tracking <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">here</a>.
</p>
<p><b><u>Information You Provide About a Third Party</u></b></p>
<p>
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Services, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.

We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and for tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may e-mail us by using our contact form located at http://www.familytreenow.com/contact to request that we remove this information from our database.

</p>
<p><b><u>Information We Collect From Third Parties</u></b></p>

We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically, such as demographic and lifestyle information.

</p>
<p><b><u>Advertising</u></b></p>
<p>
Advertisers and third parties also may collect information about your activity on FamilyTreeNow.com Applications and on third-party sites and applications using tracking technologies. Tracking data collected by these advertisers and third parties is used to decide which ads you see both on our FamilyTreeNow.com Applications and on third-party sites and applications, but does not identify you personally and is not associated with your registration account. We do not have access to or control over information that may be collected by advertisers and third parties, but many ad networks, data exchanges, marketing analytics and other service providers may allow you to choose not to receive their targeted advertising. We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Additionally, you may also opt-out specifically to Rubicon Project <a href="http://www.rubiconproject.com/privacy/consumer-online-profile-and-opt-out/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>II. HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Use of Information by Us.</b> We may use Information that we collect about you: (1) to provide you with information or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive; (2) to provide you with information regarding new features, products or services; (3) to improve the FamilyTreeNow.com Applications or our Services and to customize your experience; (4) to contact you with regard to your use of the FamilyTreeNow.com Applications and, in our discretion, changes to the FamilyTreeNow.com Applications and/or the FamilyTreeNow.com Applications’ policies; (5) for internal business purposes; (6) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information, and (7) as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
<b>Contacting You.</b> When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise sign up for our Services or provide your contact information, including an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product or service, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you about FamilyTreeNow.com using the information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you. This means you may be contacted in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.
</p>
<p>
<b>Transactional Communications.</b> We may send you notices from time to time relating to your account or your orders. These may include order confirmations, invoices or customer service notifications. We may also send you service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so; for instance, if our Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, or the delivery of a product is delayed or there is some service issue with something you may have ordered. You may not opt-out of receiving these communications, which are not promotional in nature.
</p>
<p>
<b>Service Providers.</b> We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and the FamilyTreeNow.com Applications or administer activities on our behalf. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes.
</p>
<p>
<b>Electronic Promotional Offers.</b> We may send you promotional emails regarding special offers about our Services. You may choose not to receive our promotional communications by clicking the unsubscribe link in the footer of any email. After unsubscribing or closing your account, we cannot guarantee that you will never receive another marketing mailing from us, because we may obtain your e-mail address in the future through a different e-mail marketing program that you have opted into. Unsubscribing from one marketing list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all marketing lists. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving promotional e-mails, we may continue to send you electronic service or transactional notifications that are related to your account(s), orders or other services you have requested, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.

Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party. If you elect to register for the products and/or services provided at these Co-Branded Areas, you either will be providing your Personal Information to both us and the third party or we might be providing your Personal Information directly to the third party in order for that third party to fulfill their products and services directly with you. Your Personal Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy as well as the privacy policy and practices of such third party. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties and we suggest you review the individual privacy policies of each company with whom you establish a relationship. You should consult the respective privacy policies of those third party sponsors or advertisers to learn more about their privacy practices.
</p>
