                    Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function

                    Clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller than cookies,

                    clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been

                    We may store information that we collect to create a profile of our users.
                    A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that
                    detail their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information may
                    be tied to users' personally identifiable information to improve the

                    receive those promotions. We do not share personally identifiable elements
                    of a user’s profile with other third parties. User profiles are shared in

                </p>
                <p>
                    Certain web browsers may allow you to enable a “do not track” option that
                    sends signals to the websites you visit indicating that you do not want
                    your online activities tracked. This is different from blocking cookies as
                    browsers with the “do not track” option selected may still accept cookies.
                    Right now, there is no industry standard for how companies should respond
                    to “do not track” signals, although one may be adopted in the future. We do
                    not respond to “do not track” signals at this time. If we do so in the
                    future, we will modify this Privacy Policy accordingly. More information
                about “do not track” is available at    <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.org">www.allaboutdnt.org</a>.
