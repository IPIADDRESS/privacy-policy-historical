          broadcast campaign is specific to the company or individual that creates

          We care about the safety and security of your transaction. We use high 
          grade encryption and the https security protocol to communicate with 
          your browser software. This method is the industry standard security 
          protocol, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept 
          the credit card information you send to us.</p>
