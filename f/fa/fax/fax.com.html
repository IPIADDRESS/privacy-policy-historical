<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<a name="top"></a>
<div class="leftIndent"><br>
This Privacy Policy is effective on October 30, 2009 for current users, and upon acceptance for new
users.
<br><br>
j2 Cloud Services, Inc., (the "Company", "we", "us" or "our") is dedicated to establishing trusting
relationships with our users by respecting their personal identity and by promoting the use of fair
information practices. This privacy policy ("Policy") covers the information practices relating to
the Fax.com Website, <a href="http://www.fax.com">www.fax.com</a> ("Site") and all Fax.com
services ("Services") offered now or in the future. For purposes of this policy, "account" is defined
as the account through which you access the Services. We do not share information obtained from users
through our Site or Services with third parties except as otherwise specifically set forth in this
Policy. In this Policy we describe the following:




 <ol>
    <li><a href="#10">What personally identifiable information the Company collects.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#20">How the Company uses the information and with whom the Company may
share users' information.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#30">What choices are available to users regarding collection, use and
distribution of the information.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#40">What types of security procedures are in place to protect the loss,
misuse or alteration of this information to the extent under the Company's control.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#50">How users can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#60">How we will notify you of any changes to this Policy.</a></li>

<br><br>

<h2><a name="10"></a>1. Information Collection</h2>
The Company collects information from its users at several different points on the Site and through
the Services, both directly from users (including through interactions with Customer Service and
Sales) and through the use of technologies such as cookies, log files and clear gifs.
<div class="leftIndent">
<h3>A. Registration</h3>
In order to use the Services, you must first complete the registration process. During registration
you are required to provide contact information such as name, phone number and email address. We use
this registration information to contact you about the Services and other services offered by the
Company for which you have expressed interest or that you might be interested in. We may request or
require that users provide general demographic information (such as income level and gender), so we
can provide a more personalized experience. Paying users must also provide payment information (such
as a credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to
fill users' orders. If we have trouble processing a user's order and/or collecting payment, the
contact information is used to contact the user. If you begin but fail to complete the registration
process for the Services, we may contact you in an effort to help you sign up for Services or another
Company service. You can opt-out of receiving these emails by clicking on the opt-out link included
in the emails.
<h3>B. Test Fax.com</h3>
If you elect to use the Test Fax.com tool on the Site, you will automatically receive a sample fax
by email. We may also send you other emails containing information about the Company's services. You
can opt-out of receiving these emails by clicking on the opt-out link included in the emails.
<h3>C. Cookies</h3>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on users' computers tied to information about the users. We may
use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the
browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small file stored on users' hard
drives for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet
browser help file directions. Use of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable
information while on the Site except if users choose to store their user names so that users do not
have to enter it each time they access their account. Then a persistent cookie will be stored on your
computer which is linked to your account information. If you reject the persistent cookie, you may
still use the Site but you will be limited in some areas of it. Persistent cookies also enable us to
track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on the Site. See the
"Profile" section below. Some of our business partners (for example, third party advertisers) may use
cookies on the Site, in emails or in our advertisements on other Websites. The cookies are not linked
to any personally identifiable information. This Policy covers the use of cookies by the Company and
does not cover the use of cookies by any third party advertisers. Our third party advertisers have
their own privacy policies which you should consult. In order to create a user-friendly experience,
some of our third party promotions and advertisements are designed to automatically transmit users'
information onto the third party's landing page when users chooses to "click" upon a third party's
advertisement or promotion. For more information about receiving the Company's advertisements on
other Websites, and for opting out of this practice, please see the "Choice/Opt-out" section below.
<h3>D. Log Files</h3>
Like most Websites, our servers use log files to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users'
movements in the aggregate and gather information to improve the user experience and the Services.
<h3>E. Clear Gifs</h3>
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and we may use
them to track the online movements of our users. Clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much
smaller than cookies, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may also use clear
gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This

<h3>F. Profile</h3>

their viewing preferences and Services usage. We may also gather information about users and users'
preferences from third parties. Please see the Third Party Intermediaries; Supplementation of
Information section below. Consequently, information may be tied to users' personally identifiable
information to improve the content of the Site for users, improve our Services and provide new
services that are likely to be of interest to users and to direct pertinent product updates and
marketing promotions to users if they have opted in to receive those promotions.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that
we have personal information of a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our

<div class="leftIndent">
<h3>A.  Legal, Security and Safety</h3>
The Company does not release personally identifying information about our users (other than as
disclosed in this Policy) or monitor, edit or disclose the contents of users' private communications
through the Services except where the Company in good faith believes that such action is necessary
to: (1) comply with the law or where we have a good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to
comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us; (2)
investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activity; (3) protect and defend the rights or
property of the Company; or (4) to protect the personal safety of our users or the public. For
example, we may disclose personal information to law enforcement, other government officials or third
parties in response to criminal or civil subpoenas. Sometimes, these subpoena requests come from our
third party Internet, telecommunications and collocation providers all over the world who supply the
network required for us to deliver our Services. In order to maintain the integrity of our network,
we often cooperate with requests from these third party providers and/or requests from law
enforcement or other governmental officials directed to these providers.  In cases where the Company
believes that disclosure of any information about a user (including account information) is
necessary, we reserve the right to disclose all information in our possession about such user.

<h3>B. Civil Subpoena Policy</h3>
To request user information from the Company in a civil case, you must lawfully serve the Company with a valid 
subpoena, court order, or search warrant, comply with all applicable federal, state, and other applicable laws, 
rules, and regulations, and agree to the Company's terms of compensation below.  All civil subpoenas should be 
directed to: j2 Cloud Services, Inc.; Subpoena Department; 6922 Hollywood Boulevard; Suite 500; Los Angeles, CA 90028. 
The Company reserves all rights, objections, and entitlements with respect to any subpoena served on it, and 
may choose to notify any subscriber or other party whose information is sought. The Company additionally 
reserves the right to insist on reimbursement of its reasonable expenses incurred in responding to any subpoena, 
including without limitation all expenditures of internal staff time, copying and clerical expenses, 
and mailing expenses. The Company may invoice the person or entity submitting the subpoena following receipt 
and the subpoena proponent must make payment promptly, but in no event more than 15 days, after the invoice is sent. 
Checks should be made out to j2 Cloud Services, Inc.


<h3>C. Provision of Services</h3>

requirements.

<h3>D. Welcome Email and Special Offer</h3>
We send all new users a welcome email to verify their information such as name, address and phone
number. Users may occasionally receive emails promoting the Company's services and third party
services that may be of interest to them ("Promotional Emails"). To opt-out of receiving these
Promotional Emails, please see the Choice / Opt-out section below. We may also contact users by other
communication channels such as telephone or mail using contact information provided by users or
obtained from third party sources as set forth in the section on Third Party Intermediaries;
Supplementation of Information below.

<h3>E. Product Updates, Newsletters, Service Announcements</h3>
We might send you communications which contain usage tips, product updates or updates to the Customer

<h3>F. Customer Service</h3>
We communicate with users in reply to requests for assistance or regarding issues relating to users'
accounts. We may reply via email, phone, Web chat, mail or other available method, in accordance with
users' wishes.

<h3>G. Abuse; Spam and Junk Faxes</h3>
The Company has a zero tolerance policy for abuse. While we cannot be responsible for external
communications received through the Services, it is our intention to use all legally available means
to prevent use of the Services for any illegal purpose, including but not limited to distribution and
receipt of unsolicited commercial faxes ("junk faxes"). We also specifically restrict users from
taking any actions which impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the Company's
resources. We ask that any users who are annoyed by receipt of such junk faxes or otherwise impacted
by illegal use of the Services to please report such activity.

<h3>H. Third Party Intermediaries; Supplementation of Information</h3>
In order for the Company to properly fulfill its obligations, to improve our Services and direct
information to users about services that may be of interest to users, we use third parties and we may
share users' information with these third parties. For example, the Company verifies the billing
address on all credit card transactions and may obtain credit reports for some corporate users. We
use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for Services. In addition, we may use
third parties to host certain portions of our Site, to fulfill certain requests for information from
our users and to comply with legal requirements. In order to personalize a user's experience and
provide relevant offers from us or our third party advertisers, we may share users' information with
third parties to learn more about users and their preferences. These companies are not to store or
use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes and the information obtained from
these third party sources is maintained in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.

program.

<h2><a name="40"></a>4. Security</h2>

The Company takes every reasonable precaution to protect its users' information. Our
registration/order forms ask users to enter their personally identifiable information, that
information is protected with encryption software called SSL. Any activities after you log into your
account are also encrypted with SSL.
<br><br>
While we use SSL encryption to protect personally identifiable information online, we also employ
security measures to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the
personally identifiable information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who
need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerks or a Customer Service
representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the Company
servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.

<h2><a name="50"></a>5. Changing Your Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as phone, credit card, email or postal
address), users can change their information by logging into their account on the Site. If users have
cancelled their account, they must call Customer Service to change their personally identifiable
information.

<br>
<br>
<a href="#top">top</a>

<h2><a name="60"></a>6. Notification of Changes</h2>
If we decide to change our Policy in a non-material way, we will post those changes in this Policy,
and other places we deem appropriate, so our users are always aware of what information we collect,
how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in
accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
<br>
<br>
If, however, we change our Policy in a material way, we will notify users via email. Users will have
a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users
have deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted if we change our Policy in a
material way, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner.

<h2><a name="80"></a>8. Data Retention</h2>
The time period for which we keep information varies according to how we use the information. In some
cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period. Unless there is a specific
legal requirement for us to keep the information, we do not retain it for no longer than is necessary
for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.
