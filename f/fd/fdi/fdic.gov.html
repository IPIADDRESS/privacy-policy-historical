The cookie captures no personally identifying information.  The FDIC server uses this information to provide certain features during your visit to the Web site. You can set your browser to warn you when placement of a cookie is requested, and decide whether or not to accept it.  By rejecting a cookie some of the features available on the site may not function properly. 

</p><p>Other than the automatic data collection described above, this site collects no personally identifying information.  <b>The sole exception is when you knowingly and voluntarily provide information</b>, such as when you fill in your name and address on the FOIA request form.

</p><p>The FDIC uses the information we collect for internal system administrative purposes to measure the volume of requests for specific web site pages, and to continually improve the FDIC Internet site to be responsive to the needs of users.  Your choice to use the FDIC Web site or to send electronic mail to FDIC will be considered your consent for the FDIC to use the information collected therefrom as stated in this notice.

<b><u><font color="#000080" size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Verdana">Information Collected From You</font></u></b>
</p><p>You may decide to send the FDIC information, including personally identifying information.  The information you supply – whether through a secure Web form, a standard Web form, or by sending an electronic mail message – is maintained by the FDIC for the purpose of processing your request or inquiry.

</p><p>Various employees of the FDIC may see the information you submit in the course of their official duties.  The information may also be shared by the FDIC with third parties to advance the purpose for which you provide the information, including other federal or state government agencies.  For example, if you file a complaint, it may be sent to a financial institution for action, or information may be supplied to the Department of Justice in the event it appears that federal criminal statutes have been violated by an entity you are reporting to the FDIC.  The primary use of personally identifying information will be to enable the government to contact you in the event we have questions regarding the information you have reported.
