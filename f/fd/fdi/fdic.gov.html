<p>The FDIC is strongly committed to maintaining the privacy of your personal information. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site.  The information the FDIC receives depends upon your actions when visiting the Corporation’s web site.  

</p><p></p><p><br>

<b><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica">Information Collected About Your Visit to the Web Site</font></b>
</p><p>The FDIC automatically collects and stores the following information about you when you visit our Web site:

</p><ul><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">
<li>The date and time the request was received.</li>
<li>Your Internet Protocol (IP) address, or the proxy address of your Internet Service Provider (e.g. AOL, CompuServe, and so on). </li>
<li>The name and IP address of the FDIC server that received and logged the request.</li>
<li>The resource on an FDIC server accessed as a result of the request, such as the Web page, image, and so on.</li>
<li>The query in the request.  This field captures any criteria or parameters issued with a query, such as a bank name or insurance certificate number. </li>
<li>The name and version of your Web browser (e.g. Netscape 4.0).</li>
<li>The content of any sent or received cookie.  </li>
<li>The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that was accessed before the user made a request for FDIC’s Web server.  The URL may be an outside address that is not related to the FDIC server.</li>
<li>Other status codes and values resulting from the Web server responding to the request received: HTTP status code, Windows NT code, number of bytes sent, number of bytes received, duration (in seconds) to fulfill the request, server port number addressed, and protocol version.</li>
<li>For a brief period at the beginning of 2002, FDIC's home page will include a small program to collect information on the screen resolution setting of your PC (e.g. 800 x 600, 1280 x 1024, etc.).  This information will be used to adjust FDIC design standards so the pages we produce will be as readable as possible on your computer display.</li>
</font></ul><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">


<p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Some parts of the FDIC Web site may use a "cookie", which is a file placed on your computer hard drive, that allows the FDIC web server to log the pages you use in the FDIC site and to determine if you have visited the site before.  The cookie captures no personally identifying information.  The FDIC server uses this information to provide certain features during your visit to the Web site. You can set your browser to warn you when placement of a cookie is requested, and decide whether or not to accept it.  By rejecting a cookie some of the features available on the site may not function properly. 

</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Other than the automatic data collection described above, this site collects no personally identifying information.  <b>The sole exception is when you knowingly and voluntarily provide information</b>, such as when you fill in your name and address on the FOIA request form.

</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">The FDIC uses the information we collect for internal system administrative purposes to measure the volume of requests for specific web site pages, and to continually improve the FDIC Internet site to be responsive to the needs of users.

<b><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica">Intrusion Detection Monitoring</font></b>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">This government computer system employs software security programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.  Such attempts are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.  Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits.

<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">
</font></font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">You may decide to send the FDIC information, including personally identifying information.  The information you supply – whether through a secure Web form, a standard Web form, or by sending an electronic mail message – is maintained by the FDIC for the purpose of processing your request or inquiry.  The FDIC also uses the information you supply in other ways to further the FDIC’s mission of maintaining stability and public confidence in the nation’s banking system.  

</font></font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Various employees of the FDIC may see the information you submit in the course of their official duties.  The information may also be shared by the FDIC with third parties to advance the purpose for which you provide the information, including other federal or state government agencies.  For example, if you file a complaint, it may be sent to a financial institution for action, or information may be supplied to the Department of Justice in the event it appears that federal criminal statutes have been violated by an entity you are reporting to the FDIC.  The primary use of personally identifying information will be to enable the government to contact you in the event we have questions regarding the information you have reported.

</font></font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Under certain circumstances, the FDIC may be required by law to disclose information you submit to the Corporation, for example, to respond to a Congressional inquiry or subpoena.

</font></font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">If you register with an FDIC online mailing list, the information you provide may also be used to send you FDIC communiqués or notify you about updates to our web site.

</font></font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">When you choose to send e-mail to the FDIC you are consenting to the FDIC using the information provided therein, including personally identifying information, in accordance with this notice, unless you expressly state in the e-mail your objection to any use(s).
