        fgog.net is committed to protecting your privacy online. To further this commitment, we have adopted an online
        privacy policy that guides how we collect, store, and use information collected about you online.
      </div>
      <p></p>

      <p>
        <b class="medium_gray_title privacy_font"> What information does fgog.net collect?</b><br>
        FGOG may request and/or collect non-private information from you when you use fgog.net and/or register. For the
        protection of your privacy, we ask that you avoid sending us any and all personally identifiable information.

      <p>
        <b class="medium_gray_title privacy_font"> Cookies</b><br>
        fgog.net may use cookies to improve the use of our websites. A "cookie" is a small file that websites often
        store on a user's computer. Storage of cookies on your system provides an easy and convenient method for us to
        personalize your experience on our websites. For example, cookies allow us to remember your screen name, tell us
        that you have visited our website before, and may contain information that will make your next visit to our
        website more enjoyable. We do not use cookies to store personally identifiable information.
        Additionally, FGOG may use cookies and third party vendors to deliver ads related to FGOG to you while you are
        surfing other websites. If you would like to opt-out of such ads, you may visit
        http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp to opt-out of such use of cookies.

      <p><b class="medium_gray_title privacy_font"> Log Files</b><br>
        Other non-personal information collected by fgog.net is in the form of logs - files that record website
        activity, including how many "hits" a particular web page is getting (a.k.a., "click-through data"). For
        example, log file entries are generated every time a visitor clicks the "Home" icon on our site. These entries
        enable fgog.net to assess overall site activity, and improve the general user experience. Through the use of log
        files, we may also collect certain information about your system such as the type of browser you are using
        (e.g., Chrome, Internet Explorer) and the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows or Mac OS).
