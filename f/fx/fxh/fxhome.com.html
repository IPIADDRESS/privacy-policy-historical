	<h3>Marketing</h3>
	<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.</p>

	<h3>Promotional offers from us </h3>
	<p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Account Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products and offers may be relevant for you.</p>
	<p>You may receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased products from us and, in each case, you have provided us with your consent to receive such communications and not opted out of receiving that marketing.</p>

	<h3>Third-party marketing</h3>
	<p>We may occasionally use a third party such as SurveyMonkey or Mailchimp to help us administer our customer surveys or marketing communications however we will only do so where we are confident that appropriate safeguards and measures are in place. Outside of that we will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside FXhome for marketing purposes.</p>

	<h3>Opting out</h3>
	<p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages by contacting us directly, via your account or by clicking the link at the bottom of our marketing emails.</p>
	<p>Where you opt-out of receiving these marketing messages, we will remove you from further communications as soon as possible. Please note that opting-out will not mean that we delete all data that we hold about you as we will still need to retain this information for our records and pursuant to our legitimate business interests.</p>

	<h3>Change of purpose</h3>
	<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us directly, via your account or by clicking the link at the bottom of our marketing emails.</p>
	<p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
	<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>

	<h3>LAWFUL BASIS</h3>
	<p><strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by <a href="mailto:privacy@fxhome.com">contacting us</a></p>

	<h2 id="section11">11. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h2>
	<p>You have the right to:</p>
	<p id="right-access"><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
	<p id="right-correct"><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
	<p id="right-erasure"><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. </p>
	<p id="right-object"><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
	<p id="right-restrict"><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. </p>
	<p id="right-transfer"><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. </p>
	<p id="right-withdraw"><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
