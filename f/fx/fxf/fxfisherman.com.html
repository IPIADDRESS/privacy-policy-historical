<h2>Privacy Policy Statement</h2><div class="box">
<p>This Privacy Policy Statement describes how the FxFisherman.com handles personal information that it receives through this web site. Throughout this Statement, “we” and “us” refer to the FxFisherman.com.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>  <h3>Registration</h3> <p>Registration is not necessary for the public to use this Web site. However, members must register in order to gain access to the “members only” portion of the Web site and to subscribe to specific working groups. During registration, you must complete the registration form and create a user name and password. During registration you are required to give us contact information. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.</p>  <p>The FxFisherman.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this Web site.</p>  <h3>Member Billing</h3> In connection with applications for membership and membership billing, we collect contact information and financial information. We use this information for billing purposes and to process your membership application. If we have trouble processing your application or your billing instructions, we will use this information to contact you.  <h3>Controlled Materials</h3> In certain instances, you may only obtain materials or information from this Web site if you provide contact information and other personally identifiable information. We use this information to identify who is receiving these materials and how they are being used.  <h2>Communications from the Web Site</h2>  <h3>Generally</h3> We use the personally identifiable information we receive to provide member services to you by, for example, setting up working group subscriptions that you select, delivering member newsletters to you, and providing you with information about developments and events that we believe will be of interest to our members. You may subscribe or unsubscribe from each group at any time in order to control your receipt of working group communications. You may not unsubscribe from “all-members” communications as we use this channel of communication to provide information and materials that are necessary for membership.  <h3>Customer Service</h3> Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.  <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>  <h3>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</h3> We may elect to share aggregated demographic information about our user base for purposes that support and promote the FxFisherman.com’s mission. This information does not identify individual users. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.  <h3>Personally identifiable information:</h3> We disclose personally identifiable information of our members, namely their contact information, to other members to facilitate membership activities, particularly in the working groups. We do not share personally identifiable information with outside third parties.  <h3>Service Providers</h3> We use other third parties to provide certain services, such as the hosting and maintenance of our Web site, event registration services, Web-based meetings and other services that we may elect to provide to our members. Some of these services are provided through the use of FxFisherman.com-branded or co-branded Web pages located on the service providers’ Web sites, which means that certain information you provide to the FxFisherman.com in connection with requested services will be delivered and stored on the service providers’ servers. When you sign up for specific services, or as required in connection with Web site hosting, maintenance and operation, we will share only that personally identifiable information that is necessary for the third party to provide the services.

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information and we do not provide it to third parties. <h2>Cookies and Clear GIFs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h2>  A “cookie” is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. A “clear GIF,” also known as a “Web beacon” or “Web bug,” is a transparent graphic image that can be used to monitor a user’s interaction with a Web site.
