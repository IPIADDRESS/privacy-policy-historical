<br>FOREXSTREET’s Privacy Pledge
<br>
<br>FOREXSTREET complies with the legal requirements set out in the Spanish Personal Data Protection Act 15/1999, of December 13th (“Ley Orgánica de Protección de Datos Personales”). The term "personal data" as used in this Policy refers to information such as your name, e-mail address or mailing address, or any data that can be used to identify you. We ensure that our staff and those acting on our behalf obtain, use and disclose personal information lawfully and correctly.
<br>
<br>Right of information 
<br>
<br>In compliance with the Spanish Personal Data Protection Act (“Ley Orgánica de Protección de Datos Personales”), FOREXSTREET informs you about the existence of an automated data file for which FOREXSTREET assumes sole responsibility. The referred file has been duly registered with the Spanish Data Protection General Registry.
<br>
<br>FOREXSTREET also informs you that the collection and processing of personal data aims at providing you with the services offered by this website [and to send you commercial information on products or services you may be interested in] . FOREXSTREET will store these data as long as it is reasonably necessary to attain the mentioned purposes and in accordance with any applicable legal or ethical requirement. 
<br>FOREXSTREET informs you that your data will be stored in a server located in Louisville, KY 40206 (USA) and owned by MaximumASP, LLC, which has implemented the necessary security measures to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure and/or access to the above-mentioned data. By submitting  us your data you give your express consent to such international transfer of data.
<br>
<br>Consent to use information
<br>
<br>By using this website, or providing information to us in other formats, you consent to the collection and use of this information by FOREXSTREET. In addition, you are committed to supplying true, complete and accurate information and to keeping it up to date. 
<br>
<br>Mandatory and optional information
<br>
<br>In order to use our services, users may be asked to fill in a form, which requires providing certain personal information to FOREXSTREET. Unless otherwise provided in those fields expressly marked with an asterisk (*), answers to our questions on personal data are not mandatory. Not supplying the information required in such optional fields shall not represent any decrease of the services and information that we may provide you. However, failure to complete those compulsory fields or providing incorrect personal data shall prevent us from providing the requested information or services. 
<br>Rights of access, rectification, cancellation and objection
<br>
<br>FOREXSTREET informs you about the possibility of exercising your rights to access, rectificate, cancel and object to the processing of your personal data simply by making a written request to FOREXSTREET to our electronic mail address <a href="mailto:forex@fxstreet.com">forex@fxstreet.com</a>.

<br>Cookies and spamming
<br>
<br>This website does not use “cookies” to gather personal information such a person’s name or email address. A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your computer's hard drive or browser by a webpage server.
