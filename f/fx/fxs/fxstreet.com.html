We ensure that our staff and those acting on our behalf obtain, use and disclose personal information lawfully and correctly.
<br>
<br>Right of information 
<br>
<br>In compliance with the Spanish Personal Data Protection Act (“Ley Orgánica de Protección de Datos Personales”), FOREXSTREET informs you about the existence of an automated data file for which FOREXSTREET assumes sole responsibility. The referred file has been duly registered with the Spanish Data Protection General Registry.
<br>
<br>FOREXSTREET also informs you that the collection and processing of personal data aims at providing you with the services offered by this website [and to send you commercial information on products or services you may be interested in] . FOREXSTREET will store these data as long as it is reasonably necessary to attain the mentioned purposes and in accordance with any applicable legal or ethical requirement. 
<br>FOREXSTREET informs you that your data will be stored in a server located in Louisville, KY 40206 (USA) and owned by MaximumASP, LLC, which has implemented the necessary security measures to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure and/or access to the above-mentioned data. By submitting  us your data you give your express consent to such international transfer of data.
<br>
<br>Consent to use information
<br>
<br>By using this website, or providing information to us in other formats, you consent to the collection and use of this information by FOREXSTREET. In addition, you are committed to supplying true, complete and accurate information and to keeping it up to date.

				24/7 Real Media, Inc. is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users and fostering consumer confidence in the Internet, Internet advertising and direct marketing. We continue to focus on innovative ways to protect user privacy while also offering our clients the exclusive ownership and commercial use of their customer data. We invite you to review the overview of our Privacy Policy and our more detailed Privacy Policy set forth below. Because of the changing nature of privacy laws, consumer needs and our business, we may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time without notice. Accordingly, since we want to help you clearly understand our Privacy Policy, and any revisions to our Privacy Policy, we encourage you to review our Privacy Policy periodically to become aware of any changes that may have occurred. We also invite you to contact us at privacy@247realmedia.com with any questions or concerns. 
<br>
<br>While this privacy policy applies to the global operations of 24/7 Real Media, Inc., including its operations in Europe under the Real Media division and related domain names, we will refer here only to 24/7 Real Media to make reading this policy easier. The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to our site, what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit a site powered by 24/7 Real Media ad serving technology and services, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. Finally, please note that this policy applies only to 24/7 Real Media and Web sites that use 24/7 Real Media technology and services, and not to any other Web sites of other companies or organizations.
<br>
<br>1. We do not collect personal information when delivering Internet ads for our clients.
<br>Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") is information about an online consumer, such as name, address, phone number and email address that may be used to identify that consumer. As more fully described below, we do not collect PII or otherwise use PII to deliver Internet advertisements. On behalf of our clients, we do collect and use anonymous information about your Internet browser and Web surfing to better determine which ads to show you.
<br>
<br>2. (A) Our Open AdStream® Local and Central Technology: 
<br>Unlike other ad serving companies, we do not employ ad serving cookies under the 247realmedia.com domain when clients use our locally installed or centrally hosted Open AdStream technology and services. As a result, we are not in a position to offer you an option to "opt-out" of cookies employed by clients using these products and services. However, some of our clients may provide you the opportunity to opt-out of cookies delivered under their domain at their Web sites. Typically, when you see an Internet ad served by 24/7 Real Media, we have been asked by our client Web site or advertiser to act as an agent for delivery, reporting or analysis of usage statistics relating to the ad on the Web site, as well as general system monitoring or error reporting. The information we process on behalf of such client belongs to that client; we do not use that information for any other commercial purposes or for any purposes not authorized by our clients.
<br>
<br>(B) Our Insight XETM Technology: 
<br>Like our Open AdStream® technology, we do not employ ad serving cookies under the 247realmedia.com domain when clients use our Insight XE products and services. As a result, we are not in a position to offer you an option to "opt-out" of cookies employed by clients using these products and services. Typically, when you visit a Web site that uses our Insight XE technology, we have been engaged by our client Web site to act as an agent for reporting or analysis of clickstream activity relating to that Web site, as well as general system monitoring or error reporting. The information we process on behalf of such client belongs to that client; we do not use that information for any other commercial purposes or for any purposes not authorized by our clients. 
<br>
<br>(C) Our Open AdvertiserTM Technology
<br>We employ ad serving cookies under the 247realmedia.com domain when clients use our Open Advertiser technology and services. We serve a unique cookie file for each advertiser or agency that uses Open Advertiser. In the process of delivering an advertisement, promotion or email message, our Open Advertiser ad server automatically recognizes certain Non-PII that is linked to a particular browser, such as the type of Internet browser an online user is using, the type of computer operating system being used and the domain name of the Web site. Other Non-PII information collected by us, on behalf of our client, may be information related to Web sites and Web site sections a visitor is viewing when the ad is requested, location of the ISP point of presence, date and time of visit, keywords passed from another server, the number of click-throughs on an advertisement or interactions with the customer's Web site. Our client have exclusive ownership of the cookie and the information associated with it. Unlike other global ad serving companies, we do not use any of the data collected via cookies for commercial purposes not authorized by our client.
