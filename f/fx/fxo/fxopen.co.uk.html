<h2 class="headingTwo">Reasons we share your personal data</h2>
<p class="textOne">We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested or authorized (debiting and crediting your accounts, executing your trading orders, providing support to you etc.).<br>
In order to provide you with our services we share your personal data with our partners, vendors and service providers, including IT and software providers and vendors. We may also share your personal data with third persons and authorities if required by law, in respond to legal process, to protect our clients, to maintain the security of our services and to protect the rights or property of FXOpen.<br>
We do not sell, license, lease or otherwise disclose your personal data to any third party for any reason, except as described below.<br>
We reserve the right to disclose your personal data to third parties when required to do so by law to regulatory, law enforcement or other government authorities. We may also disclose your information as necessary to credit reporting or collection agencies. We may also disclose your information to non-affiliated third parties if it is necessary to protect FXOpen rights or property.<br>
We share your personal data with the banks and payment institutions, which process your payments to/from us. Commonly, we share your name, address, contact details (email) and the amount of payment to/from you. Such disclosure is made solely to provide you with an ability to deposit withdraw funds to/from us.<br>
We may share your personal data with third parties acting as our liquidity providers. Once we hedge your positions with external liquidity providers they may access the information regarding your trading orders, including types of derivatives traded, their amount.<br>
Your personal data may be shared with our software vendors and IT services providers including trading platform providers (hereinafter – “IT vendors”). While providing FXOpen with software, its modifications, implementation and support IT vendors may have an access to our information systems from their systems and locations. As a result, some of your personal data depending on the system where they are kept may be disclosed to our IT vendors. We limit an access of such IT vendors to our information systems to the best of our abilities. However, the situation may arise that in the process of software maintenance (modification of software functionality, migrating data to the new software versions, fixing bugs etc.) the vendor and/or IT provider get an access to the databases where your personal data is stored.<br>
Some of IT vendors act as our technology providers based on the software-as-a-service (SAAS) business model. In this case, FXOpen use their information systems installed on their hardware environment. Respectively, our databases may be kept on the servers of such vendors. In this case, we limit an access using integrated management rules, which restrict vendor’s access to the information kept by its clients (FXOpen).<br>
To help us improve our services to you, we may engage another business to help us to carry out certain internal functions such as account processing, client service and support, client satisfaction surveys or other data collection activities relevant to our business. We may also provide a party with customer information from our database to help us to analyze and identify customer’s needs and notify customers of product and service offerings. Use of the shared information is strictly limited to the performance of the task we request and for no other purpose.<br>
According to the applicable legislation we are required to upload your trading data (trading orders and/or positions) along with some of your personal data (name and/or UID) to the trading data depositories. We enter into agreements with the well-known international depositories, which provide a highest level of data security.<br>
We may share information with affiliates and partners, including companies operating under FXOpen ® brand name, if the information is required to provide the product or service you have requested, or to provide you with the opportunity to participate in the products or services our affiliates and&nbsp; partners offer. We may also forge partnerships and alliances, which may include joint marketing agreements, with other companies who offer high-quality products and services that might be of value to our customers. In order to ensure that these products and services meet your needs and are delivered in a manner that is useful and relevant, we may share some information with partners, affiliates and alliances. This allows them to better understand the offers that are most relevant and useful to yourself. The use of your personal information is limited to the purposes identified in our relationship with the partner or affiliate.<br>
