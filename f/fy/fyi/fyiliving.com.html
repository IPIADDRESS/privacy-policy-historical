Some advertisers use companies other than FYI  Living to serve their ads and to monitor users’ responses to ads, and  these companies (“Ad Servers”) may also collect Non-Personal Information  through the use of Cookies or Web Beacons on our Web site. In certain  situations, information collection may be facilitated by momentarily  directing your browser to the Web site of an Ad Server or other third  party acting on behalf of the sponsor, partner, or advertiser before  re-directing your browser to its selected destination (e.g., back to FYI  Living to show the ad, or to the advertiser’s website); this  re-direction process will not be apparent to you.</p><p>We do not control these third parties’ use of cookies or Web Beacons,  or how they manage the non-personal information they gather through  them. However, we do require sponsors, advertisers and Ad Servers who  collect cookie or web beacon information through our Web site to agree  that they will not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from  our site without your consent. They have promised us they will not link  any non-personal cookie or web beacon information collected by them on  our site to Personally Identifiable Information they or others collect  in other ways or from other sites except as may be described in  connection with a particular program. For example, in connection with  “Sponsored Links” furnished by Google, non-personal information sent by  your browser to Google when you click on a sponsored link or submit a  query may be used by Google as described in its privacy policy</p><p><strong>Disclosure of Your Information</strong></p><p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed  to by you, FYI Living will not disclose any Personally Identifiable or  Personal Health Information it gathers from you on our website. We may  only release Personally Identifiable or Personal Health Information to  third parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a  law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in  special cases, such as in response to a physical threat to you or  others, to protect property or defend or assert legal rights. In the  event that we are legally compelled to disclose your Personally  Identifiable or Personal Health Information to a third party, we will  attempt to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court  order. In addition, we may disclose Personal Information as described  below.</p><p><strong>A. Disclosure to FYI Living Operations and Maintenance Contractors</strong></p><p>FYI Living operations and maintenance contractors sometimes have  limited access to your Personally Identifiable Information in the course  of providing products or services to FYI Living. These contractors  include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services,  and/or content for the operation and maintenance of our Web site.  Unless you have Opted-out of receiving emails and newsletters from FYI  Living, these contractors also may have access to your email address to  send newsletters or special promotions to you on our behalf or to send  emails to you for purposes such as conducting market research on our  behalf. Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these  contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the  contractor to perform its limited function for FYI Living.</p><p><strong>B. Disclosure to Linked Sites</strong></p><p>In addition to the Third Party Contractor Web sites that you may  access as described above, for your convenience there are links to Third  Party Web sites operated by companies that are not affiliated with the  FYI Living Web site and that do not have contracts to provide content or  services through the FYI Living Web site. These links may be found in  advertisements, referenced within content, or placed beside the names or  logos of sponsors. FYI Living does not disclose your Personal  Information to these Third Party Websites without obtaining your  consent. FYI Living does not endorse and is not responsible for the  privacy practices of these sites. If you choose to link to one of these  Third Party Web sites, you should review the privacy policy posted on  this other website to understand how that Third Party Web site collects  and uses your Personally Identifiable Information.</p><p><strong>C . Disclosure of Aggregate Information</strong></p><p>FYI Living may provide Aggregate Information to third parties. For  example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of  our website and the activities they conduct while on our site. We might  also inform a pharmaceutical company (that may or may not be an  advertiser on our site) that “30% of our users live east of the  Mississippi” or that “25% of our users have tried alternative medicine.”  Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties  for this Aggregate Information. We require parties with whom we share  Aggregate Information to agree that they will not attempt to make this  information personally identifiable, such as by combining it with other  databases.<br> Effective: January 12, 2010</p><p>©2010 FYI Living, LLC.
