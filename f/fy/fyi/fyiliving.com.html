<p><strong>F. Children</strong></p>
<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. Neither FYI  Living nor any of its services are designed or intended to attract  children under the age of 13. We do not collect Personally Identifiable  Information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13.

<p><strong>G. Market Research</strong></p>
<p>From time to time the FYI Living market research department, or its  operations contractors acting on its behalf, conducts online research  surveys through email invitations, pop-up surveys and online focus  groups. When participating in a survey, we may ask you to submit  Personally Identifiable Information. FYI Living may combine your  Personally Identifiable Information you submit in a survey to  information about you from other sources. The information from other  sources may include financial, health or other identifiable information.  This Personally Identifiable Information is used for research purposes,  and is not used for sales solicitations. When a survey is sponsored by a  third party, Aggregate Information from the survey results is reported  to the sponsor. Personally Identifiable Information collected through  market research will be used only by FYI Living and its service  providers and contractors and will not be given or sold to any other  third party without your consent or as otherwise permitted by this  Privacy Policy. For market research surveys we will not knowingly accept  survey responses from or conduct interviews with any person under the  age of 18. Some surveys may provide remuneration to participants such as  a small cash fee for your time or an entry into a sweepstakes for a  larger prize. Each. In addition to collecting survey responses from our  members, Cookies may be used to authenticate respondents or to help you  pick up where you left off in a survey. If you have Cookies disabled you  may not be able to participate in some studies. Cookies may be used to  connect survey data with FYI Living site usage characteristics.</p>

Regardless of how you access the FYI  Living Health Manager the following apply:</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on FYI Living’s  Behalf</strong></p>
<p>Sponsors or advertisers on FYI Living may use their own Cookies, Web  Beacons or other online tracking technologies in the banner  advertisements served on FYI Living and in emails, special promotions or  newsletters we send you. Some advertisers use companies other than FYI  Living to serve their ads and to monitor users’ responses to ads, and  these companies (“Ad Servers”) may also collect Non-Personal Information  through the use of Cookies or Web Beacons on our Web site. In certain  situations, information collection may be facilitated by momentarily  directing your browser to the Web site of an Ad Server or other third  party acting on behalf of the sponsor, partner, or advertiser before  re-directing your browser to its selected destination (e.g., back to FYI  Living to show the ad, or to the advertiser’s website); this  re-direction process will not be apparent to you.</p>
<p>We do not control these third parties’ use of cookies or Web Beacons,  or how they manage the non-personal information they gather through  them. However, we do require sponsors, advertisers and Ad Servers who  collect cookie or web beacon information through our Web site to agree  that they will not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from  our site without your consent. They have promised us they will not link  any non-personal cookie or web beacon information collected by them on  our site to Personally Identifiable Information they or others collect  in other ways or from other sites except as may be described in  connection with a particular program. For example, in connection with  “Sponsored Links” furnished by Google, non-personal information sent by  your browser to Google when you click on a sponsored link or submit a  query may be used by Google as described in its privacy policy</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Your Information</strong></p>
<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed  to by you, FYI Living will not disclose any Personally Identifiable or  Personal Health Information it gathers from you on our website. We may  only release Personally Identifiable or Personal Health Information to  third parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a  law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in  special cases, such as in response to a physical threat to you or  others, to protect property or defend or assert legal rights. In the  event that we are legally compelled to disclose your Personally  Identifiable or Personal Health Information to a third party, we will  attempt to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court  order. In addition, we may disclose Personal Information as described  below.</p>
<p><strong>A. Disclosure to FYI Living Operations and Maintenance Contractors</strong></p>
<p>FYI Living operations and maintenance contractors sometimes have  limited access to your Personally Identifiable Information in the course  of providing products or services to FYI Living. These contractors  include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services,  and/or content for the operation and maintenance of our Web site.

Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these  contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the  contractor to perform its limited function for FYI Living.</p>
<p><strong>B. Disclosure to Linked Sites</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the Third Party Contractor Web sites that you may  access as described above, for your convenience there are links to Third  Party Web sites operated by companies that are not affiliated with the  FYI Living Web site and that do not have contracts to provide content or  services through the FYI Living Web site. These links may be found in  advertisements, referenced within content, or placed beside the names or  logos of sponsors. FYI Living does not disclose your Personal  Information to these Third Party Websites without obtaining your  consent. FYI Living does not endorse and is not responsible for the  privacy practices of these sites. If you choose to link to one of these  Third Party Web sites, you should review the privacy policy posted on  this other website to understand how that Third Party Web site collects  and uses your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p><strong>C . Disclosure of Aggregate Information</strong></p>
<p>FYI Living may provide Aggregate Information to third parties. For  example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of  our website and the activities they conduct while on our site. We might  also inform a pharmaceutical company (that may or may not be an  advertiser on our site) that “30% of our users live east of the  Mississippi” or that “25% of our users have tried alternative medicine.”  Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties  for this Aggregate Information. We require parties with whom we share  Aggregate Information to agree that they will not attempt to make this  information personally identifiable, such as by combining it with other  databases.<br>
