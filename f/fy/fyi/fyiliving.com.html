Cookies  are also used to facilitate a user’s log-in, as navigation aids and as  session timers.</p>
<p>Most browser software can be set to reject all Cookies. Most browsers  offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies in the  “Help” section of the toolbar. If you reject our Cookies, certain of  the functions and conveniences of our Web site may not work properly but  you do not have to accept our Cookies in order to productively use our  site. We do not link Non-Personal Information from Cookies to Personally  Identifiable Information without your permission and do not use Cookies  to collect or store Personal Health Information about you.</p>

<p><strong>C. Third Parties Collecting Non-Personal Information on FYI  Living’s Behalf</strong></p>
<p>Third parties under contract with FYI Living may use Cookies or Web  Beacons to collect Non-Personal Information about your usage of FYI  Living’s sites. These third parties may use this information, on our  behalf, to help FYI Living target our advertising on their sites within  their network, and FYI Living may further tailor the advertising on  these third party sites based on your geographic location (zip code),  gender and/or age range to the extent known by these third parties.  These third parties have agreed not to use Non-Personal Information they  collect from our sites except to deliver advertisements on our behalf.  If your browser is set to reject cookies, the Non-Personal Information  will not be sent to these third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information We Collect About You</strong></p>

<p><strong>B. Emails You Send to FYI Living</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to content, business information,  ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to FYI Living by email.

We also offer  online discussions moderated by medical or healthcare experts. <strong>Any  information shared (including Personally Identifiable and Personal  Health Information) that you reveal in a chat room, message board, or  online discussion is by design open to the public and is not a private,  secure service. You should think carefully before disclosing any  Personally Identifiable or Personal Health Information in any public  forum. What you have written may be seen, disclosed to or collected by  third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control  or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes. As with  any public forum on any site, this information may also appear in  third-party search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc. </strong></p>

<p>After you have registered as a member of FYI Living, you may choose  to use certain FYI Living interactive content, tools and services that  may ask you to voluntarily provide other types of information about  yourself including Personal Health Information.

<p><strong>F. Children</strong></p>
<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. Neither FYI  Living nor any of its services are designed or intended to attract  children under the age of 13. We do not collect Personally Identifiable  Information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13. A  parent or guardian, however, may use FYI Living to establish a personal  health record. The parent or guardian is solely responsible for  providing supervision of the minor’s use of FYI Living. The parent or  guardian assumes full responsibility for ensuring that the registration  information is kept secure and that the information submitted is  accurate. The parent or guardian also assumes full responsibility for  the interpretation and use of any information or suggestions provided  through FYI Living Health Manager for the minor.</p>
<p><strong>G. Market Research</strong></p>
<p>From time to time the FYI Living market research department, or its  operations contractors acting on its behalf, conducts online research  surveys through email invitations, pop-up surveys and online focus  groups. When participating in a survey, we may ask you to submit  Personally Identifiable Information. FYI Living may combine your  Personally Identifiable Information you submit in a survey to  information about you from other sources. The information from other  sources may include financial, health or other identifiable information.  This Personally Identifiable Information is used for research purposes,  and is not used for sales solicitations. When a survey is sponsored by a  third party, Aggregate Information from the survey results is reported  to the sponsor. Personally Identifiable Information collected through  market research will be used only by FYI Living and its service  providers and contractors and will not be given or sold to any other  third party without your consent or as otherwise permitted by this  Privacy Policy. For market research surveys we will not knowingly accept  survey responses from or conduct interviews with any person under the  age of 18. Some surveys may provide remuneration to participants such as  a small cash fee for your time or an entry into a sweepstakes for a  larger prize. Each. In addition to collecting survey responses from our  members, Cookies may be used to authenticate respondents or to help you  pick up where you left off in a survey. If you have Cookies disabled you  may not be able to participate in some studies. Cookies may be used to  connect survey data with FYI Living site usage characteristics.</p>
<p>FYI Living Health Manager – Registration, Use and Tools, including  Personal Health Record</p>
<p>FYI Living Health Manager allows you a secure place to store your  Personal Health Information and provides tools and services in order to  better manage your health and the health of your family. FYI Living  Health Manager requires additional registration whether you access it  through (i) FYI Living, (ii) your employer’s Web site or (iii) your  healthcare sponsor’s website. Regardless of how you access the FYI  Living Health Manager the following apply:</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on FYI Living’s  Behalf</strong></p>
<p>Sponsors or advertisers on FYI Living may use their own Cookies, Web  Beacons or other online tracking technologies in the banner  advertisements served on FYI Living and in emails, special promotions or  newsletters we send you. Some advertisers use companies other than FYI  Living to serve their ads and to monitor users’ responses to ads, and  these companies (“Ad Servers”) may also collect Non-Personal Information  through the use of Cookies or Web Beacons on our Web site. In certain  situations, information collection may be facilitated by momentarily  directing your browser to the Web site of an Ad Server or other third  party acting on behalf of the sponsor, partner, or advertiser before  re-directing your browser to its selected destination (e.g., back to FYI  Living to show the ad, or to the advertiser’s website); this  re-direction process will not be apparent to you.</p>
<p>We do not control these third parties’ use of cookies or Web Beacons,  or how they manage the non-personal information they gather through  them. However, we do require sponsors, advertisers and Ad Servers who  collect cookie or web beacon information through our Web site to agree  that they will not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from  our site without your consent. They have promised us they will not link  any non-personal cookie or web beacon information collected by them on  our site to Personally Identifiable Information they or others collect  in other ways or from other sites except as may be described in  connection with a particular program. For example, in connection with  “Sponsored Links” furnished by Google, non-personal information sent by  your browser to Google when you click on a sponsored link or submit a  query may be used by Google as described in its privacy policy</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Your Information</strong></p>
<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed  to by you, FYI Living will not disclose any Personally Identifiable or  Personal Health Information it gathers from you on our website. We may  only release Personally Identifiable or Personal Health Information to  third parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a  law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in  special cases, such as in response to a physical threat to you or  others, to protect property or defend or assert legal rights. In the  event that we are legally compelled to disclose your Personally  Identifiable or Personal Health Information to a third party, we will  attempt to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court  order. In addition, we may disclose Personal Information as described  below.</p>
<p><strong>A. Disclosure to FYI Living Operations and Maintenance Contractors</strong></p>
<p>FYI Living operations and maintenance contractors sometimes have  limited access to your Personally Identifiable Information in the course  of providing products or services to FYI Living. These contractors  include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services,  and/or content for the operation and maintenance of our Web site.  Unless you have Opted-out of receiving emails and newsletters from FYI  Living, these contractors also may have access to your email address to  send newsletters or special promotions to you on our behalf or to send  emails to you for purposes such as conducting market research on our  behalf. Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these  contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the  contractor to perform its limited function for FYI Living.</p>
<p><strong>B. Disclosure to Linked Sites</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the Third Party Contractor Web sites that you may  access as described above, for your convenience there are links to Third  Party Web sites operated by companies that are not affiliated with the  FYI Living Web site and that do not have contracts to provide content or  services through the FYI Living Web site. These links may be found in  advertisements, referenced within content, or placed beside the names or  logos of sponsors. FYI Living does not disclose your Personal  Information to these Third Party Websites without obtaining your  consent. FYI Living does not endorse and is not responsible for the  privacy practices of these sites. If you choose to link to one of these  Third Party Web sites, you should review the privacy policy posted on  this other website to understand how that Third Party Web site collects  and uses your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p><strong>C . Disclosure of Aggregate Information</strong></p>
<p>FYI Living may provide Aggregate Information to third parties. For  example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of  our website and the activities they conduct while on our site. We might  also inform a pharmaceutical company (that may or may not be an  advertiser on our site) that “30% of our users live east of the  Mississippi” or that “25% of our users have tried alternative medicine.”  Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties  for this Aggregate Information. We require parties with whom we share  Aggregate Information to agree that they will not attempt to make this  information personally identifiable, such as by combining it with other  databases.<br>
