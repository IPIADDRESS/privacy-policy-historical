            <h4>Privacy Statement</h4>
            <p>Fyvor is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our offerings. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. This Privacy Statement only covers the site Fyvor.</p>
            <p>Please Contact Us if you have any questions or comments about our privacy practices or this Privacy Policy. You can reach us via postal mail at the following address:</p>

            <h4>Aggregated Information</h4>
            <p>Aggregated information, such as which page users access or visit, and information volunteered by users is collected through various methods. For example, Fyvor collects IP addresses; an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers (the computers that "serve up" Web pages) automatically identify your computer by its IP address; when you request a page from Fyvor, our servers log your IP address.</p>
            <p>Fyvor only uses IP addresses for the purposes of Web traffic analysis and trends.</p>
            <h4>How We Collect or Create Information</h4>
            <p>Your activity on our site (such as pages viewed, searches performed and features accessed);
                <br>Operating system, web browser information, and device attributes;
                <br>Inbound-referral and outbound websites;
                <br>Your internet protocol (“IP”) address;
                <br>The dates and times that you visited or used our site, or requested certain services or transactions.</p>
            <p>Cookies and Web Beacons: A cookie is a small text file or identifier. When you visit a Site, we may store one or more cookies or other similar information on your device.</p>
            <h4>How we Use Your Information</h4>

            <h4>Third Party Cookies </h4>
            <p><b>Analytics</b>: We may allow third parties to use tracking devices through our products to collect the same type of information for the same purposes as Fyvor does for itself.

            <h4>Individuals under 13</h4>
            <p>No information should be submitted on Fyvor by users under the age of 13 years without consent of their parent or guardian. Fyvor does not provide any personally-identifying information for users under the age of 13, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever unless disclosed during collection.</p>
            <h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>
            <p>Fyvor contains links to sites other than Fyvor; those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as Fyvor.</p>
            <h4>How this Privacy Policy May Change</h4>
            <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and all changes will be effective at the time we post them. If we believe there is a significant change to this Privacy Policy or our data collection and use practices, we will indicate on our websites that our Privacy Policy has changed prior to the change becoming effective.
