		<!--p style="color:red">Well Facebook decided to kill the F.B. Purity Fan Page, with practically zero notice, at the time of execution the page had 5042 fans, and I had spent a hell of a long time building the community up. How incredibly rude of them! Now they are after this domain too, and they seem to be intent on shutting down the script... Yet another example of this *^%&amp;%^ company treating their users with contempt.</p-->
		<p>If you are like me and are sick to death of seeing messages about quiz results and other silly facebook applications, then you have come to the right place! I wrote a greasemonkey script that removes all the annoying quiz messages and other silly application spam from your facebook homepage. Leaving behind just the standard Facebook apps such as status updates, wall posts, links, notes, photos, etc.</p>

		<div id="app_content" class="inside app_content">F.B. Purity review in the Washington Post:
<blockquote><span>
Like several bazillion other users, I like using Facebook to keep tabs on what my friends are up to. What I don't like is the endless stream of "so-and-so took this quiz" and "Joe became friends with Jane" messages and "What Kind of Jedi Are You?" come-ons.
<br><br>
That's why I just became a fan of Fluff Busting Purity, a browser add-on that removes those annoying quiz and application notifications from your Facebook home page. 
<br><br>
Personally, I'm loving this add-on. Anything that cuts down Facebook clutter is a winner in my book. 
</span></blockquote> -- Rick Broida - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/26/AR2010012601996.html">Washington Post</a>
