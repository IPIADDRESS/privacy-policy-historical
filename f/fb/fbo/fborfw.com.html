        term "child" will refer to those who are under the age of 13<br>
        <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Arial">Gathering &amp; Use of Information<br>
        </font><font face="Comic Sans MS, Arial" size="2">United Media or Lynn 
        Johnston Productions Inc. does not require personal information from visitors 
        in order to gain access to any part of For Better Or For Worse; any disclosures 
        of personal data are entirely voluntary. Information that is gathered 
        online is used to improve our web siteâ€™s content. In addition, we may 
        use the information gathered to conduct internal marketing analysis to 
        improve our web site for visitors. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Arial" size="2">In some instances, users wishing 
        to receive future e-mailings (ie. newsletters, email correspondence from 
        Lynn or other staff of Lynn Johnston Productions Inc.) or enter contests 
        run on the FBorFW.com site, will be asked to provide personal information 
        on-line. Below are the different areas where visitors may opt to provide 
        personal information, and how we handle the collected information:</font></p>
      <p><font color="#330099" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS, Arial"><b><font color="#000099">e-mail 
        correspondence:</font></b></font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS, Arial"> 
        any personal information (e-mail info, name) collected for the purpose 
        of e-mail correspondence with Lynn Johnston Productions Inc. is only used 
        internally, and is deleted upon reply to the correspondence.<br>
        <font color="#000099"><b>newsletter mailing list:</b></font> any personal 
        information collected for the purpose of distributing the FBorFW newsletter 
        is only used internally. This information is not shared with any third 
        parties, and is stored where access is restriced to Lynn Johnston Productions 
        Inc. staff only. Any subscribers to our mailing lists can request to have 
        themselves removed from the list at any time, and their personal information 
        will be permanantly deleted from our database records. Children under 
        13 are required to provide a parent or guardian's e-mail contact information, 
        and we will contact the parent or guardian by e-mail before we will add 
        any children under 13 to our mailing lists, requiring the parent or guardian 
        give us written consent for that child to be added to our mailing list.<br>
        <font color="#000099"><b>contests:</b></font> any personal information 
        collected for the purpose of tracking contest entries on the FBorFW.com 
        website is only used internally, and upon completion of contest, all personal 
        information involved with the contest entries are deleted. Children under 
        13 years of age are required to provide a parent or guardian's e-mail 
        contact information, and we will contact the parent or guardian by e-mail 
        before we will allow any children under 13 to enter a contest, giving 
        the parent or guardian the chance to stop a child from entering the contest. 
        No mailing address information will be requested unless entry is selected 
        as a "winner" of a contest. Before any child under the age of 
        13 can provide mailing address information, we will require a signed Parental 
        Consent Form, which we will supply. No personal information that is not 
        required to properly run the contest will be collected from entrants.<br>
        <font color="#000099"><b>purchasing merchandise:</b></font> any personal 
        information collected for the purpose of completing an electronic purchase 
        through the FBorFW.com merchandise section is only used internally, and 
        will be transmitted using an encrypted code to thwart anyone trying to 
        intercept the information provided. All personal information collected 
        for the purpose of completing an electronic purchase is stored in an area 
        to which the general public does not have access.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Arial">Information Tracking <br>
        <font size="2">United Media uses an outside service to track the total 
        number of visitors to each area of For Better Or For Worse. Compiled in 
        an aggregate form, this information shows us which areas visitors enjoy 
        most, and allows us to update and improve site content. Personally identifiable 
        information is not extracted in this process.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Arial">Engage Media<br>
        <font size="2">This site, For Better or For Worse, uses the services of 
        Engage for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions and other marketing 
        messages. To do this, Engage collects anonymous data through the use of 
        cookies. To learn more about Engage, including your ability to opt out

        you see on the site. The advertisements help us bring you the For Better

        the quality of your visit to the For Better Or For Worse site. "Cookies" 
        are a form of software technology used to collect non-personal information

        Explorer 4.0), type of operating system (i.e. Windows 95, Macintosh) and 
        the domain of the visitor's Internet service provider. DoubleClick uses 
        cookies to make sure that you do not see the same advertisements repeatedly 
        and when possible, shows advertising that is relevant to you based on 
        what you have seen previously. Cookies are anonymous. DoubleClick does 
        not know the name, e-mail address, phone number, or home address of anybody 
        who visits the For Better Or For Worse site or any other site in the DoubleClick
