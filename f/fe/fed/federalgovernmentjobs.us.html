        <h2>This document discloses the privacy practices and terms and conditions of use for the federalgovernmentjobs.us website and related internet services ("We" / "Us" / "Our services"). </h2>
        <br>
       <ul>
       <li><strong>We are NOT an agency of any government entity.</strong> <br></li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       <li><strong>We do not collect personally identifiable information from children. </strong>Our services are intended solely for people near or already of workforce age.</li>
       </ul>
         <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        We deeply values the privacy of the users of our services. As such, we collect, transmit, and store minimal amounts of your information necessary for the operation of our services and necessary to present advertising and voluntary user surveys and other content features. Below this section is a statement regarding information about you that we may collect, transmit, or store in providing services to you. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Further we require that all users of our services meet certain conditions and abide by the terms of use agreement. <em><strong>Continued use of our services constitutes acceptance of the Terms and Conditions of Use Policy below.</strong></em>
        <br>
        <br>
        Finally, additional information about us, our intellectual property claims, contact information and other essential information is also provided below. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Types of information we collect about you</h4>
        Users necessarily provide certain <strong>"network" information</strong> in 
        accessing our services. This information may include web pages accessed, date and time of access, your network provider and address (IP address), referring web page (web page containing the link that brought you to our website), system information (operating system and web browser version), etc. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Users are cautioned that this information sometimes implies additional information</strong> (e.g. the user's employer may be implied by accessing services from an employer's network, likewise cellphone carrier if accessed using mobile devices). 
        <br>
        <br>
        Generally, your "network" information is used only to provide our services to you, to troubleshoot technical problems with our systems and to analyze aggregate usage statistics. We do not provide your individual level network information to others except when necessary to troubleshoot technical problems. Certain "on page" features such as analytics tracking, advertising, and voluntary user surveys are provided by third-party companies with whom we have an 
        established business partnership. These companies will generally receive similar network information described above. We evaluate all such partners for reasonableness of their privacy practices as well as conformance with standard industry practices. However, we cannot be liable for these companies secondary use of your information. For instance, advertising providers may be aware of previous websites that you have visited and present advertising within our pages based on that knowledge or may use knowledge of your use of our website in later advertising on our or other internet sites. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Users are asked to voluntarily provide certain <strong>"user" information</strong> when using some of our features. For instance, users who create custom searches provide their search criteria to us and users of our email notification services provide their email address as well. We treat your information as confidential and use your information only to provide our services to you, to troubleshoot technical problems 
        with our systems and to analyze aggregate usage statistics. We will use reasonable means to encrypt and secure your information that is stored within our systems. 
        <br>
        <br>
        When your "user" information is provided within third-party "on page" features (e.g. the user supplies information within an advertisement or voluntary user survey) that information is provided to the third-party directly and is neither stored nor secured by us and we cannot be liable for the further use of the information. We will make reasonable efforts to label and visually separate third-party "on page" features with the exception of analytics tracking. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Cookies:</strong> federalgovernmentjobs.us and third-party advertising and voluntary survey providers use cookies to store small amounts of text information on your computer. Such information is commonly resent upon subsequent web page requests to maintain awareness of your session and your user preferences. Generally, storing and sending of cookies is regulated by your software 
        applications.
        <br>
        <br>

Such coding is generally limited to interacting with the display of a webpage, sending or receiving updated information from our servers, or sending the web browser to a new address.
