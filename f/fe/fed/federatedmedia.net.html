<div class="bold-type">FM Publishing Privacy Policy</div>

<em>This Privacy Policy is effective as of November 1, 2009.</em><br>

<p>At Federated Media Publishing ("FM"), we represent online publishers and their properties ("Publisher Properties") to advertisers and support other properties sponsored by advertiser clients ("Client-Sponsored Properties") as well as operate websites on federatedmedia.net (the "FM Domain") (each a "Site" together our "Sites").  Because we understand the importance of your privacy, we take safeguarding your personal information very seriously. We are providing the following Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of the personally identifiable information collected from you during your use of any site FM may represent or support.
</p>

<p>
Note that this Policy does not cover information collected, used or disclosed by Publisher Properties directly or by commercial partners with which those properties work directly without FM's involvement.
</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us at

<em>Information Collection</em><br>

<p>Information is collected in connection with our Sites and Services in the following circumstances, though not every one of our Sites offers each of these four: (i) registering for an account, (ii) participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, and promotions ("Contests, Surveys and Promotions"), (iii) contacting FM, and (iv) visiting and browsing any of our Sites. 
</p>
<em>Registration</em><br>
<p>Many of our Sites require registration to access certain site features.  Information collected during the registration process may include your name, company name, company address, phone number, username, email address, date of birth, account password. We may also collect your IP address when you register and use our Sites.  From time to time in the future we may offer additional features, services, and promotional opportunities that may require you to submit additional information to participate. 
</p>
<em>Contests, Surveys, and Promotions</em><br>
<p>We also collect certain information about you and your web browsing sessions if you participate in Contests, Surveys and/or Promotions.  Participation in Contests, Surveys or Promotions is always optional. Should you choose to participate, the information we collect may include your name, phone number, address, e-mail address, IP address, website from whence you came to the applicable Site, travel preferences, favorite websites, family profile, age, whether you are a U.S. resident, and employment profile.  
</p>
<em>Contacting FM</em><br>
<p>You may contact or provide feedback to FM by filling out and submitting a form through a site on the FM Domain.  When you contact FM through a site, your full name and email address are transmitted to FM. Any other information you choose to include in the form you submit would also be transferred to and stored on FM's servers. 
</p>
<em>Anonymous Information</em><br>
<p>We call information you provide that can be used to locate or identify you "Personally Identifiable Information."  We collect Personally Identifiable Information in the ways we describe above.
</p>

<p>
FM also collects anonymous information, such as traffic statistics and general usage patterns regarding page views, dates and times you use the Sites, the website that referred you to the Sites, and the method by which you accessed the Sites, files accessed through the Sites, responses sent to the browser, the length of data sent to the browser, and other data used in the communication between browser and Sites ("Anonymous Information").  Note that in some cases, FM may use or enable the use of "cookies", "web beacons" (also known as image tags, GIF or web bugs), "embedded scripts" and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, "Tracking Technologies") to collect Anonymous Information automatically as you browse our Sites and the wider Internet.  These practices are described below.
</p>

<em>Use of Tracking Technologies and Targeting Services</em><br>

<p>FM may use Tracking Technologies to collect "click stream" data and additional anonymous information regarding user visits to Sites, such as visits to Sites' web pages, use of Sites' features, and purchasing history or preferences and may also collect IP addresses or some other identifier unique to the device employed by the user (e.g. computer, mobile device, etc.) to access the Site ("Identifier"). The Identifier is automatically assigned to the device by which the user accesses the Site.
</p>
<p>FM may enter into commercial agreements with advertisers, advertising networks, advertisement or user data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, "Third Party Advertisers") to, for example, serve advertisements on the Site, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Sites ("Targeting Services").  In some cases, Tracking Technologies are employed in the use of these Targeting Services.
</p>
<p>
Although these Third Party Advertisers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by FM or the Publisher Properties, the Third Party Advertisers may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on user devices if users choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in their browsers and/or they may otherwise have access to anonymous information about users.
</p>
<p>
In any case, Personally Identifiable Information is not collected as part of the use of either Tracking Technologies or Targeting Services by FM or Third Party Advertisers.
</p>
<p>
Should you wish to decline to allow the use Targeting Services by some Third Party Advertising Service Providers, the Network Advertising Initiative offers a web form by which web users can opt-out of user data collection activities by its member ad networks.  This form can be found here:  <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note, however, that FM will not guarantee the availability, performance or functionality of the NAI Opt-Out Tool nor will FM guarantee that it will limit its commercial partnerships to NAI member networks and service providers.
</p>
<em>How We Use the Information we Collect</em><br>
<p>
We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide our Services and to communicate with you regarding such Services. We may also use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide information you have requested or products you have purchased (e.g., membership updates, e-mail newsletters, advertising insertion orders), to notify winners of Contests, to resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems. We also may use your Personally Identifiable Information: to respond to specific inquiries made by you; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; and to customize, measure, and improve our services, content, and layout.
</p>
<p>
In addition, FM may analyze and use your Personally Identifiable Information — and supplement it with other information we obtain — to notify you and target advertising that we think may be of interest to you, and to measure the advertising effectiveness of advertisements on our Sites and Publisher Properties.
</p>
<p>
We use your Anonymous Information for the purposes of system administration, maintaining Site and system security, providing certain site functionality and content, targeting advertising, Site tracking, and collecting and reporting aggregate usage information. We may combine Anonymous Information with your personally identifiable information to notify you of special offers and target advertising and other content to you. 
</p>

<em>Phishing</em><br>
<p>We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your username, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to FM. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is our top priority. For more information about phishing and Internet privacy and security, you may want to visit the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/tech/privacy.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/tech/privacy.shtm</a>.</p>
  
<em>Information Sharing</em><br>

<p>Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with any third parties.</p>

<em>Posting</em><br>
<p>Any information voluntarily disclosed by users and posted on our site (on message boards, web logs, and/or in chat areas) may be viewed and used by others. If you post personal information that is accessible to the public online, you do so at your own risk. Be aware that you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 
Third Party Service Providers</p>
<p>We engage certain trusted third parties to perform various functions and provide services to us (for example, web hosting services and maintenance services). These providers may have access to some of your Personally Identifiable Information, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

<em>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</em><br>
<p>We may choose to disclose some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information to the government, law enforcement officials, or private parties if we, in our sole discretion, believe it necessary or appropriate to comply with the law, to respond to legal complaints, to comply with legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the rights of FM or a third party, to ensure the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally questionable activity.
</p>
<em>Changes in Corporate Ownership</em><br>
<p>If any or all of the assets of FM are acquired by, or merged with, another entity we will share some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information with that entity.   
</p>
<em>Accessing and Changing Your Information</em><br>

<p>You may always access and modify certain of your Personally Identifiable Information you provide through FM's self-service e-commerce platform by visiting the "sign in" area at the FM Domain. You may or may not be able to modify the Personally Identifiable Information you provide through other parts of the FM Domain or other Sites. If this causes concern, please contact us at the e-mail address provided below and we will provide information for the specific Site you reference. 
</p>

<em>Security</em><br>

<p>We place great importance on the safety and security of your Personally Identifiable Information. We employ certain physical, procedural, and technological measures in an attempt to protect your Personally Identifiable Information from unauthorized access and use. FM's servers that contain Personally Identifiable Information are stored in an off-site facility. FM also uses hashed passwords, which allows an algorithmic version of your password to be stored instead of you actual password. When receiving financial information (e.g., credit card numbers or PayPal account IDs) for completing certain online transactions, including those in connection with the FM self-service platform (http://advertisers.federatedmedia.net.), our site uses SSL or "Secure Sockets Layer," an industry standard security protocol, though other communications through the Sites are not encrypted. Although we do attempt to keep your Personally Identifiable Information secure, no security measures are perfect; there is always a possibility that a security breach could occur, resulting in the release of Personally Identifiable Information. 
</p>
<em>Links to Other Sites</em><br>

<p>Sites may contain links to other websites, including but not limited to Publisher Properties, in several places. You should pay particular attention to which website you are visiting when submitting any personally identifiable information to these websites. This Privacy Policy addresses the use and disclosure of only that information that is collected from you through our various Sites. Different rules may apply to information you submit to other websites and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of those websites. 
</p>
<em>Our Policy Toward Children</em><br>

<p>None of our Sites are directed toward persons under eighteen years of age. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us at
