        <h3>Other players and users.</h3>

        <h3>International data transfers</h3>

        <h3>Cookies and similar technologies</h3>
        <p>Like most online services, we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to provide and personalize the Service, analyse use, target advertisements and prevent fraud. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but some parts of the Service may then not function properly.</p>

        <h4>Data retention.</h4>
        <p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Service.&nbsp;We will for example periodically de-identify unused game accounts and we regularly review and de-identify unnecessary data.<br>
          Note that if you ask us to remove your personal data, we will retain your data as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
        <h3>Age limits</h3>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data about or direct or target interest based advertising to anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to use our Services.&nbsp; If you are under 13, please do not send any data about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.&nbsp; No one under the age of 13 may provide any personal data.&nbsp; If we learn that we have collected personal data about a child under age 13, we will delete that data as quickly as possible.&nbsp; If you believe that we might have any data from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us.</p>
