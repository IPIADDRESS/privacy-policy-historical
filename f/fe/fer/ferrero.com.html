Purposes of processing and legal grounds<br><br><strong>Ferrero </strong>intends to use your Personal Data, collected through the <strong>Website</strong>, for the following purposes:<br><br>•	To provide answers or services you request, including allowing the creation of an account, to receive information from <strong>Ferrero </strong>and sending you alerts by means of push notifications; to verify your identity and assist you, in case you lose or forget your login/password details for any of <strong>Ferrero</strong>’s registration services; to allow you to create and maintain a registered user profile, to process transactions and enrolments you request, to contact you when necessary and respond to your requests and enquiries, including emails; to process card payments and to provide any other services which you may request; to send you newsletters you have subscribed to as a service (containing only informative content); to finalize purchase orders and deliver products bought on the <strong>Website </strong>and to provide any other services which you may request (“<strong>Service Provision</strong>”). <br>No consent is required for the processing of data for the purposes since such processing is necessary to provide the services requested and, therefore, for the performance of an agreement to which you are a party or for the implementation of measures requested by you prior to entering into an agreement (GDPR art. 6,1b). It is not mandatory for you to give <strong>Ferrero </strong>your Personal Data for these purposes; however, if you do not, <strong>Ferrero </strong>will not be able to provide any services to you. <br>•	For marketing, promotional and publicity purposes, including to carry out direct marketing, as well as to carry out studies, research, market statistics or surveys, via e-mail, SMS, push notifications, pop-up banners, instant messaging, phone calls by an operator, <strong>Ferrero</strong>’s official social media pages, regarding <strong>Ferrero</strong>’s products and services (“<strong>Marketing</strong>”), and to send you offers, promotions or other information about our goods and services. Processing for these purposes is based on your consent. It is never mandatory for you to give consent to Ferrero for the use of your Personal Data for these purpose, and you will suffer no consequence if you choose not to give it (aside from not being able to receive further marketing communications from <strong>Ferrero</strong>). Any consent given may also be withdrawn at a later stage. <br>•	For future marketing, promotional and publicity purposes, by sending you direct e-mail marketing communication regarding products and services provided by <strong>Ferrero </strong>which are identical or similar to those you have previously requested through the use of the <strong>Website </strong>(“<strong>Soft Spam</strong>”). Processing for these purposes is based on <strong>Ferrero</strong>’s legitimate interest in sending you direct e-mail marketing communication regarding products and services provided by Ferrero and which are identical or similar to those you have previously purchased through the <strong>Website</strong>. You can block these communications, and you will suffer no consequence if you do so (aside from not being able to receive further communications from <strong>Ferrero</strong>), by objecting through the unsubscribe link provided at the bottom of all such communications.<br>•	To create your user profile (individual and/or aggregate profiles) on our <strong>Website</strong>, by collecting and analyzing information on the preferences you select and choices you make on the <strong>Website </strong>as well as on your general activities on the <strong>Website</strong>, through the use of profiling cookies (“<strong>Profiling</strong>”). This information will be used to personalize the Services provided through the <strong>Website</strong>, where possible, to suit your preferences and choices, as well as to serve you with information and advertisements which may be relevant to you and your interests, to propose customized offers that may be of your interest, to give you information about other websites/services which <strong>Ferrero </strong>believes you may be interested in. All algorithms involved in this processing are regularly tested, to ensure the processing’s fairness and control for bias.  Processing for this purpose is based on your consent, collected by means of the cookie pop-up banner and/or a specific tick box. It is never mandatory for you to give consent to <strong>Ferrero </strong>for use of your Personal Data for this purpose, and you will suffer no consequence if you choose not to (aside from not being able to benefit from greater personalization of your user experience regarding the <strong>Website</strong>). Any consent given may also be withdrawn at a later stage, either by modifying your device settings or contacting <strong>Ferrero </strong>at the address mentioned above. <br>•	For compliance with laws which impose upon <strong>Ferrero </strong>the collection and/or further processing of certain kinds of Personal Data, including regulations on contests in case users participate to contests or prizes on our <strong>Website </strong>(“<strong>Compliance</strong>”). When you provide any Personal Data to Ferrero, <strong>Ferrero </strong>must process it in accordance with the applicable laws, which may include retaining and reporting your Personal Data to official authorities for compliance with tax, customs or other legal obligations. No consent is required for the processing of data for this purpose since such processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation (GDPR, art. 6, 1a).<br>•	To prevent and detect any misuse of the <strong>Website</strong>, or any fraudulent activities carried out through the <strong>Website </strong>(“<strong>Misuse/Fraud</strong>”). Processing for this purpose is necessary to pursue Ferrero’s legitimate interests in preventing and detecting fraudulent activities or misuse of the <strong>Website </strong>(for potentially criminal purposes).<br>•	To analyze and improve our service provision, enhance the <strong>Website</strong>, evaluate the effectiveness of Ferrero’s marketing activities and services, perform statistical and demographics analyses on <strong>Ferrero</strong>’s corporate clients and registered users (“<strong>Analytics</strong>”). <br>Processing for this purpose is necessary to pursue <strong>Ferrero</strong>’s legitimate interests in the development and administration of the <strong>Website </strong>and to improve the services provided on the <strong>Website</strong>.<br><br>Users shall not be required to provide Personal Data to browse public pages of the <strong>Website</strong>. The provision of Personal Data for the purposes mentioned above is optional, however, failure to provide required data (indicated as such in the registration form, as applicable) may prevent users from completing registration or availing of related services. <br><br><strong> Who will be able to access your Personal Data?</strong><br><br>In the framework of its activity and for the purposes specified above, your Personal Data may be shared with the following entities (“Recipients”):<br><br>•	Other companies within the <strong>Ferrero </strong>Group for internal administrative purposes; and<br>•	Duly appointed data processors, providing specific processing or accessory services (e.g.  storing data, sending out messages for us, web hosting, contests’ management, consumer service, IT services regarding the <strong>Website </strong>operation, emailing) on Ferrero’s behalf and under its instructions, whose data protection maturity has been checked by Ferrero before entering into the required data processing agreement. The full updated list of appointed as data processors, which may include other companies within the <strong>Ferrero </strong>Group, is available from our data protection officer;<br>•	Selected individuals authorized by <strong>Ferrero </strong>to process Personal Data needed to carry out activities strictly related to the provision of the services through the Website (e.g. technical maintenance of network equipment and electronic communications networks), who have undertaken an obligation of confidentiality or are subject to an appropriate legal obligation of confidentiality (e.g., employees of Ferrero);<br>•	Public entities, bodies or authorities, in accordance with the applicable law or binding orders of those entities, bodies or authorities. We may also disclose your Personal Data when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.<br><br>Personal data shall not be disclosed nor transferred to third parties, except in the event of extraordinary corporate transactions, when Personal Data may be assigned or contributed to third party purchasers/lessees or assigns.  <br><br><strong> Data Transfer<br></strong><br>Personal Data may be transferred to other countries of the European Union where the premises or the servers of Ferrero or of any of its suppliers are located. <br>Personal Data shall not be transferred outside the territory of the European Union. <br><br><strong>Children</strong><br><br>In order to comply with laws protecting children’s online privacy, Ferrero does not knowingly collect any Personal Data from children under 16. <strong>Ferrero </strong>takes children’s privacy seriously. As such, we would recommend that a parent or guardian assist and guide any children under 16 which may intend to browse the <strong>Website </strong>or access the services provided by <strong>Ferrero</strong>. Children under age 16 should not use <strong>Ferrero</strong>’s Website or services. In the event that <strong>Ferrero </strong>learns that it has inadvertently collected Personal Data from a child under the age of 16, Ferrero will promptly delete such information.<br><br>If parents/guardians would like to prevent a minor from accessing the <strong>Website</strong>, programs are easily available which enable control over access to the Internet or specific websites.<br><br><strong> Security of Personal Data</strong><br><br>All Personal Data collected and processed through the <strong>Website </strong>will be stored and processed so as to minimize the risk of destruction, loss (including accidental loss), unauthorized access / use or incompatible use with the initial purpose of collection.
