<br>
This privacy policy applies to all personal information collected by Catch via the internet.<br>
<br>
Catch
recognises the importance of your privacy, and that you have a right to
control how your personal information is collected and used.&nbsp; We know
that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that
seriously.&nbsp; Unless you directly give us consent to do otherwise, Catch
will only collect and use your personal information as set out below.<br>
<br>
<span class="title_2small">Collection of information</span><br>
<br>
The four main ways we collect personal information about you are:<br>
<ul><li>when information about you is posted on a Catch website, either by you or by a third party; </li><li>when you log into a Catch website or otherwise submit personal information to Catch; </li><li>when
you use a Catch website, in which case our system automatically
collects information relating to your visit to that website, such as
your IP address; and</li><li>through the operation of CatchBot, Catch's web crawler (described in more detail below).</li></ul>
<span class="title_2small">Our use of cookies</span><br>
<br>
Cookies
are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's
hard disk for record keeping purposes.&nbsp; Most web browsers are set to
accept cookies.&nbsp; Catch uses cookies to make your use of our website and
services as convenient as possible.&nbsp; Cookies in and of themselves do
not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's
browser.&nbsp; Cookies are useful to estimate our number of users and
determine overall traffic patterns through our website.<br>
<br>
If you
do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse
cookies.&nbsp; This may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of
Catch's services.<br>
<br>
<span class="title_2small">Using and disclosing your personal information</span><br>
<br>
Our purpose in collecting information about you is to: <br>
<ul><li>provide you with a better service experience with content and advertising that is more relevant to your interests; and</li><li>reate
a business information database for use as part of Catch's online
business.&nbsp; Whilst Catch's business information database is designed to
operate as a business directory (not a directory of individuals) it is
possible that personal information may become included in the business
information database.</li></ul>
Catch will not use or disclose any information about you without your consent, unless:<br>
<ul><li>the use or disclosure is for one of the purposes described above or otherwise permitted by this policy;</li><li>it is required or permitted by law (including by relevant privacy laws);</li><li>we believe it necessary to provide you with a service which you have requested;</li><li>to protect the rights, property or personal safety of another Catch website user, any member of the public or Catch; or</li><li>any of the assets and/or operations of Catch are being transferred to another party.</li></ul>
If
you do not provide requested information, Catch may not be able to
provide you with access to or full use of sections of the Catch website.<br>
<br>
<span class="title_2small">Disclosing information</span><br>
<br>
Sometimes,
the activities described above require us to share your personal
information with other organisations.&nbsp; The types of situations in which
Catch usually discloses personal information, and the types of
organisations to which such disclosure is usually made, include the
following:<br>
<ul><li>The business information database is available
via the internet to any member of the public.&nbsp; It is also disclosed in
its entirety to Catch's related entities and to other entities with
whom Catch has a business relationship, as part of Catch's online
business.</li><li>Catch discloses personal information to its service
providers, advisers and other entities with whom Catch has a business
relationship, in the course of operating the Catch websites and Catch
online business and in the course of delivering the Catch services.</li></ul>
<span class="title_2small">Marketing</span><br>
<br>
In
seeking to give you the most worthwhile experience of our websites
possible, Catch may use your personal information to send you
information and product updates about Catch websites and services or to
permit other parties to send other information about products or
services which may be of interest to you.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We may contact you at any email or other address or contact point which we have collected or obtained in order to:<br>
<ul><li>contact you about your business listing on a Catch website;</li><li>provide you with updated information about Catch websites; or</li><li>provide you with other information about other products or services which you may enjoy.</li></ul>

<br>
You can request access to the personal information we hold about you by making a request to the Catch Privacy Officer via <a href="mailto:legal@catch.com.au">legal@catch.com.au</a>. We will provide you with access unless we are legally authorised not to do so.<br>
<br>
<span class="title_2small">Changing and deleting the information we have about you</span><br>
<br>
If
at any time you wish to change personal information that is inaccurate
or out of date, please contact us by emailing our Catch Privacy Officer

If you wish to have your personal information deleted, please let us know in the same manner as referred to above.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We
will take all reasonable steps to change or delete information in
response to such a request.&nbsp; If there is a reason that we cannot make
that change or deletion, we will inform you of that reason.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span class="title_2small">Storage and security of your personal information</span><br>
<br>
Catch
will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep secure any
information which we hold about you, and to keep this information
accurate and up to date.&nbsp; You should note that the internet is not a
secure method of transmitting information and, as such, we are not
responsible for the security of any information sent or received over
the internet.<br>
<br>
Please note that Catch may use overseas facilities
to store, process or back up its information.&nbsp; As a result, we may
transfer your personal information to our overseas facilities.&nbsp;
However, this does not change our commitment to keep your information
secure.<br>
<br>
<span class="title_2small">Third party websites</span><br>
<br>
Catch
websites contain links to websites that are not operated by Catch and
the contact details for many businesses not operated by Catch.&nbsp; These
linked sites and listed businesses are not under the control of Catch,
and we are not responsible for the conduct of those businesses.&nbsp; Before
disclosing your personal information on any other website or to any
other company, we advise you to examine the Terms and Conditions /
Privacy Policy of those organisations. <br>
<br>
<span class="title_2small">CatchBot</span><br>
<br>
CatchBot
