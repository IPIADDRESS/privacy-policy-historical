, an official website of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBSA). BCBSA's privacy policies may differ at its other websites or in its off-line data collection and reporting practices. Questions regarding the privacy policy of your independent, local Blue Cross and Blue Shield company should be directed to that company.</p><p>Each of our business partners, including CVS Caremark (Pharmacy), WebMD Health Services (Health Tools), the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), our enrollment area (the FEP Operations Center for Customer eService), AXA Assistance for overseas benefits and provider information, and any other supplemental plan vendor, have separate privacy policies.</p><p><strong>The information we collect:</strong></p><p>Our web servers automatically capture your domain name, the IP address of the web page from which you enter our site, the pages you visit on our site and the amount of time you spend here. We do not collect any information that can reveal your personal identity unless you voluntarily provide it when you register to use interactive features of the site or to receive information from us or Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies. We do not collect and save any Protected Health Information (PHI). Any section of www.fepblue.org that is directed to children or teens will be protected by a screening mechanism to help ensure parental consent is obtained before we collect or use PII from children under 13. We do not knowingly collect or use PII from children under 13 without the consent of a parent or guardian.</p><p>PII voluntarily provided by you may be retained indefinitely for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>If you use the features on this website or on the websites of our business partners, you are "opting in" and agree to our collection of information as described above. You can "opt out" or prevent us from collecting PHI or PII by not using the interactive features of this website or the websites of our business partners. You may "opt in" or "opt out" each time you access the website. If you "opt out," you cannot use the interactive features, such as the Provider Directory, BlueNews, and Pharmacy Programs.</p><p><strong>Use of the information this website gathers/tracks:</strong></p><p>The non-PII we gather and store in aggregate form is only used to maintain or improve our website, and we may share that information with other areas in BCBSA, local Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies, our business partners, or with companies we hire to help us maintain or improve the website.</p><p>Any PII you voluntarily give us will be stored in a secure environment and used only to provide the product, service, or information you have requested or for which you registered. Unless you specifically consent to let us do so, your PII, including your e-mail address, will not be sold, rented, licensed or otherwise shared with third parties, other than Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies or business partners as required to fulfill a request from you. Personal information you voluntarily provide and the non-PII we collect in aggregate form will not affect your insurance coverage, eligibility, premiums or claims payment by any Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan company.</p><p><strong>Cookies and spyware:</strong></p><p>When you visit our website, we may place a "session" or cookie on your computer that will allow us to customize and enhance your experience at www.fepblue.org, make improvements to our website, or to report site activity. Our session cookies will not permanently store on your computer and expire when you leave our website. Our cookies will never be used to track your activity on any third party websites or to send spam, nor will our cookies provide us with any PII about you.</p><p>We will store cookie information only in aggregate form and only use the information to make improvements to the website or internal reports on site activity. You can use your browser controls to refuse to allow any cookies to be placed on your computer.</p><p>Spyware is software that helps gather information about a person or organization without their knowledge, and which may send information to another entity without your consent, or asserts control over a computer without your knowledge.</p><p>At this time, we do not use spyware on our site. Cookies are used to store <a href="/index.jsp" title="FEPBlue.org Home" xmlns:tridion="http://www.tridion.com/ContentManager/5.0">fepblue.org</a>
 browsing history in order to improve the experience on the website. The browsing history is stored anonymously and it is not transmitted to or readable by other websites but <a href="/index.jsp" title="FEPBlue.org Home" xmlns:tridion="http://www.tridion.com/ContentManager/5.0">fepblue.org</a>
.</p><p><strong>Sites we link to:</strong></p><p>If you choose to use any of the links we provide to our member companies, sponsors, and other third party resources, you will be leaving our website and going to a new website. Protection of your privacy at those other websites will be governed by the privacy policy at that website. Please take the time to read the privacy policies at their websites. We have business relationships with the local Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies, CVS Caremark, WebMD Health Services, OPM, AXA Assistance, supplemental benefit companies, and the FEP Operations Center. These linking relationships are not a form of advertising or promotion, but part of the unique set of benefits available under the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. The links to other websites within our website are not of an advertising or promotional nature.</p><p><strong>Changes to this policy:</strong></p><p>If we make any significant changes to this policy, we will let you know the effective date of the changes and provide a tool for you to understand what has changed.</p><ul><li>Policy updated 8/2010 – cookies are now used on the site. See "Cookies and Spyware" section for details.</li></ul><p>Includes changes and clarifications to our Mail Service Pharmacy Benefits manager.</p><p><strong>Glossary of Terms:</strong></p><p><strong>Aggregate Information or Data:</strong></p><p>A website may gather individual pieces of non-personal information from the individuals who use the website. The website may combine similar data from many or all of the users of the website into one data category. For example, all of the users who accessed the Pharmacy Programs feature on our website. The combined data or aggregate data does not identify each user, but provides the total number of times the Pharmacy Programs was accessed from www.fepblue.org during a specific time period.</p><p>On <a href="/index.jsp" title="FEPBlue.org Home" xmlns:tridion="http://www.tridion.com/ContentManager/5.0">www.fepblue.org</a>
, we collect aggregate data to monitor what features are accessed on our website and monitor what features are most useful to our members.</p><p><strong>Cookie:</strong></p><p>A cookie is a small data file that is stored on the hard drive of the computer you use to view a website. Normally, cookies are used by the website owner or advertisers on the website to help make the website easier to use or track usage on that website or other websites where the advertiser may have a presence as well. For example, if a password and user ID are needed to sign into a website and there is a box for you to check to store your password for future use, your password is stored in a cookie on your computer.</p><p><strong>Non-Personal Information:</strong></p><p>This is information that cannot be traced back to any individual user and cannot be used to identify the individual user.</p><p><strong>Opt-In:</strong></p><p>If you "opt-in," it means that you are actively indicating your selection of a feature on this website. Usually, it also means you must provide certain information, such as your zip code, ID number, address, or e-mail address to use the selected feature. For example, if you use our online Provider Directory to locate a provider near where you live, you must enter at least your zip code to use this feature. Another example: if you subscribe to BlueNews, you must enter your e-mail address to receive updates and e-newsletters from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan by e-mail. When you use an interactive feature and enter personal information, you are opting-in for that feature.</p><p><strong>Opt-Out:</strong></p><p>If you "opt-out," it means that you have to take some action to avoid the collection of any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PII). To "opt-out" on our website, you are choosing not to use any interactive feature or feature that allows us to collect PII or PHI. For example, when you opt-out, you cannot use our Provider Directory, Pharmacy Programs or other features that ask you to enter information.</p><p><strong>Personal Health Information (PHI):</strong></p><p>When your Personally Identifiable information (PII) is combined with your known health conditions, the information becomes Personal Health Information.</p><p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information (PII):</strong></p><p>This is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and Social Security Number.</p>
