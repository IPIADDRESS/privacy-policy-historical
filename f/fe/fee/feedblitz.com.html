<p>You have the right to control your personal information.  
</p><p>We also want to present information to you that is tailored your needs. For this reason, we ask you to register or to provide personal information when you visit certain areas of the site, or subscribe to a mailing list or blog feed. We use the personal information you share with us to ensure the content and services that we provide are tailored to your current and future needs. We may also track your activity (the pages you visit) on our web site using cookies in order for us to improve the Internet presence. No information about your subscriptions, activities or any personally identifiable information we collect is shared outside the company, with the exception of the owners of the feeds you subscribe to (see below).
</p><p>If you register with the site, or opt in to receiving notifications when providing personal information, FeedBlitz may use your mailing address, telephone number, or email address to alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, and new services.  If you request it, we will cease to contact you using one or more of these methods.
</p><h2>Email Addresses, Publishers and Subscriptions</h2>
<p>When you subscribe to a feed published using FeedBlitz, we <i>will</i> share your email address with the publisher of that feed, but with nobody else (unless required to do so by a court of law with appropriate jurisdiction).  You may set your profile preferences to be anonymous to stop such publisher notifications.   
</p><p>Your email address will never otherwise be shared by FeedBlitz with third parties.  To prevent spamming, we required all new subscription requests to be confirmed via email before they are activated.  Otherwise, we act solely based on the publisher's instructions and preferences, as determined by their FeedBlitz configuration and use of FeedBlitz services.  
</p><h2>Unsubscribing</h2>
<p>You may unsubscribe at any time. Use the links in the emails we send to unsubscribe online for immediate removal.  Alternatively, you may write an email to support, write to our corporate address or phone us to request removal.  We will honor such requests within one (US, east coast) business day.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>FeedBlitz requires cookies to function. Cookies are used to ensure the correct functioning of the service we provide.  We use cookies only for this purpose.  If you disable cookies in your browser you will be unable to use FeedBlitz services.
</p><p>FeedBlitz will not permit third-party cookies to track your activity on the FeedBlitz web site.  FeedBlitz is not responsible for cookies used by content providers in the feeds we circulate, however.
</p><h2>Security Policy</h2>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. Our web site protects sensitive information such as your login credentials using Internet industry standard encryption protocols to encrypt the information in transit. Credit card information is managed by our industry leading payment provider(s), and neither stored on nor transmitted by FeedBlitz systems.
</p><p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 
</p><h2>Server Logs</h2>
<p>The FeedBlitz web server and parts of the FeedBlitz application log activity to file.  We use logs to provide site-wide reporting, to ensure smooth operation of the services FeedBlitz delivers, and for general web site and application maintenance.  Like almost all Internet servers, logged information may include timestamps, your client IP address (as it appears to the server), and the page(s) you visit.  Our detailed server logs will not be shared with any third party.  We may however elect to publish aggregate statistics on visitor activity from time to time based on log information (e.g. "we had 1,234 visitors yesterday").  We will never publish any personally identifiable information in these analyses.
