          <td>
          	<p>The FeedRoom strives to protect the privacy and security of all its  users, email subscribers, and sweepstakes entrants. Please read the ensuing  policy to understand how we will treat the personal information that you give  to us. Our privacy procedures include the following:<br>
          		1. We give full disclosure of our privacy policies and procedures.<br>
          		2. We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to  anyone without your permission.<br>
          		3. We allow all users to opt out at any time from receiving e-mail  messages from The FeedRoom as well as its sponsors and business partners.<br>
          		4. We allow users to access their user profiles and change their  information whenever they want.</p>
          	<p>This policy may change as procedures and requirements evolve, and as we  modify or expand our business. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we  will post these changes on this page so that you are always aware of how, when  and under what circumstances we collect, use and disclose your personal data.  In addition, if you so elect, we will send you an email whenever we make such  changes to this policy. Your continued use of The FeedRoom is your agreement to  any such changes.</p>
          	<p>It is important to be aware that our website contains links to other  sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other  websites. This privacy policy only applies to information collected from you on  The FeedRoom.</p>
          	<p>REGISTRATION DATA:<br>
          		During sweepstakes or email registration, The FeedRoom may collect  personally identifiable information that includes your name, address, email  address, birth date, gender, and phone number. Once you provide this data to  The FeedRoom, you are no longer anonymous. You do not have to provide any  personal information to enter The FeedRoom. However, if you choose to withhold  requested information, you will not be registered and you will not be entered  into The FeedRoom sweepstakes. In addition, we may not be able to provide you  with some of the other services dependent upon the collection of such data,  such as discounts from our sponsors.</p>
          	<p>What are cookies and how does The FeedRoom use them?</p>
          	<p>COOKIES:<br>
          		A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous  unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and  stored on your computer's hard drive. Each web site can send its own cookie to  your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your  privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has  already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.</p>
          	<p>USER CHOICES ABOUT COOKIES:<br>
          		You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all  cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. In order to use the FeedRoom and  enter its sweepstakes, we recommend that our users surf, with cookies turned  on.</p>
          	<p>THE FEEDROOM USES ITS OWN COOKIES FOR A NUMBER OF PURPOSES, INCLUDING  TO:<br>
          		1. Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using FeedRoom  services.<br>
          		2. Display the most appropriate advertising, based on your interests and  activity on FeedRoom.<br>
          		3. Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic.<br>
          		4. Conduct research to improve The FeedRoom's content and services.<br>
          		5. The FeedRoom uses cookies to track user entries in its sweepstakes.</p>
          	<p>OTHER COMPANIES' COOKIES ON THE FEEDROOM:<br>
          		1. Please note that the FeedRoom allows other companies that are  presenting advertisements on some of our pages, or serving email newsletters,  to set and access their cookies on your computer.<br>
          		2. Advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy  policies, not the FeedRoom Privacy Policy.</p>
          	<p>OTHER DATA COLLECTED:<br>
          		Periodically, The FeedRoom may collect additional personal data about  you as well as aggregate information on entrants. This may include:<br>
          		1. Information you provide when registering to receive goods or  services from one or more of our partners.<br>
          		2. Information you provide when entering a contest, sweepstakes or  promotion sponsored by The FeedRoom and/or one of our partners.<br>
          		3. Information you provide when filling out a user survey.<br>
          		4. Information you provide if you contact our customer service center.<br>
          		5. Information you provide when subscribing to our email newsletter.<br>
          		6. Data related to the areas of The FeedRoom that you visited and how  much you frequent those areas. This includes the co-branded sections of The  FeedRoom that are a part of our overall business.<br>
          		7. The FeedRoom may also collect information at other times.</p>
          	<p>How does The FeedRoom use personal information?<br>
          		The FeedRoom uses the information that you supply us to enhance your  FeedRoom experience through personalization and by providing you with special  opportunities that we think you will find valuable. We also use anonymous,  aggregated data to study site traffic patterns. Such information allows us to  further personalize our offerings to you through advertising and promotions.<br>
          		We also use your registration data in connection with The FeedRoom  sweepstakes in order to track your progress, to notify you if you are a winner,  and to ensure that we comply with state and federal laws.<br>Regarding our personalized offerings, The FeedRoom uses the data it  collects among other things, to:<br>
          		1. Provide your personal information to selected third parties unless  you have opted not to permit such sharing.<br>
          		2. Provide you with advertising, email newsletters, and other  promotional offers that we believe will be of interest to you.<br>
          		3. Contact users for feedback regarding The FeedRoom and The FeedRoom's  partners via email surveys.<br>
          		We may also use the aggregate data we collect to develop summary reports  for our advertisers. A report may specify that, "100,000 people clicked on  this link and of those people, 15% were registered users below the age of  25." We provide this information to assist our advertisers in determining  how to promote their products. We do not tell our advertisers who it was that  saw or clicked on their advertisements unless you have given us your  permission.<br>
          		Unless you have opted out of receiving special offers or emails from  selected third parties, we also may provide a report to our advertisers which  tells them who responded to a particular offer. For example, we might send you  an email offering you a discount on a particular service. If you click on that  e-mail or accept an offer or discount contained therein, we may provide the advertiser  with the information necessary to provide you with that discount.<br>
       		</p>
          	<p>What is The FeedRoom's policy regarding children's privacy?<br>
          		The FeedRoom is committed to the safety of children. Children under the  age of 18 may not participate in The FeedRoom sweepstakes or promotions. If  children under 18 continue to use The FeedRoom, they should ask a parent for  permission before sending any information to the site, or sending personal  information to anyone on line.<br>
          		1. The FeedRoom will not request or knowingly collect from a child any  information that can be traced to the child, such as an email address, name or  information about the child's family.<br>
          		2. The FeedRoom will not knowingly use personal information from  children under the age of 13 for any marketing or promotional purposes.<br>
       		3. The FeedRoom will not send any direct email offers to users who  indicate that they are under the age of 13.</p>
          	<p>What choices are available to entrants regarding the collection,  disclosure and distribution of personal information, and how can an entrant  opt-out?<br>
          	  You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally  identifiable information simply by clicking on the opt-out button, or by not  filling out the sweepstakes entrance form. Although keeping your data private  will not prevent you from using The FeedRoom, keep in mind that you must  provide some personally identifiable information in order to participate in The  FeedRoom sweepstakes.<br>
          	  You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from The  FeedRoom or from having your personally identifiable information shared with  selected companies. If you want to edit your preferences with respect to email  or the sharing of information, send us an email with your request. If you elect  to "opt out" we will not share your personal information with third  parties or send you emails. However, The FeedRoom may continue using your data  for internal purposes, to conduct sweepstakes and promotions, to enhance our  site or to comply with state and federal laws.<br>
       		</p>
          	<p>Who has access to your personally identifiable information?<br>
          		Your sweepstakes registration data is accessible only to The FeedRoom.  The FeedRoom takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely  and in accordance with this privacy policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission  over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. As a result, while we strive to  protect your personal information we cannot guarantee the security of any  information you transmit to us, and you use these services at your own risk.<br>
       		</p>
          	<p>How and when is information disclosed to third parties?<br>
       		The FeedRoom does not disclose your personally identifiable information  to any third party without giving you the opportunity to opt out, except in  special situations described in the following paragraph. However, The FeedRoom  may disclose certain aggregate data to third parties. As mentioned earlier,  examples of aggregate data would consist of the following: "26% of users  link to Company X" or "73% of users are female." Such aggregate  data will in no way identify you personally.</p>
          	<p>Administering the site and compliance with the law: The FeedRoom may  disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith  that we are required to do so in order to comply with state and federal law, a  subpoena, or other legal process. The FeedRoom may also disclose account  information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is  necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be  violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the  public. In addition, The FeedRoom may access account information for  administrative and other purposes that we believe to be necessary to the  development, maintenance and improvement of our business, such as to better  customize the site based upon your preferences.</p>
          	<p>Sweepstakes, promotions and sponsorships: The FeedRoom may disclose  your personal information to selected companies, including sponsors of  promotions or sweepstakes available through The FeedRoom, unless you opt out  during sweepstakes registration or by editing your preferences. Special sponsor  promotions may often involve a request for additional information. By  submitting this additional information, you give The FeedRoom permission to  transfer this information to the sponsors so they can fulfill your request or  administer the promotion. You should review any applicable sweepstakes and  promotion rules or user agreement to see what is being shared. If personally  identifying data about you will be shared, we will disclose this to you either  before we collect or transfer the data.<br>
       	    The FeedRoom may use publicly available consumer data to present you  with special advertising offers and promotions. In such instances, The FeedRoom  DOES NOT give out your personally identifiable information to the party  providing the public data. Under confidentiality agreements that do not permit  reuse or disclosure, The FeedRoom may match your user information with third  party data. We might occasionally do this to help determine whether a particular  offer or promotion will be of interest to our users.</p>
          	<p>Email newsletter subscriptions: The FeedRoom may collect email and  personally identifiable information in order to distribute targeted,  promotional email newsletters for The FeedRoom web sites. This information is  disclosed to third-party ad serving and email delivery solutions for the  purpose of optimizing your experience on The FeedRoom. You reserve the right to  "unsubscribe" from The FeedRoom email subscriber list at any time.<br>
       	    </p>
          	<p>Who can you contact with questions regarding this privacy policy?<br>
