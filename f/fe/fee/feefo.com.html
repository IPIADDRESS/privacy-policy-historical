<strong>3 Our relationship to you and your personal data</strong><br>

<br>
<strong>Emails inviting you to submit a review</strong> Here, we act as <strong>data processor</strong>, solely on behalf and on the instruction of the merchant/retailer.<br>
<br>
Where we email you to ask you to submit a review in respect of a merchant/retailer’s product or service, that merchant/retailer has given us your name and email address, and asked us to send you such email.<br>
<br>
We will not use your name and email address for any other purpose, unless we already hold it in respect of a review (see paragraph 3.2 below). Even where we already hold your name and email address, we will only invite you to submit a review where the merchant/retailer has provided the same name and email address.<br>
<br>
<strong>3.2 When you visit our website, and your review itself (and any other data you submit with it)</strong><br>
<br>

We may also collect personal data contained in any forms you submit to our website, including the details of any review you submit.<br>
<br>
The purposes for which we use your personal data are set out in the table below.<br>
<br>
Please note that merchant/retailer will also be a data controller of review data, and you may need to contact both us and the merchant/retailer to exercise rights in respect of your personal data.<br>
<br>
<strong>4 Who you should contact in relation to your personal data and your rights</strong><br>

<br>
<strong>5 The processing</strong><br>
<br>
5.1 This privacy policy applies to customers of merchants/retailers that use our services, and visitors to our website.<br>

<br>

<br>
We keep your data for the length of the contract we have with our customer as this is used for statistical purposes.<br>
<br>
5.4 Where multiple retention periods apply to the same personal data, the retention period will be the longest one (although we will stop using such personal data for a purpose when the retention period for that purpose expires).<br>
<br>

<br>
5.6 Other than the personal data set out above, we also collect certain non personal data, which might derive from personal data. For instance, we may aggregate statistics about trends in buying habits, or trends in user sentiment. Unless it is impossible to re-identify you from this information, we will treat it as personal data.<br>

<br>
(a) there are adequate safeguards in place (such as the appropriate contractual arrangements with suppliers, or adequacy decisions, depending on the destination country); or<br>

<br>
