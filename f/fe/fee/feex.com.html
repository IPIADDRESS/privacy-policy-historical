			<div class="textPageDataSection">
				<h2>2. Which information we may collect on our Users?</h2>
<p>We may collect two types of data and information from our Users:</p>
<ol>
   <li> The first type of information is non-identifiable and anonymous information ("<span class="semibold">
 “Non-personal Information”</span>). We are not aware of the identity of the User from which we have collected Non-personal Information. Non-Personal Information is any unconcealed information which is available to us while Users are using the Site and/or Service. Non-personal Information which is being gathered consists of technical information and behavioral information, including, but not limited to, the User's operating system, type of browser, screen resolution, Flash version, the User's 'click-stream' on the Site, the period of time the User visited the Site, etc.

.
						<ul>
							<li>Users who are only visiting the Site do not need to provide any Personal Information.</li>
							<li> Users who are interested in opening an Account in order to use our Services should provide details via the registration form of the Site, i.e., e-mail address. The User may also provide, at his/her sole discretion, his/her age.</li> 
							<li>The User's IP address.</li>
							<li> In addition, we may also collect and store financial Data (as such term is defined in the TOU) related to Users which may be considered as personally identifiable (for example, the name of bank or financial institution, type of financial service/product in question, the name of your investment plan and/or employer, fees and other characteristics related to your investments, etc.).</li>
							<li> In case the User chooses to provide FeeX with Data through the "Link Accounts" option then also the log-in credentials to any financial institutions' accounts to which the User provides us access (as necessary, usernames and passwords that the User provides to obtain the relevant information from his/her financial service provider).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				
					<li><p class="underlined"> Please note: if you choose to provide FeeX with Data through the "Link Accounts" option, FeeX will only use your respective log-in credentials in order to retrieve the Data you have authorized FeeX to retrieve through the use of our third party service providers (see below). FeeX does not store or keep your log-in credentials.</p></li>
					<li><p><span class="semibold"> We will not collect any Personal Information from you without your approval which is obtained, inter alia, through Your active acceptance to the TOU and the Privacy Policy.</span></p></li>
					<li><p><span class="semibold"> Your Data is used in order to provide the Service provided in the Site. When we do that, we only use the non-identifiable information relating to your financial Data and not your identifiable information.</span></p></li>
				</ol>			</div>
			
			<div class="textPageDataSection">

				</li></ol>			</div>
			
			<div class="textPageDataSection">
				<h2>4. What are the Purposes of the Collection of Information?</h2>

				<ul>
					<li> Create aggregated statistical data for research purposes and customization and improvement of the Site and/or Service.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Personal Information is collected in order to:</p>
				<ul>
