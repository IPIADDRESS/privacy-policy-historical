  <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
  <p>The following describes the overall company Privacy Policy of FetchBack, Inc (referred to as “FetchBack”, “we”, “us” and “our”).
    We understand how important it is to keep your personal information confidential, especially online. Our commitment to protecting
    your privacy is outlined in the policies below. This Privacy Policy was created to inform you what information we collect
    when you visit FetchBack.com as well as our customer’s (referred to as “Advertisers”) websites; and then
    how that information is collected and used by companies that display advertisements(referred to as “Partners”).
    Those who visit our Advertisers’ websites are referred to as “Prospects” throughout this policy. Because
    our Privacy Policy may be updated periodically, we encourage you to review these pages on a regular basis.</p>
  <p>FetchBack is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative. You can learn more about the Network Advertising Initiative,
    as well as opt-out of FetchBack and other behavioral marketing tools by visiting <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a></p>
  <p>Fetchback is also a licensee of the TRUSTe Web Privacy Seal Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose
    mission is to build user’s trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.
    This privacy statement covers the Web site www.fetchback.com. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to
    your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by
    TRUSTe.</p>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact <a href="mailto:customerservice@FetchBack.com">customerservice@FetchBack.com</a>.
    If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact

    concerns.</p>
  <p><strong>Personal and Non-Personal Information</strong></p>
  <p>Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) is data about you that is personally identifiable; like your name,
    email address, credit card number or any other information that is not otherwise publicly available. The PII that FetchBack
    collects from you is information you supply to us; such as your name, email address, credit card number and FetchBack.com
    account login. That information is maintained by FetchBack so that you do not have to enter it each time you visit our website
    to login to your account.</p>
  <p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“NPII”) data is collected by FetchBack and FetchBack’s
    Partners, and is used by FetchBack for the purpose of online Retargeting. NPII data collected by FetchBack for advertising
    purposes is completely anonymous, and only includes information such as the Prospect’s IP address, date and time of
    visit, domain type, and their activity on our Advertiser’s and Partner’s websites. None of this information, individually
    or grouped together, can be traced back to a specific individual. </p>
  <p><strong>Cookies </strong></p>
  <p>In computer language, a cookie is used to store data on a computer's hard drive. Almost all websites utilize cookies to one
    extent or another. FetchBack uses it’s cookies to provide a service known as Retargeting (details explaining Retargeting
    found below.) A Prospect receives a cookie from FetchBack and FetchBack’s Partners when they visit FetchBack.com, and
    / or when they visit one of FetchBack’s Advertiser’s websites. FetchBack has no access to or control over Partner
    cookies but requires that each Partner only collect NPII information for the use of serving retargeted ads. Any Partner found
    in violation of this policy will immediately be removed.</p>
  <p><strong>FetchBack’s Use of Cookies and NPII</strong></p>
  <p>FetchBack’s technology utilizes cookies in the delivery of advertisements to our Advertiser’s Prospects on our
    Partner’s websites across the internet. This form of marketing is called Retargeting; and it enhances the web surfing
    experience by showing advertisements to the Prospect that are of interest to them. When a Prospect visits one of FetchBack’s
    Advertiser’s websites, a FetchBack pixel on that site sets a FetchBack cookie on the hard drive of the Prospect. When
    that Prospect visits one of FetchBack’s Partners’ websites; our Partner’s website will identify the cookie
    on hard drive of the Prospect and recognize that they previously visited our Advertiser’s website. The Prospect will
    then be shown an advertisement from that Advertiser. In this instance, FetchBack will know that the Prospect first visited
    our Advertiser’s website, and then our Partner’s website. We will know the Prospect viewed the Ad on our Partner’s
    website, and wither or not the Prospect clicked on that Ad. This type information is what FetchBack uses in reporting; and
    in no way can be used to identify who that Prospect is, or any other online activities of the Prospect outside of FetchBack’s
    Advertisers and Partner’s websites.</p>
  <p>The NPII data collected by FetchBack in the above outlined process of Retargeting
    will be kept by FetchBack indefinitely; and maintained and archived in our secured servers. This information is used strictly
    for reporting purposes and is not tied to personal information. You are able to Opt-Out of FetchBack’s services if you
    do not want to be a part of future reporting or take part in Retargeting services from FetchBack – please see below
