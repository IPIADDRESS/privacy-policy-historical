  <p>“… retargeting is a powerful means to bring lift to ad campaign results generating higher conversion rates
    and lowering acquisition costs. You can't get much more effective than targeting a person who has shown interest in a product
    but didn't buy with a related ad that then gets him to buy, right?”</p>
