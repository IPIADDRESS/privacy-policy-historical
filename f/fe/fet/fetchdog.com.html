	<p><strong>Updated 02/25/11</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p align="center"><strong>WE ARE COMMITTED TO SAFEGUARDING YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE.&nbsp; PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY  BEFORE USING THIS SITE. </strong></p>
        <p>Fetch Enterprises, Inc. (“FetchDog,” “we,” “us”, “our”) takes seriously its responsibilities regarding the privacy of each user (“user,” “you” or “your”) of the www.FetchDog.com site (the “Site”).  We want you to understand our practices with regard to collecting and using your information both online and offline and the steps we take to safeguard it.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to  personally identifiable information collected from FetchDog customers. When  this Privacy Policy uses the term "personally identifiable  information," we mean information that identifies a particular individual,  such as the individual’s name, postal address, e-mail address, credit card  number, and telephone number. When other information, such as, for example,  consumer product preferences, or number of children, is directly associated  with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes  personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.  Personally identifiable information is sometimes referred to in this Privacy  Policy as "personal information." </p>
      <p><strong>1.&nbsp; General</strong> <br>
        <br>
      We do not collect any personally  identifiable information unless you voluntarily provide it to us.&nbsp; While  you may use some of the functionality of the Site without registration, some of  the activities and services might require you to subscribe or create an  account.&nbsp; If you do not subscribe or create an account on or through the  Site, the only information we collect will be <strong>“non-personal information</strong>”  (<em>i.e</em>., information that is not traceable back to you and cannot be used  to identify you; for example, non-personal information includes information  such as the web pages that you have viewed) through the use of <strong>“cookies”</strong>.&nbsp;  In general, cookies are small data files that are stored on the hard drive of a  computer and that are accessible only by the party or site that placed the  cookie on the hard drive.&nbsp; If you choose to subscribe or create an account  through the Site, we may require you to submit <strong>personally identifiable  information</strong>.&nbsp; You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the  personally identifiable information you submit to FetchDog.&nbsp; Inaccurate  information (such as an out-of-date email address) will affect the information  you receive when using the Site and our ability to contact you.</p>
      <p><strong>2.&nbsp; Your Consent</strong>      </p>
      <p>BY SUBMITTING PERSONALLY  IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO US, AND/OR BY USING THE SITE, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY  COLLECT, USE AND DISCLOSE SUCH PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN  ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF USE, AND AS PERMITTED OR  REQUIRED BY LAW.<br>
        <br>
If you do not agree with these  terms, do not provide any personally identifiable information to us.&nbsp; If  you refuse or withdraw your consent, or if you choose not to provide us with  any required personally identifiable information, we may not be able to provide  you with certain products or services that can be offered on the Site.</p>
      <p><strong>3.&nbsp;  Feedback</strong></p>
        <p>We welcome any and all questions and  feedback. For privacy-related issues, please contact us at: Fetch Enterprises,  Inc., 100 Fore Street, Portland, ME 04101; <a href="mailto:legal@fetchdog.com">legal@fetchdog.com</a>; or 207-347-2200</p>
      <p><strong>4.&nbsp; Data and Information We Collect</strong> </p>
        <p>a. Personally Identifiable  Information<br>
We may collect personally  identifiable information (including name, address, telephone number, e-mail  address and, when necessary, credit card information) when you:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Place an order from our catalogs or on the Site </li>
          <li>Make a purchase at one of our retail stores </li>
          <li>Return an item or make an exchange </li>
          <li>Inquire about our services </li>
          <li>Request a catalog </li>
          <li>Receive a gift package </li>
          <li>Create an account at FetchDog.com </li>
          <li>Subscribe to a newsletter </li>
          <li>Enter a contest or sweepstakes </li>
          <li>Participate in a marketing survey, promotion or event       either online or offline. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>b. Aggregate Information <br>
          <br>
      The Site collects non-personal  information about you using clickstream technology, so it may not be readily  apparent to you that it is being collected. For instance, when you come to the  Site your IP address is collected.&nbsp; An IP address is often associated with  the place from which you access the Internet (such as your ISP, your company,  or your university).</p>
      <p><strong>5.&nbsp; Use of Data and Information</strong> </p>
        <p>a. Personally Identifiable  Information<br>
          <br>
At FetchDog, we always want to  provide you with the best possible shopping experience and fulfill your orders  exactly as you've requested. In order to do this, we use your personally  identifiable information to allow us to:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Process and track your order </li>
          <li>Provide the services you request </li>
          <li>Contact you about the status of an order </li>
          <li>Send you catalogs or promotional offers we believe will       be of interest to you </li>
          <li>Send you our Newsletter </li>
          <li>Identify your product and service preferences </li>
          <li>Customize our communications to you </li>
          <li>Provide information concerning product recalls or       products you have purchased </li>
          <li>Improve our merchandise selection and customer service </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your e-mail address will be used  only for our newsletter and other promotional or informational mailings from us  and will not be shared with any third parties. Instructions for unsubscribing  are included in every e-mail. </p>
<p>          b. Aggregate Information<br>
          </p>
        <p>We use the aggregate information  that we collect in a manner that does not personally identify any individual.  We use aggregate information to make the Site more interesting and useful to  you. We also track the pages or documents accessed within the Site. This  information is collected for systems administration and for analyzing and  improving the value of the material available on the Site.<br>
          <br>
FetchDog contracts with third  parties service providers that assist FetchDog in better understanding your use  of this site. These third party providers may place cookies on your computer so  we can collect information related to your use of FetchDog.com. This  information allows us to refine and improve the Site for our customers. These  third party providers do NOT collect any credit card, user name or password  information or any other personally identifiable information nor are they  allowed to use data that they collect for us for any other purpose.  Additionally, these third party providers are contractually required to keep  all the information collected for us in strict confidence. </p>
  <p><strong>6.&nbsp; Information We Share with Others </strong> <br>
          </p>
        <p>a. Contractors<br>
          <br>
We contract with other companies  (credit card processors, shippers, sweepstakes promoters, website developers  and others) to provide certain services to FetchDog to fulfill orders, provide  sweepstakes and create or maintain our website. In some instances, these  contractors may have access to personally identifiable information but they  contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the information and  to use it only for purposes of carrying out FetchDog business.<br>
<br>
These companies are usually prohibited by contract from using this information  for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone  other than FetchDog. For example, when you submit a “product review” to the  FetchDog website, your information will be received and managed by an  independent contractor that organizes the reviews and manages that element of  the FetchDog website. Before you submit a review, you should review the “Terms  of Use” and any other applicable terms and conditions that are linked on the  FetchDog website so that you can understand the terms and conditions for  acceptance and use of your information. <br>
<br>
In some instances, you may choose to  deal with some of these contractors directly and provide your personal information  to them. In those instances, you must check the privacy policies on their  independent websites to make sure you are willing to have your personal  information handled to your satisfaction.<br>
          </p>
  <p>b. Third Parties<br>
          </p>
        <p>From time to time, we make our  postal mailing list (names and postal addresses only) available to carefully  screened companies whose products we believe will be of interest to you. If you  prefer that we do not share any information with these companies, please  contact us at one of the addresses set forth in Section 3 of this Privacy  Policy. <br>
          <br>
Your e-mail address is never shared  with any third party (except as described above to our contractors who use it  ONLY to carry out FetchDog business).</p>
        <p>c. PowerReviews, Inc.</p>
        <p>FetchDog.com has arranged with PowerReviews, Inc (d/b/a Buzzillions) ("PowerReviews") to facilitate the collection of customer product reviews on products sold by FetchDog.com. When you submit a product review to FetchDog.com, you are also subject to PowerReviews' terms of use and privacy policies (see <a href="http://www.buzzillions.com/public/legal/index_en_US.html">http://www.buzzillions.com/public/legal/index_en_US.html</a>). Accordingly, you should review those policies prior to submitting a review. Also, reviews you submit may be posted on both <a href="http://www.Buzzillions.com">http://www.Buzzillions.com</a> and our site.</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp; Disclosure Exceptions</strong> <br>
          </p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the above policies,  we reserve the right to disclose your personal information to appropriate third  parties if we are required to do so by law or we believe that such action is  necessary: </p>
        <ul type="disc">

If you prefer not to receive catalogs or other  communications from FetchDog or if you prefer to receive them less frequently, please contact us at one of the addresses set forth in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy. If you no longer wish to receive our electronic newsletter you also may contact us at one of the addresses set forth in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy.<br>
          <br>
Please be sure to provide us your <u>exact  name and address, or the mailing label from your catalog</u>, so that we can be  sure to identify you correctly. Because mailings are planned in advance, it may  take several weeks for your request to become effective.

          </p>
  <p><strong>9.&nbsp; E-mail Use</strong> <br>
          </p>
        <p>When you provide us your e-mail  address, we may send you e-mails necessary to process your order or respond to  a request and to receive our electronic newsletter. For example, after you place  an order at FetchDogdog.com, you will receive an e-mail confirmation.<br>
          <br>
