<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong><br>
We will collect and use personal information about you to respond to your request for products and services offered through this website. We will also collect information in order to notify you about products, services, and other opportunities we think will be of interest to you.

In addition, we might receive information about you from other sources (such as service providers) for tracking purposes. We may add the information we receive about you to your existing account. Like other websites, we also automatically receive and record certain types of information every time you visit us. We use

Likewise, we sometimes use third-party advertising companies to serve and track advertisements appearing on our website.

All lenders in our provider network, which include banks, mortgage lenders and 
brokers, have entered into marketing agreements with FetchARate.com and are required to comply with federal and state privacy regulations. The lenders may contact you by telephone, email, or mail based on the information you provided to us in order to process and fulfill your request, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the Federal Trade Commission, any state equivalent Do Not Call List, or the Do Not Call List of an internal company. If one of the lenders contacts 
you by telephone and you wish not to be contacted again by that lender with respect to your inquiry, then you should specifically make a request to that lender not to contact you again. If the lender disregards your request and contacts you again, please let us know immediately by sending an email to FetchARate.com Customer Care. Please note that the lenders may maintain the information you provided whether you elect to use their services or not.</p>
<p> <strong>Other Products or Service Requests</strong> - If you submit a request for a product or service other than a loan such Internet access, automobile insurance or long distance telephone service, we will share the personal information contained in your request form such as your full name, telephone number and email address with our business partners to process and fulfill your request.

to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section within any email you receive from us or unsubscribe from our homepage by clicking here.</p>
