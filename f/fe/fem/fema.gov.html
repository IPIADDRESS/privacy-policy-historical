Viewer Privacy and Security Notice
</h3>
1. This World Wide Web (WWW) site is provided as a public service by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
<p>
2. Information presented on this WWW site is considered public information and may be distributed or copied. Use of appropriate byline/photo/image credits is requested. 
</p><p>
3. For site management, information is collected for statistical purposes. This government computer system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. 
</p><p>
4. For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this federal government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. 
</p><p>
5. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration General Schedule 20. 
</p><p>
6. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. 
</p><p>
7. This is how we will handle information we learn about you from your visit to our website. The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting our site.
</p><p>
If you visit our site to read or download information, such as consumer brochures or press releases: 
</p><ul>



We collect and store only the following information about you: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or psu.edu if you are connecting from Pennsylvania State University's domain); the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site.

<p>
8. Cookies:
</p><ul>
<li> The only cookies used on the FEMA web are to allow
several complex software user-driven applications to work correctly.
Specifically, our online US Fire Administration publications ordering
service allows users to "shop" through the catalog. As a user goes through and
checksoff a series of publications, each transaction is a separate "signal"
sent between their computer and ours.  In order to maintain a complete record
of the total order, the FEMA server sends a cookie to identify that user's
order.  The only information collected is related to that particular publication
order and this information is NOT retained once the order is sent.
</li><li>           
This is the current state of technology on the Web.  We are constantly
looking for ways to improve our online services.  If new applications are developed
that will provide these services without the use of cookies, we will
definitely look into them.
</li><li>
Please be assured that FEMA's use of cookie technology is NOT a covert
attempt to either collect or analyze information on Internet users.
