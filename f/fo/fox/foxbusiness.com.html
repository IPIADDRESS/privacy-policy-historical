                      <p>Fox News Network, LLC ("Fox News" or "we") wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications ("apps"), and widgets (collectively, the "Fox News Services"). By using Fox News Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
                      <p>As set forth in our <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/about/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a>, the Fox News Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>
                      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the Fox News Services without being registered with or subscribing to a Fox News Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to a Fox News Service. This Privacy Policy applies to Fox News's collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address). It also describes generally Fox News's practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage).</p>
                          <a name="collection"></a>
                    <h2>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION </h2>
                      <p>Fox News and our service providers collect the following information from and about you:</p>
                      <p><strong>Registration Information</strong> is the information you submit to register for a Fox News Service, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code and birthday.</p>
                      <p><strong>Public Information and Posts</strong> consist of comments or content that you post to the Fox News Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture. Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.</p>
                      <p><strong>Information from Social Media.</strong>. If you access or log-in to a Fox News Service through a social media service or connect a Fox News Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service.

                      <p><strong>Activity Information.</strong>.When you access and interact with the Fox News Services, we may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Fox News Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Fox News Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data, or other transactional information for that device. At this time we do not respond to browser 'Do Not Track' signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.</p>
                      <p>Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier. Websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Fox News Services, such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen. If Fox News wishes to combine your personal information with information we obtain through these technologies in order to determine what messages Fox News provides to you, we will obtain your express affirmative consent.</p>
