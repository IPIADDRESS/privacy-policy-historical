<h3>FOX Connect Privacy Policy</h3>
<h4 style="float:left;">WWW.FOXCONNECT.COM</h4>

Effective as of March 3, 2009 
</div>
<div class="col2-set">
<div class="col-1">
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">FoxConnect ("Fox Connect"), 
is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy 
Principles applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. Fox Connect has 
implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes 
how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") 
we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S both online 
and offline.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">From time to time Fox Connect 
may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes 
in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of our 
web sites, or technology. If we make revisions that change the way we 
collect or use your PII, those changes will be posted in this Privacy 
Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of the 
Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are 
up to date on our most current policies and practices. If Fox Connect 
materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your 
PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Policy under which 
it was collected unless you have been provided notice of and have not 
objected to the change.</font> <br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><b><u>COLLECTION:</u></b></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><u> COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") BY FOX CONNECT</u> </span></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">General. Fox Connect collects 
personally identifiable information ("PII", that is, information 
such as your full name, email address, mailing address, credit card 
information or telephone number) in order to provide you with a requested 
service or to create or enhance our relationship with you.  When we 
collect PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the 
information to us in order to participate in activities like sweepstakes, 
contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations in connection 
with content or suggestions you submit to us, chats, bulletin boards, 
or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information. 
We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties.  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Cookies. Cookies are small 
bits of information that the Internet sites operated by Fox Connect place 
on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about 
your activities on our site and enable Fox Connect to make your visits 
to our site more enjoyable. For example, cookies can track the things 
you have placed your "shopping cart" during a visit to our 
online store.  Information about your activities on Fox Connectâ€™s 
site(s)  and other non-personally identifiable information about 
you may also be used to limit the online ads you encounter to those 
we believe are consistent with your interests.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Third party advertisements 
displayed on Fox Connect's site(s) may also contain cookies set by Internet 
Advertising companies or advertisers. Fox Connect does not control these 
cookies and visitors to our web site(s) sent by Internet Advertisers 
or other companies should check the privacy policy of the advertiser 
to see whether and how it uses cookies.  A pixel tag is a tiny 
image inserted in a webpage and used to record the number and types 
of views for that page.  Fox Connect may allow third party pixel 
tags to be present on Fox Connect sites for purpose of advertising, providing 
services or data and statistics collection.  We also may use pixel 
tags in order to recognize users and assess traffic patterns, and we 
may include pixel tags and cookies in our e-mail messages in order to 
count how many e-mail messages have been opened.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fox Connect may use cookies, 
pixels or similar tools to relate your use of our web site(s)  
to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you've asked 
us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, 
cookie and/or click stream information about your activities on Fox 
Connect's website(s) may allow us to limit the materials we send you to 
items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online 
activities and preferences. However, if Fox Connect wishes to combine 
your personal and cookie or clickstream information in this manner, 
we will obtain your express affirmative consent (i.e., "opt in").</font> <br>
</p><p><font size="2" face="Arial">You can program your computer 
to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely. 
However, without cookies you won't be able to conduct transactions such 
as placing an order via our shopping cart or completing a sale for any 
VHS or DVD merchandise.</font> <br></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><b><u>NOTICE:</u></b></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><u> FOX CONNECT WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH
NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES</u> </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When you voluntarily provide 
PII to Fox Connect, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting 
the information, how and why the information is being collected and 
the types of uses Fox Connect will make of the information. At the time 
you provide PII, Fox Connect will notify you of your options regarding 
our use of your PII, including whether we will share it with outside 
companies (See "Choice" below).</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This Policy describes the types 
of other companies that may want to send you information about their 
products and services and therefore want to share your personal information 
provided you have given Fox Connect permission to do so (See "Use" 
below).</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sometimes we collect personally 
identifiable information from consumers in manual format or off-line, 
such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice 
in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead 
be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full 
text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fox Connect's web site(s) may 
be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of these 
third party sites may be co-branded with a Fox Connect logo, even though 
they are not operated or maintained by Fox Connect. Fox Connect's web site(s) 
may also carry advertisements from other companies. Fox Connect is not 
responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third 
parties that are linked to our site(s) or for the privacy practices 
of third party or national Internet Advertising companies. Once you've 
left a Fox Connect site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, 
you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or 
advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect 
from you.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fox Connect's web site(s) may 
also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with Fox Connect 
(i.e., that are part of the News America Group). Although News America 
Group entities adhere to the Group's Privacy Principles, visitors to 
those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy 
policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this 
Policy.</font> <br></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><b><u>CHOICE:</u></b></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><u> FOX CONNECT WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH
CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII</u> </span></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fox Connect will not use the 
PII you provide to us for purposes different from the purpose for which 
it was submitted or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated 
with Fox Connect (i.e, not part of the News America Group), except as 
disclosed in this Privacy Policy or unless we obtain your permission.  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><b><u>USE:</u></b></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><u> FOX CONNECT'S USE OF PII</u> </span></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fox Connect will use your PII 
in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. If Fox Connect obtains 
PII from a third party such as a business partner, our use of that information 
is governed by this policy.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fox Connect may share your PII 
with companies that are affiliated with us, that is are part of the 
News America Group of companies. Provided you have given us consent, 
Fox Connect may also share your PII with advertisers and business partners 
that are not affiliated with Fox Connect, but would like to send you information 
about their products and services. However, you will always have the 
opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third 
parties when</font><font size="1" face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">PII is collected.  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fox Connect employees, agents 
and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access 
to your PII. Fox Connect may share your PII with outside contractors or 
agents who provide services on our behalf.  Examples of such services 
include without limitation website hosting, ad serving, customer service, 
product purchase services (including order, fulfillment and payment 
authorization and processing services), fraud prevention and investigation, 
data analysis and promotional assistance (including sending communications 
and creating, administering and operating contests, sweepstakes or other 
games).  Such outside contractors or agents may only use PII to 
provide Fox Connect with a specific service and not for any other purpose 
unless specified on the Fox Connect website or on any third party website 
where you participate in the activity(ies).  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There may be instances when 
Fox Connect may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order 
to protect the legal rights of Fox Connect, other companies within the 
News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect 
the safety and security of visitors to our web sites; to protect against 
fraud and for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or 
legal process. In addition, if Fox Connect sells all or part of its business 
or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a 
merger or business transfer, Fox Connect may transfer your PII to a third 
party as part of that transaction.</font> <br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><b><u>SECURITY:</u></b></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><u> FOX Connect PROTECTS THE SECURITY
OF PII</u> </span></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fox Connect uses reasonable administrative, 
technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession 
against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. 
In addition, Fox Connect uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII 
is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.</font> <br>
