</p><p><span class="storyhed">Privacy Statement</span><br>
  <br>
  <span class="story">By using this site, you agree to the Privacy Policy of Foxsports.com. If you 
  do not agree to the Policy, please do not use this site. Foxsports.com reviews 
  its privacy policy periodically and reserves the right, at its discretion, to 
  modify or remove portions of this policy at any time. This page should be reviewed 
  periodically so that you are updated on any changes. If you want to communicate 
  with us about our policy, please write to us at Foxsports.com, 1925 South Bundy 
  Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA, or e-mail us at <a class="link" href="mailto:feedback@foxsports.com">feedback@foxsports.com</a>. 
</span></p>
<p>Foxsports.com recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personally 
  identifiable information collected about visitors to our sites. As a general 
  policy, no personally identifiable information, such as your name, address or 
  email address, is automatically collected from visitors to our sites. Personally 
  identifiable information about visitors to our sites is collected only when 
  knowingly and voluntarily submitted. We may collect certain non-personal information 
  to optimize our Web pages for your computer (i.e., the identity of your Internet 
  browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP address and the domain 
  name of your Internet service provider). We may use such non-personal information 
  for internal purposes, including but not limited to improving the content of 
  our sites. </p>
<p>In those instances when we do collect personally identifiable information, 
  the following policies apply: </p>
<p><b>Notice</b> <br>
  Foxsports.com will notify you when we are collecting personally identifiable 
  information about you and how we intend to use it. For example, we may need 
  to collect such information to provide you with information or a product you 
  requested, in connection with contest entry forms or for billing purposes, or 
  in connection with community postings such as chat and bulletin boards. <br>
  Sometimes Foxsports.com engages in activities with business partners and sponsors 
  with whom personal information is jointly collected or shared. We will try to 
  make it clear at the time of collection who is asking for and/or sharing your 
  information. In situations where your information will be shared, it is recommended 
  that you also review the privacy policy of our business partner or sponsor.</p>
<p><b>Use and Security</b> <br>
  Personally identifiable information that visitors submit to our sites is used 
  only for the purpose for which it is submitted unless we disclose other uses 
  in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection. Such other uses may include 
  sending you information or materials we think you will find interesting, or 
  sharing the information with Foxsports.com's advertisers and reputable business 
  partners. However, at the time of collection, you will have the option of instructing 
  us not to send you additional information or share your personal information 
  with third parties. Foxsports.com is not responsible for the privacy policies 
  or practices of our business partners. </p>
<p>Foxsports.com may use reputable third parties to manage activities available 
  on our sites including, but not limited to, sweepstakes, contests, statistical 
  analysis, or chats. These parties may have access to personally identifiable 
  information submitted by visitors who participate in those activities. Similarly, 
  we may contract with third parties to handle the fulfillment of subscriptions 
  or requests for information you submit to our sites, such as sending you a newsletter. 
  In most instances, Foxsports.com instructs these third parties to use personally 
  identifiable information only for the specific purpose for which it is collected, 
  and not to sell, market or transfer such information to other entities. If Foxsports.com 
  obtains personal information that has been collected from you by a third party, 
  including our business partners, this Privacy Policy nonetheless governs Foxsports.com's 
  use of that information.</p>
<p>Please remember that any information posted on bulletin boards and/or communicated 
  in chat areas becomes public information. You should use caution when sharing 
  information as any of it can be collected and used by people you may not know. 
  Users under the age of 18 should be particularly careful not to divulge any 
  personal information. While Foxsports.com strives to protect and respect your 
  privacy, we can not guarantee the security of any information you disclose in 
  a chat room or bulletin board and you do so at your own risk. </p>
<p>Foxsports.com may use personally identifiable information in aggregate form 
  to make our sites better and more responsive to the needs of our visitors. This 
  statistical compilation and analysis of information may also be used by Foxsports.com 
  or provided to others, in aggregate, for marketing, advertising or research 
  purposes. </p>
<p>If at any time after submitting your personal information to our sites you 
  would no longer like to receive information from us, simply follow the "unsubscribe" 
  directions at the end of any email communication you receive. </p>
<p>Foxsports.com does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information 
  from children under the age of 13.</p>
<p>Personal information may be disclosed in special situations where Foxsports.com 
  has reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring 
  legal action against anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering (intentionally 
  or unintentionally) with Foxsports.com's rights, property, users, or anyone 
  else who could be harmed by such activities. Also, Foxsports.com may reveal 
  information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. </p>
<p>Foxsports.com maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity 
  and privacy of personally identifiable information submitted to our sites, and 
  periodically reviews and updates its security measures in light of current technologies. 
  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 
  totally secure. Although Foxsports.com strives to protect your personal information, 
  we can not ensure or warranty the security of any information you may transmit 
  to us or from our online products and services. This is done so at your own 
  risk. Once we do receive your transmission, however, we make our best effort 
  to ensure its security on our systems. When credit card information is transmitted, 
  industry standard encryption is used.</p>
<p><b>Cookies</b> <br>
  Cookies are data that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard-drive for 
  record-keeping purposes. Cookies, which are an industry standard used by most 
  Web sites, including those operated by Foxsports.com, can facilitate a user's 
  ongoing access to and use of a site. They allow us to track usage patterns and 
  to compile data that can help us improve our content and target advertising. 
  Foxsports.com does not save passwords or credit card information within Cookies, 
  nor are our Cookies programs that can cause damage to a user's systems or files. 
  If you do not want information collected through the use of Cookies, there is 
  a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the Cookie 
  feature. But you should note that Cookies may be necessary to provide you with 
  features such as merchandise transactions or registered services. </p>
<p><b>Links to Third Party and Co-Branded Sites </b><br>
  Foxsports.com has established relationships with reputable business partners 
  that allow visitors to our Internet sites to link directly to sites operated 
  by these partners. Some of these sites or sites dedicated to online shopping, 
  may be "co-branded" with a Foxsports.com logo (i.e., Fox, Fox Sports); 
  however, these sites are not operated or maintained by Foxsports.com. These 
  sites may collect personal information from you that may be shared with Foxsports.com. 
  As noted above, this Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information we 
  obtain in this manner.</p>
<p>Foxsports.com chooses its advertisers and business partners carefully. However, 
  Foxsports.com is not responsible for the content or practices of Web sites operated 
  by third parties that are linked to our sites. These links are meant for the 
  user's convenience only. Links to third party sites do not constitute sponsorship, 
  endorsement or approval by Foxsports.com of the content, policies or practices 
  of such third party sites. Once you have left a Foxsports.com site via such 
  a link, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site. 
</p>
<p>Foxsports.com sites may also be linked to Web sites operated by companies affiliated 
  with Foxsports.com. Visitors to those sites should refer to their separate privacy 
  policies and practices. <br>
