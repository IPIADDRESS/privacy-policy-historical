<h4> privacy statement</h4>
     
        Fox Racing, Inc. respects the privacy of every individual who visits our 
        websites. This Privacy Policy outlines the information Fox Racing, Inc. 
        may collect and how we may use that information.<br>
        <br>
        <em><font color="0066ff">Personal Data</font></em><br>
        Fox Racing, Inc. will not collect any personally-identifiable information 
        about you (e.g., your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address 
        ("personal data") through our websites unless you have provided it to 
        us voluntarily. If you do not want your personal data collected, please 
        do not submit it to us.<br>
        <br>
When
you do provide us with personal data, we may use that information in the
following ways, unless stated otherwise: we may store and process that
information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products
and services; we (or a fulfillment house or other third party on our behalf in
connection with a promotion) may use that information to contact you; and/or we
may provide other third parties with aggregate information about visitors to or
users of our sites. In
addition, your personal data and information about your order may be shared
with third parties. This information may be combined with other personally
identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase
history) available from our records and other sources. This information will be
used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. It may also be used
by our marketing partners to bring you offers of interest. <br><br>If you prefer that
we do not share your name and address with marketing partners, please go to <a href="http://shop.foxracing.com/category.asp?catalog%5Fname=MX&amp;category%5Fname=&amp;Page=1">Shop Online</a> and click on "My Account" to log in. Then, select "Do not share my name" at the bottom of your account page and click "Submit" to effect this change.<br>
        <br>
        <em><font color="0066ff">Children</font></em><br>
        Fox Racing, Inc. has no intention of collecting any personal data from 
        individuals under thirteen years of age. Where appropriate, the Company 
        will specifically instruct children not to submit such information on 
        our websites and/or will take reasonable steps to ensure parental consent 
        to such submission.<br>
        <br>
        Parents should be aware that Fox Racing, Inc.'s Privacy Policy will govern 
        our use of personal data, but that information which is voluntarily given 
        by children -- or others -- in chat sessions, e-mail exchanges, bulletin 
        boards or the like may be used by other parties to generate unsolicited 
        mail. Fox Racing encourages all parents to instruct their children in 
        the safe and responsible use of their personal data while using the Internet.<br>
        <br>
        <em><font color="0066ff">Additional Information Collected Automatically</font></em><br>
        In some cases, we may automatically (i.e., not via registration) collect 
        technical information when you connect to our site that is not personally-identifiable. 
        Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet Browser 
        you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using and 
        the domain name of the website from which you linked to our site.<br>
        <br>
        <em><font color="0066ff">Information Placed Automatically on Your Computer 
        -- Cookies</font></em><br>
        When you view one of our websites, we may store some information on your 
        computer. This information will be in the form of a "Cookie" or similar
