<p><a id="scope" name="scope"></a><strong>1. INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>Fox Broadcasting Company (“FOX” or “we”), which operates the FOX.com website, has developed this Privacy Policy to describe how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications (“apps”), widgets, and other content and services that are linked or otherwise refer to or provide the URL to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “FOX Services”). &nbsp;By providing personal information to us and/or using the FOX Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. A list of our affiliated companies (“FOX Affiliates”) is available at<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="external-processed" href="http://www.21cf.com/"><u>www.21cf.com</u></a>.</p>
<p>As set forth in our<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="external-processed" href="https://www.fox.com/privacy">Terms of Use</a>, the FOX Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use some of the FOX Services without being registered with or subscribing to a FOX Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to one or more FOX Service. This Privacy Policy applies to FOX’s collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address). It also describes generally FOX’s practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage).</p>
<p><a id="collection-of-information" name="collection-of-information"></a><strong>2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>FOX and our service providers collect the following information from and about you:</p>
<p><strong>Registration Information</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>is the information you submit to register for a FOX Service, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address and gender.</p>
<p><strong>Public Information and Posts</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>consist of comments or content that you post to the FOX Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture. Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media Information and Content</strong>. If you access or log-in to an FOX Service through a third party social media service or another website, app, service or log-in (“Other Service”), or connect an FOX Service to Other Services, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that Other Service, any information or content you have permitted the Other Service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends’ lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that Other Service (collectively, “Social Media Information and Content”). When you access the FOX Services through Other Services, or when you connect a FOX Service to Other Services, you are authorizing FOX to collect, store, and use any and all Social Media Information and Content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Authenticated Content Access.</strong>&nbsp; To access certain video content via the FOX Services, you will be redirected to your television content provider’s registration page where you will be required to sign in using your television content provider account.&nbsp; Please contact your television content provider directly with questions concerning your account, including how to access, update and manage your personal account information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Activity Information.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>When you access and interact with the FOX Services, FOX and our service providers may collect certain information about those visits. &nbsp;For example, in order to permit your connection to the FOX Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, authentication identifiers, and other software or hardware information. &nbsp;<a id="ads" name="ads"></a>If you access the FOX Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data (including your precise location), or other transactional information for that device in order to provide the FOX Services to it.</p>
<p><a id="ads" name="ads"></a></p>
<p>Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data may also be used. Websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer or other device so the website, app or other service can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that website, app or other service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the FOX Services, such as pages you have visited, the videos and other content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen. Cookies may also be used by us or by our service providers to collect and store information on your use of other companies’ websites or services, such as sites you visit and materials you view.&nbsp; We may merge this with other data we collect about you from third parties to assist us in our ability to provide the Services, including, without limitation, to advertise and provide content to you.&nbsp; Our work in this respect is compliant with the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Principles for the Self-Regulation of Online Behavioral Advertising.&nbsp; To learn more, visit<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="external-processed" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</p>

<p><a id="use-and-disclosure" name="use-and-disclosure"></a><strong>3. USE AND DISCLOSURE</strong></p>
<p>We use the personal information and other information we collect from and about you for the following purposes:</p>
<p><strong>To provide and manage the FOX Service</strong>.

<p><strong>To allow service providers to assist us in providing and managing the FOX Services.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>FOX may make your information we collect from and about you available to certain third party service providers, such as contractors, analytics and other measurement companies, agents or sponsors, who help us analyze and understand your use of the FOX Services, and manage and/or provide the FOX Services.</p>
<p><strong>To deliver video content.</strong>&nbsp; In the ordinary course of our business, we may share information that we collect from or about you with third parties in order to process your requests and fulfill your orders for video content offered through the FOX Services, including, to provide you with access to localized content and provide video content recommendations.&nbsp; For example, to process your request to view certain authenticated video content through the FOX Services, we may share information about you, including, without limitation, what you have viewed, with your designated television content provider and/or our third party service providers in order to authenticate and/or authorize you to view authenticated video content through the FOX Services.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>To provide co-branded services and features.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>We may offer co-branded services or features, such as contests, sweepstakes or other promotions together with a third party (“Co-Branded Services”). These Co-Branded Services may be hosted on FOX Services or on the third party’s service. By virtue of these relationships, we may share the information you submit in connection with the Co-Branded Service with the third party. The third party’s use of your information will be governed by the third party’s privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>To deliver relevant advertisements.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>FOX and our service providers may use the information we collect from or about you, and information that our service providers collect from your use of other websites and services through cookies and other technologies, to assist us in delivering relevant ads to you when you visit the FOX Services (on any of your devices) or Other Services.

<p>Remember that even after you cancel your account, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or Other Services. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others and there may be a delay in the removal of the content from elsewhere on the Internet and from search engines. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. It is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints, contractual, financial or legal requirements.</p>
<p><a id="other-important-information" name="other-important-information"></a><strong>7. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p><strong>Updates to Privacy Policy.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>FOX may modify this Privacy Policy. Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the FOX Services.</p>
<p><strong>Location of Data.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>The FOX Services are hosted in and managed from the United States.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information transferred to and processed in the United States.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>United States data protection and other relevant laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction.

<p><strong>Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (“Payment Service”).

INTRODUCTION</strong></p>\n<p>Fox Broadcasting Company (&ldquo;FOX&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rdquo;), which operates the FOX.com website, has developed this Privacy Policy to describe how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications (&ldquo;apps&rdquo;), widgets, and other content and services that are linked or otherwise refer to or provide the URL to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the &ldquo;FOX Services&rdquo;). &nbsp;By providing personal information to us and/or using the FOX Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy applies to FOX&rsquo;s collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address). It also describes generally FOX&rsquo;s practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage).</p>\n<p><a name=\"collection-of-information\" id=\"collection-of-information\"></a><strong>2.

Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.</p>\n<p><strong>Social Media Information and Content</strong>. If you access or log-in to an FOX Service through a third party social media service or another website, app, service or log-in (&ldquo;Other Service&rdquo;), or connect an FOX Service to Other Services, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that Other Service, any information or content you have permitted the Other Service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends&rsquo; lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that Other Service (collectively, &ldquo;Social Media Information and Content&rdquo;).
