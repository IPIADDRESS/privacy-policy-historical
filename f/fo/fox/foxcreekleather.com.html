<h2 id="gps">Planning on visiting?</h2>

<p>GPS is a great tool, but is fickle in our rural location. Yes, you will eventually arrive at Fox Creek Leather by following your GPS, but it is much faster to stick to the main roads -- Routes 16, 58, and 21 are the most direct routes leading to Fox Creek Leather. The side trips GPS suggests can lead you through some awesome twisties, but our mountain roads are not all paved.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or need directions, please feel free to give us a call. But be warned, there are 'dead zones' with no cell service, too.</p>

<ol class="faq">

  <li id="1">Chaps &amp; Pants
    <ol>
      <li id="1.1">How should my chaps fit?
        <p>You should be able to comfortably tighten the belt, without having to put it on the first or last hole, or by letting out the lacing in the back no more than a few inches.  At your thighs your chaps should be snug, but not to the degree that they cause discomfort.  Wearing your riding boots, your chaps should nick the floor on the inside of your boot.  Remember that your chaps will conform to your body over time; a fit that is a bit snug initially is preferable to one that is too loose.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="1.2">What does braided and not braided mean?
        <p>Our braided chaps have a thin line of braided piping that goes around the waist (yoke) of the chaps.  Our plain (unbraided) chaps do not have the braided piping.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="1.3">What about the hem on my chaps or pants?
        <p>Leather does not need to be hemmed as it will not fray like fabric does.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="1.4">Why do I need to give my measurements for chaps? Can't I just say I need a large?
        <p>To ensure that you get the best possible fit on the first try.  We have found that people who do not give measurements and guess at their size are often unsatisfied with the fit of their chaps.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="1.5">Are the chaps lined?
        <p>Yes, our Men's and Women's <a href="/63-mens-motorcycle-chaps/710-lined-motorcycle-chaps">Lined Motorcycle Chaps</a> and <a href="/63-mens-motorcycle-chaps/1070-deluxe-lined-leather-chaps">Deluxe Lined Leather Chaps</a> have a quilted lining that runs from the belt down to the first snap on the legs. Our standard <a href="/63-mens-motorcycle-chaps/111-leather-motorcycle-chaps">motorcycle chaps</a> come unlined. </p>
      </li>
      <li id="1.6">Which are better, overpants or chaps?
        <p>Overpants offer greater protection in a crash and from wind and water.  However, chaps are lighter and easier to wear.  Many people find that they get all the protection that they want with chaps while others want to be a little warmer.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="1.7">Why do I need to measure to the floor?
        <p>See: <a href="#3.2">Sizing: Why do I need to measure to the floor?</a></p>
      </li>
      <li id="1.8">Are braided chaps for women only?
        <p>No, they are for <a href="/mens_menschaps">men</a> and <a href="/womens_womenschaps">women</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="1.9">How do I put on my chaps?
        <p>We recommend reading this article from our blog: <a href="http://foxcreekleather.wordpress.com/2006/01/18/recommended-process-to-put-on-chaps-for-first-timers/">A must read for any new chaps wearer</a>.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li id="2">Jackets
    <ol>
      <li id="2.1">Does the liner go down the sleeves?
        <p>If a jacket is described as having a "full sleeve" liner, it does in fact extend down the sleeves. All of our jackets have a nylon shell lining the interior of the sleeve regardless of liner type.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="2.2">Do your jackets have armor?
        <p>Most of our men's jackets have provisional pockets that give you the option of using armor. We sell Forcefield <a href="http://www.foxcreekleather.com/mens_mensjackets_motorcyclejacketarmor">elbow, shoulder and back armor</a> inserts.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="2.3">How do I know I have the best fit possible?
       <p>We recommend reading this article from our blog: <a href="http://foxcreekleather.wordpress.com/2012/01/04/how-your-motorcycle-jacket-is-supposed-to-fit/">How Your Motorcycle Jacket Is Supposed To Fit</a>.</p></li>      
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li id="3">Sizing
    <ol>
      <li id="3.1">How much longer is a long?
        <p>For jackets it is 2" longer in the sleeves and the body. For vests, it is 2" longer in length. For chaps, it is 2" longer.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="3.2">Why do I need to measure to the floor?
        <p>When you sit your chaps/pants ride up. It's important to make sure that your chaps are long enough when sitting down that wind doesn't blow up your leg. If they are too short you can not do anything to lengthen them, but if they are too long you can alter them by cutting them to the length that you want. Only alter the length once you are sure that they fit you everywhere else. Please note that once your chaps/pants have been altered, they may not be returned for exchange or refund.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="3.3">Is your sizing standard to other companies'?
        <p>No, most companies size their garments differently.  That is why we often ask for measurements. </p>
      </li>
      <li id="3.5">How are your items supposed to fit?
        <p>The main thing to remember is your comfort. We recommend reading these articles from our blog: <a href="http://foxcreekleather.wordpress.com/2012/01/04/how-your-motorcycle-jacket-is-supposed-to-fit/">How Your Motorcycle Jacket Is Supposed To Fit</a> and <a href="http://foxcreekleather.wordpress.com/2012/03/23/how-your-leather-vest-is-supposed-to-fit/">How Your Leather Vest Is Supposed To Fit</a>.

  <li id="4">About Leather
    <ol>
      <li id="4.1">What does naked leather mean?
        <p>The grain of the hide is unaltered and has only been dyed.  Only the highest quality hides can be used to make naked leather.  Lesser hides are corrected by sanding to remove imperfections. <a onclick="javascript:popUp('/popups/19.html','450','450'); return false;" href="/popups/19.html">More Information »</a></p>
      </li>
      <li id="4.2">What does drum dyed mean?
        <p>It means the leather was immersed in a drum of dye and tumbled.  This method provided the most even and permanent dying that will not bleed. <a onclick="javascript:popUp('/popups/19.html','450','450'); return false;" href="/popups/19.html">More Information »</a></p>
      </li>
      <li id="4.3">What are the benefits of heavy leather?
        <p>Heavy leather provides more protection. Our men's jackets and chaps are typically 1.4-1.6 mm thick.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="4.4">When do I need to treat my leathers and how often?
        <p>It depends on your exposure to the elements how often you need to treat your leather. All of our leather comes treated from the factory and does not need to be treated right away. We do recommend that you treat your leather at least every 6 months. Always be sure to clean and dry before treating. Read our <a href="/help/#leatherCare">Leather Care Guide</a> for more detailed information.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="4.5">What are range marks?
       <p>Leather is a natural material and as such it is subject to minor blemishes and imperfections. These are referred to as range marks. They are actually healed scars and scratches that the animal incurred while alive. These are not defects but authenticate that the material is real leather and make each piece truly one of a kind.</p>

  <li id="5">Custom Orders
    <ol>
      <li id="5.1">How long does it take to make a custom order?
        <p>It depends on the item and the time of year. It will also depend on how many items are in front of yours. It may take up to 8-10 weeks.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="5.2">Will you customize an item I have now?
        <p>No. We only make special orders from scratch.</p>

      </li>
      <li id="5.4">Why do you have to send me a try on jacket? Can't you make it from the measurements that I give you?

      </li>
      <li id="5.5">How much does it cost?
         <p>The price varies and depends on what you want done. It will always be based on the regular price of the item as sale prices do not apply to custom orders. Please see our <a href="http://www.foxcreekleather.com/help/#customOrders">Custom Order</a> page for more information.</p></li>
      <li id="5.6">Who do you recommend for custom work that you can't do?

Believe it or not, the Holidays are getting close, and specials can take up to 10 weeks to make.
</p> -->
<p>Custom orders incur an alteration fee. This is added to the regular price of the item because sale prices are not valid on custom orders. <a href="http://www.foxcreekleather.com/help/">Contact us</a> if you have questions regarding alteration fees for a special or custom order.</p>
    <p>Special orders on jackets and chaps may take up to 8-10 weeks. Special orders on vests take 4-6 weeks. We realize this is a long time, but such a high quality garment with a lifetime guarantee is well worth the wait.
    </p>
    <p>We will try to fit any body. However, we are limited as to what we can alter or change about a pattern. With the
    exception of chaps, all orders will be made from scratch as an item cannot be altered. Below is a list of what we
    can do to customize your leather garment.
    </p>

    <h4>Jackets and Chaps</h4>
    <ul class="dList">
   <li>We can add or remove length from the sleeves and/or body. However, we will not remove length from the sleeve and add length to the body or vice versa. It has to be done in 1" increments with a maximum of 4". Cost - $80.</li>
   <li>We can make an item without certain features (such as epaulets, vents, pockets, reflective piping, the perforated piece on the Bomber, removable liner, etc.). Cost - $0.</li>
  <!-- <li>We can make any of our stock style jackets in brown leather. Cost - $80.</li> -->
   <li>We cannot alter the collar type/size and we cannot alter the shoulder width.</li>
   <li>We cannot make backwards or odd sized chaps (such as XL waist, S thigh) but we can alter the pair that fits your thigh to fit you in the waist. Cost - $30.</li>
   <li>Extra long or larger chaps may be made with additional panels to keep the cost/time down.</li>
   <li>We have the ability to make larger sizes than what we stock but we are limited. The price would depend on what you need. We would send you the closest thing in stock to try before we would special order it for you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Vests</h4>
    <ul class="dList">
    <li>We can add or remove length from the body in 1" increments with a maximum of 4". The length must be adjusted the same in the front
    as in the back. Cost - $40.</li>
    <li>We can make a vest with the gun pocket on the right hand side for left handed persons or with two standard
    pockets instead of a gun pocket. Cost - $40.</li>
    <li>We can make a vest with a different type of snap. Cost - $20.</li>
    <li>We have the ability to make larger sizes than what we stock but we are limited. The price would depend on what
    you need. We would send you the closest thing in stock to try before we would special order it for you.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Special orders cannot be returned for exchange or refund. We may require a non-refundable 50% deposit before making the order.
	</p>
	<p>We require a trial for size fitting process to ensure the fit. We would get your measurements and recommend a
	stock sized item for you to try. You would pay for the stock item and then return it. We must have the trial item
	back before proceeding with the special order. When the special order is ready we would then charge the alteration
	fees and ship the item out to you.
	</p>
	<p>We cannot customize or alter any sale/closeout items.
    </p>

 <!-- removing UPS Standard. 10/30/2013 cw <p><strong>For UPS Canada customers only</strong>: Canada Customs requires Canadian recipients to pay applicable duties and taxes on each shipment entering Canada. These charges may include PST, GST, HST, duties and other taxes of goods (e.g. excise tax). A brokerage fee is also charged to process shipments and present the requisite customs paperwork to Canada Customs on the importer's behalf.
Your order will be shipped under UPS's e-Tailer Brokerage Program (eBP), where eligible shipments imported into Canada for non-commercial purposes and valued under CAD$ 200 shipped via UPS Standard service are subject to a reduced brokerage fee of CAD$ 10, plus any applicable duties and taxes. Shipments valued at CAD$200 and above and/or being imported to Canada for commercial purposes and/or subject to specialized clearance may incur additional fees.
Please, be aware that UPS will request payment of these charges at the time of delivery. You have the ability to call UPS ahead of time (1-800-742-5877) to pay these charges, eliminating the need for payment on delivery.</p> -->

<p style="margin: 10px 15px 10px 15px; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary:</span> Clean your leathers before conditioning
and allow them to air dry.  Use a mink oil based conditioner that does not
contain beeswax or silicone unless you need exceptional waterproofing.</p>

<p style="margin: 15px 5px 15px 5px;">Proper care is important to the longevity of your motorcycle leathers.
Neglected leathers can dry and rot while well cared for leathers will increase
in beauty as they age.  At Fox Creek we use naked leather, which will readily absorb
conditioning oils because there is no finish on its surface.  A well
conditioned set of leathers will attain a beautiful luster that shows off the
natural full grain of the leather.</p>

<p style="margin: 15px 5px 15px 5px;">The basic idea behind leather conditioning is to replace the natural oils
that the leather loses during daily wear.  These oils
lubricate the leather, keeping it supple, and repel water and dirt which can
break down the integrity of your leathers.  All of our jackets, vests and chaps
are treated with mink oil when they are made.  Mink oil is an animal oil and is
easily absorbed by the leather.  It is an excellent conditioner because it
closely resembles the leather's natural oils.</p>

<p style="margin: 15px 5px 15px 5px;">How often you treat your leathers depends on how hard and how often you ride.  
We normally recommend treating your leathers every 3-4 months of active
riding.  However, if conditions are harsh you may find it necessary to do so
more often.  For example, if you are caught in a hard downpour on
a bike that offers little protection from the elements you may wish to
condition your leathers after they dry to replace oils that were lost to the rain.  If you ever notice that your leathers feel dry
or stiff, it is a sign that they need to be conditioned.  It is best to avoid
letting them reach that state.  Over time you will fall into a schedule for
caring for your leathers that is appropriate for your riding habits.</p>

<p style="margin: 15px 5px 15px 5px;">First, clean your leathers before you condition them.  Never
condition dirty or wet leathers, the conditioning oils will trap the water and
dirt in the leather causing it to degrade faster.  If your leathers are not
noticeably soiled, wipe them down with a slightly damp cloth and let them dry at room
temperature overnight.  If your leathers need a more thorough cleaning we
recommend using a cleaner such as <a href="/134.html">Montana Pitch Blend Leather Cleaner</a>. 
Regardless, allow your leathers to air dry completely at room
temperature before you condition them.</p>

<p style="margin: 15px 5px 15px 5px;">Next, choose a conditioner based on your riding needs.  For most people
we recommend <a href="/108.html">Montana Pitch Blend Leather Oil</a>.  It contains only pure mink oil
and pine pitch.  The pine pitch helps to preserve your leathers by acting as an
antimicrobial agent.  It also has a slight pleasing natural pine scent.  <a href="/108.html">Montana Pitch Blend Leather Oil</a> 
provides good waterproofing.</p>

<p style="margin: 15px 5px 15px 5px;">In the case that you need exceptional waterproofing, we recommend 
<a href="/107.html">Montana Pitch Blend Leather Dressing</a>, a mink oil and beeswax blend.  Beeswax and
silicone both waterproof by blocking the pores of your leathers, which can also trap dirt and moisture.
Please take extra care in cleaning and drying your leathers before using either of these products.</p>

<p style="margin: 15px 5px 15px 5px;">To treat your garment spread a small amount of your conditioner of choice on
a soft cloth and gently work it into the leather.  Once you have conditioned the
entire garment allow it to sit for half an hour and fully absorb the conditioner.
At this point you can give your leathers a second application of conditioner if
necessary. If not, wipe off any excess conditioner with a clean dry cloth.</p>

<p style="margin: 15px 5px 15px 5px;">Any of the above conditioners can be used together.  One popular combination is to apply a first coat of <a href="/108.html">Montana Pitch Blend Leather Oil</a> and a second coat of <a href="/107.html">Montana Pitch Blend Leather Dressing</a>.  This thoroughly conditions your garment and adds a little extra waterproofing.</p>

<h3 style="margin: 0px 5px;"> The Original Doc Bailey's Leather Black </h3>

<p style="margin: 15px 5px 15px 5px;"><a href="/761.html">The Original Doc Bailey's Leather Black</a> actually contains a dye pigment that restores lost colour. It also cleans, nourishes and waterproofs. <a href="/761.html">Doc Bailey's Leather Black</a> gently cleans leather with specially formulated detergents which actually lift dirt out, opening the pores of the leather allowing the lanolin oil to flow into the leather nourishing and softening it. <a href="/761.html">Doc Bailey's Leather Black</a> actually penetrates deep into the leather to restores lost colour. As a finishing touch, special waxes lock the colour in which protects and waterproofs your leather.</p>

<p style="margin: 15px 5px 15px 5px;">Apply a small amount of <a href="/761.html">Doc Bailey's Leather Black </a> to a clean, dry sponge and wipe even over the surface to be treated. Rinse sponge after use. Allow to cure for 12 hours before exposing to moisture. Buff for higher shine if desired. Do not use on Buckskin or Suede. Product will darken all leather, always test in a discrete area. Reapply every 6 months or as needed.</p>

<h3 style="margin: 0px 5px;">Leather Therapy</h3>
