<span class="fsl">PRIVACY POLICY<br><br></span></center>

<span class="fsl">Fox Filmed Entertainment (<b>"Fox FE"</b>) is part of the News
America Group, which has adopted a set of <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html">Privacy Principles</a>
applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. Fox FE has implemented those
Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use
and share personally identifiable information (<b>"PII"</b>)
we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S.<br><br>

Children's Privacy Policy:<br><br>

Some of our online activities are directed to children under 13. In
those instances, we provide additional privacy protections. To read
about our protections for children under 13 <a href="#child">click
here</a>.<br><br>

From time to time Fox FE may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect
changes in the law, technology or industry initiatives. Therefore, you
should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most
current policies and practices.<br><br>

1. COLLECTION - COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
("PII") BY FOX FE:<br><br>

(a) General: Fox FE collects personally identifiable information
(<b>"PII"</b> -- that is, information such as your full name,
email address, mailing address or telephone number) only in order to
create or enhance our relationship with you. When we collect PII from
you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us
in order to participate in activities like sweepstakes, contests, games,
surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content or suggestions you
submit to us, chats or bulletin boards, or because you want us to
furnish you with products, services or information. On those occasions
when we obtain PII from a third party, we use only reputable sources of
such information.<br><br>

(b) Cookies: Cookies are small bits of information that the Internet
sites operated by Fox FE place on the hard drive of your computer.
Cookies remember information about your activities on our site(s) and
enable Fox FE to make your visits to our site(s) more enjoyable. For
example, cookies can store your password for easy log-on to a site you
have previously visited, can save your preferences for a personalized
home page or can track the items you have placed in your "shopping
cart" during a visit to our online store. The cookie itself does
not contain PII.<br><br>

Fox FE may use cookies to relate your use of our web site(s) to PII you
have submitted to us. For example, if you've asked us to send you
information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie
information may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items we
know you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities
and preferences. By submitting your information to us, you are expressly
agreeing that we may coordinate personal and cookie or other clickstream
information in this manner (i.e., you have <b>"opted
in"</b>).<br><br>

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being
sent or to refuse cookies completely. However, without cookies you won't
have access to certain features on Fox FE's web site(s), such as
personalization of site content.<br><br>

2. NOTICE - FOX FE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION
PRACTICES:<br><br>

When Fox FE collects PII from you, we will make sure you are informed
about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is
being collected and the types of uses Fox FE will make of the
information.<br><br>

This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send
you information about their products and services and therefore want to
share your personal information (See "Use" below). However, at
the time your PII is collected, Fox FE will notify you of your options
regarding our use of your PII, including whether we can share it with
outside companies (See "Choice" below).<br><br>

Sometimes we collect PII from consumers in manual format, such as a post
card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations
often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a
short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy
and other relevant information from us.<br><br>

Fox FE's web site(s) may be linked to Internet sites operated by other
companies. Although we choose our business partners carefully, Fox FE is
not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third
parties that are linked to our site[s] or for the privacy practices of a
third party. Once you've left a Fox FE site via such a link, you should
check the applicable privacy policy of the third-party site to determine
how they will handle any PII they collect from you.<br><br>

Fox FE's web site(s) may also be linked to sites operated by companies
affiliated with Fox FE. Visitors to those affiliated sites should still
refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ
in some respects from this Policy.<br><br>

3. CHOICE - FOX FE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR
PII:<br><br>

Fox FE will provide you with the opportunity to choose whether your PII
may be used for purposes different from the purpose for which it was
submitted. You will also be able to choose whether your information is
shared with companies that are not affiliated with Fox FE (i.e., not a
part of the News America Group).<br><br>

4. USE - FOX FE'S USE OF PII:<br><br>

Fox FE will use your PII in a manner that is consistent with this Policy
and only for the purpose for which it is submitted, unless other uses
are disclosed at the time of collection and you allow us to use your
information in these other ways.<br><br>

Fox FE may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us,
that is part of the News America Group of companies. Fox FE may also
share your PII with companies that are not affiliated with Fox FE, but
would like to send you information about their products and services.
However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to
share your information with third parties at the time of
collection.<br><br>

Fox FE employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business
reason to obtain access to your PII. Outside contractors or agents who
help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes
administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses) may only use
PII to provide Fox FE with a specific service and not for any other
purpose. Fox FE uses a third party called Reponsys to distribute e-mails
and to collect and store consumer registration information. <a href="http://www.rsvp0.net">Click Here</a> to see Responsys Services
Permission Policy.<br><br>

If Fox FE obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner,
our use of this information is governed by this Policy.<br><br>

Fox FE may be required to disclose PII to comply with legal
requirements, such as a court order, and to protect the safety and
security of visitors to our web sites.<br><br>

5. SECURITY - FOX FE PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII:<br><br>

Fox FE uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical
measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and
unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, Fox FE uses
reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and
appropriately complete.<br><br>

6. ACCESS - HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PII:<br><br>

Visitors may review or delete personal information from our records. If
you would like your personal information deleted, please contact us at
feedbackus@fox.com. We will immediately delete your information from our
database. However, there may be residual information that will remain
within our databases that may or may not contain PII. This residual
information will not be given to any other third party or used for any
commercial purpose.<br><br>

If you would like to review your personal information in our records, or
change any PII previously submitted, please go to <a href="http://FoxSearchlight.rsc03.net/servlet/website/ResponseForm?MrlsEf9epgryLjNLlm">Member
Center</a>.<br><br>

<br><br> <center> <a name="child"></a>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY POLICY<a name="child" href="child"></a></center><br><br>

1. KIDS AND INTERNET SAFETY:<br><br>

Fox Filmed Entertainment (<b>"Fox FE"</b>) is part of the News
America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy Principles applicable
to all its U.S.-based companies. Fox FE has implemented those Principles
in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share
personally identifiable information (<b>"PII"</b>) we obtain
from and about individuals located in the U.S.<br><br>

We at Fox FE understand that the Internet presents an opportunity for us
to reach the public in new and exciting ways with information about our
programming, fun games, exciting sweepstakes and contests, email, chat
rooms, bulletin boards and other forms of interactivity. Fox FE also
recognizes the privacy concerns of parents, and the importance of
protecting the privacy of the information collected from children at the
Foxmovies.com website (<b>"Site"</b>). Parents of children who
visit this Site can be confident that any personal information that may
be provided to this Site will be collected and maintained in accordance
with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
(<b>"COPPA"</b>). Fox FE encourages parents to supervise their
children's activities online and to participate with their children's
online activities whenever possible. However, we understand that parents
may not always be able to supervise their children's activities on the
Internet. That's why Fox FE has developed a Site that parents can feel
is safe for their children and kids will find informative, educational
and fun! Because there's always room for improvement, Fox FE welcomes
any suggestions on how to make the Site a better, safer place to
visit.<br><br>


2. COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
(<b>"PII"</b>) FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13:<br><br>

When a visitor to our Site is under the age of 13, Fox FE does not
require the disclosure of more PII than is reasonably necessary for him
or her to participate in an activity as a condition of such
participation.<br><br>

Fox FE may use different types of PII submitted to this Site by children
under 13 in a variety of ways, which are described below. In each
instance, we comply with the parental consent requirements of
COPPA.<br><br>

(a) Use of a Child's Information by Fox FE:<br><br>

(i) We may collect a child's email address in connection with a contest,
sweepstakes or game for the sole purpose of communicating with the child
on a one-time-only basis (i.e., to contact a sweepstakes winner). This
information will not be used to re-contact the child, and will be
deleted from our records when the contest or game is over. Parental
consent is obtained before we send the winner a prize.<br><br>

(ii) We may collect a child's email address in order to respond more
than once to a child's specific request. For example, the child may want
to subscribe to an online newsletter or receive other online
communications from Fox FE. In these instances Fox FE will also obtain a
parent's email address along with the child's. Before any further
contact with the child, Fox FE will send an email to the parent (A)
notifying him or her we have collected the child's email address in
order to respond more than once to the child's request for a
subscription, information, etc.; (B) informing the parent that he or she
can refuse us permission to contact the child, and how to do so; and (C)
informing the parent that if he or she does not respond to the email
within one (1) week, Fox FE may use the child's information for the
purpose for which it was submitted. Under no circumstances will the
child be allowed to participate without giving a parent's email
address.<br><br>

(iii) We may collect a child's PII (including name, email address,
mailing address and phone number) for such activities as chats, forums,
surveys, games, bulletin boards, requests for suggestions, subscription
registrations, content submissions, requests for products or services,
or requests for additional information. In these instances we will
initially collect only the child's name and online contact information
and the email address of the child's parent. Before using this
information for any purpose, we will send the parent an email that (A)
informs the parent that we wish to collect and use the child's personal
information and need the parent's consent to do so, and (B) provides the
parent with a link to access this Privacy Policy, which describes our
information collection and use policies as required by COPPA. Fox FE
will ask the parent to provide consent by return email. Upon receipt of
the email consent, we will send the parent a confirming email. Fox FE
will only use the child's PII for internal purposes and will not share
it with any third party.<br><br>

(iv) We may collect a child's name and email address to the extent
reasonably necessary to protect the security of this Site, to protect
against liability or as required or permitted by law. Information
collected for these reasons will not be used for any other
purpose.<br><br>

(b) Sharing Children's Personal Information with Third Parties: Parents
must affirmatively consent to the disclosure of their child's personal
information to any third party, including Fox-affiliated companies that
are not part of Fox FE. Parents may consent to Fox FE's collection and
use of a child's personal information without consenting to the
disclosure of the information to third parties.<br><br>

3. LINKS/CO-BRANDED SITES:<br><br>

This Site may link directly to sites operated by Fox FE's advertisers,
business partners and affiliated companies. Those sites, which are not
controlled by Fox FE, may collect personal information from your child.
Parents should therefore check the relevant site's privacy policy to
understand how it collects and uses children's personal information. Fox
FE will not share any personal information obtained by another site from
a child under the age of 13 unless that site follows the requirements of
COPPA.<br><br>

4. REVIEWING AND MAKING CHANGES TO PII COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN UNDER
13:<br><br>

Parents of children under age 13 may review or delete personal
information about their children from our records at any time. If you
would like your child's personal information deleted, please contact us
at <a href="mailto:weekendread@foxsearchlight.com">weekendread@foxsearchlight.com</a>. We will
immediately delete your child's information from our database and
refrain from collecting any other PII from your child, if you so
request.<br><br>

If you would like to review the personal information in our records
submitted by your child, or change any PII previously submitted by your
child, please go to <a href="http://FoxSearchlight.rsc03.net/servlet/website/ResponseForm?MrlsEf9epgryLjNLlm">Member
Center</a> and follow the instructions.<br><br>
