          Fox FE collects personally identifiable information (<b>"PII"</b> 
          -- that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing 
          address or telephone number) only in order to create or enhance our

          are voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to participate 
          in activities like sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription 
          registrations, content or suggestions you submit to us, chats or bulletin 
          boards, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services 
          or information. On those occasions when we obtain PII from a third party, 
          we use only reputable sources of such information.</font></p>

          information about your activities on our site(s) and enable Fox FE to 
          make your visits to our site(s) more enjoyable. For example, cookies

          track the items you have placed in your "shopping cart" during

          to relate your use of our web site(s) to PII you have submitted to us. 
          For example, if you've asked us to send you information about our upcoming

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">When Fox FE collects 
          PII from you, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting 
          the information, how and why the information is being collected and 
          the types of uses Fox FE will make of the information.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">This Policy describes 
          the types of other companies that may want to send you information about 
          their products and services and therefore want to share your personal 
          information (See "Use" below). However, at the time your PII 
          is collected, Fox FE will notify you of your options regarding our use 
          of your PII, including whether we can share it with outside companies 
          (See "Choice" below).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Sometimes we collect 
          PII from consumers in manual format, such as a post card or subscription 
          form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, 
          so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes 
          how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information 
          from us.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Fox FE's web site(s) 
          may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Although 
          we choose our business partners carefully, Fox FE is not responsible 
          for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that 
          are linked to our site[s] or for the privacy practices of a third party. 
          Once you've left a Fox FE site via such a link, you should check the 
          applicable privacy policy of the third-party site to determine how they 
          will handle any PII they collect from you.</font></p>

          you with the opportunity to choose whether your PII may be used for 
          purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted. You 
          will also be able to choose whether your information is shared with 
          companies that are not affiliated with Fox FE (i.e., not a part of the

          these other ways.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Fox FE may share 
          your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is part of

          with companies that are not affiliated with Fox FE, but would like to 
          send you information about their products and services. However, you 
          will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information

          our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration, order 
          fulfillment, statistical analyses) may only use PII to provide Fox FE 
          with a specific service and not for any other purpose.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">If Fox FE obtains 
          PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of this

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Fox FE may be required

        reach the public in new and exciting ways with information about our programming, 
        fun games, exciting sweepstakes and contests, email, chat rooms, bulletin 
        boards and other forms of interactivity. Fox FE also recognizes the privacy 
        concerns of parents, and the importance of protecting the privacy of the 
        information collected from children at the Foxmovies.com website (<b>"Site"</b>). 
        Parents of children who visit this Site can be confident that any personal 
        information that may be provided to this Site will be collected and maintained 
        in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (<b>"COPPA"</b>). 
        Fox FE encourages parents to supervise their children's activities online 
        and to participate with their children's online activities whenever possible. 
        However, we understand that parents may not always be able to supervise 
        their children's activities on the Internet. That's why Fox FE has developed 
        a Site that parents can feel is safe for their children and kids will 
        find informative, educational and fun! Because there's always room for 
        improvement, Fox FE welcomes any suggestions on how to make the Site a 
        better, safer place to visit.</font></p>
