<p>This is the Privacy Policy of FOXTEL. FOXTEL is comprised of FOXTEL Cable Television Pty Limited (ACN 069 008 797), FOXTEL Management Pty Limited (ACN 068 671 938) (agent for the FOXTEL Partnership) and Customer Services Pty Limited (ACN 069 272 117).</p>
<h1 class="pageHead">Commitment to Privacy</h1> 
<p>FOXTEL takes its privacy obligations seriously. This includes protecting your privacy. FOXTEL is bound by new sections of the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988 which set out a number of principles concerning the protection of personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how, when and why FOXTEL will collect, use, disclose and store your personal information. There are two circumstances where FOXTEL may use or disclose your personal information in a way other than as set out in this policy:</p>
<ol>
<li>where you consent to FOXTEL doing so; and</li> 
<li>where such use or disclosure is authorised by law.</li>
</ol>
<h1 class="pageHead">Who is FOXTEL?</h1>
<p>In this Privacy Policy, we use the term FOXTEL Group. This includes FOXTEL, Telstra Multimedia Pty Limited (ACN 669 279 072) (the owner of the cable) (TMPL), FOXTEL's business partners, the FOXTEL Partnership and the FOXTEL Television Partnership. FOXTEL's business partners include Telstra Corporation Limited (ACN 051 775 556) (Telstra), News Corporation Limited (ACN 007 910 330) (News), and Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (ACN 009 071 671) (PBL). The FOXTEL Partnership and the FOXTEL Television Partnership are partnerships between entities owned by Telstra, News and PBL. We also use the term Authorised Third Parties. This describes the contractors, agents and third party suppliers with whom FOXTEL or other members of the FOXTEL Group enter into agreements from time to time and persons with whom they may contract in order to provide the FOXTEL service.</p>
<h1 class="pageHead">Collection of Personal Information</h1>
<p>FOXTEL needs certain personal information to provide its services to subscribers. If you provide inaccurate or incomplete information we may not be able to provide you with the FOXTEL service.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you schedule your connection to the FOXTEL service, FOXTEL may collect such personal information as your name, address, telephone numbers, the particular service you require, your household viewing interests, bank account and credit card details and billing preferences.</li> 
<li>After you become a subscriber, FOXTEL may collect such personal information as your payment history, when you take up additional services or pay-per-view events, when you contact FOXTEL about the service, and when you enter into subscriber competitions.</li>
<li>FOXTEL may also collect other personal information relating to you or provided by you in connection with the FOXTEL service.</li> 
</ol>
<p>FOXTEL may also collect personal information when you make an inquiry about the FOXTEL service, for example, when you ask us to send information or contact you about FOXTEL. When you make such an enquiry, FOXTEL only collects your name, address, telephone numbers, email address and household viewing interests and will always enquire whether you are happy for us to maintain a record of that information to use for marketing. FOXTEL does not collect sensitive information about your political, philosophical or religious beliefs, your ethnicity, sexual preferences or health information. However, if you have special health requirements, you may voluntarily provide us with that information in order for us to better provide the FOXTEL service. FOXTEL also collects information regarding activity on its website, such as the number of visitors to the website, the date and time of those visits, the number of pages viewed and navigation patterns. This information does not personally identify you. It is obtained using 'cookies' which are frequently used by websites to identify users' computers. This information on its own does not identify an individual but it provides FOXTEL with statistics that we can use to analyse and improve our website and the FOXTEL service. This information is collected on FOXTEL's behalf by Red Sheriff, located at www.redsheriff.com. FOXTEL may also collect personal information about you from a third party, such as from a list rental company for the purpose of telemarketing and direct marketing.</p> 
<h1 class="pageHead">Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</h1>
<p>FOXTEL will not sell, rent or trade your personal information. As mentioned above, FOXTEL uses and discloses personal information (including to the FOXTEL Group) in connection with providing the FOXTEL service. Examples of such uses by FOXTEL or members of the FOXTEL Group are:</p>
<ol>
<li>providing the services to you;</li> 
<li>informing you of channels and channel packages, answering queries, making appointments for installation and service calls, billing, arranging replacement of lost or damaged equipment;</li> 
<li>assisting to maintain the integrity of the FOXTEL system from signal piracy and theft;</li> 
<li>undertaking subscriber care activities; and</li> 
<li>planning, research and product development.</li>
</ol> 
<p>Your personal information may also be used or disclosed to enable FOXTEL to ensure that you perform your obligations regarding the provision of the FOXTEL service, including payment of your subscription fee and other fees, returning the FOXTEL equipment and any other obligation as set out in your agreement with FOXTEL. FOXTEL may also use and disclose your personal information in its measures for detecting and preventing fraudulent activity The law also allows FOXTEL to use and disclose your personal information for a purpose related to those specified above in circumstances where you would reasonably expect FOXTEL to do so. FOXTEL relies on other members of the FOXTEL Group and Authorised Third Parties to conduct specialised activities such as installations, mail-outs, disconnections, information technology services, debt collection, tele-marketing and door-to-door sales. These activities may involve the use and disclosure of your personal information by FOXTEL to other members of the FOXTEL Group, and Authorised Third Parties. However:</p>
<ol>
<li>other members of the FOXTEL Group may only use your personal information for their own commercial purposes, in the circumstances, described below; and</li> 
<li>the Authorised Third Parties do not have authority to use your personal information for their own commercial purposes, and FOXTEL will take all reasonable steps to deal only with Authorised Third Parties that share and demonstrate the same attitudes to privacy as FOXTEL.</li>
</ol> 
<p>Unless you inform us otherwise:</p> 
<ol>
<li>FOXTEL may use and disclose your personal information for promotion and marketing of its products and services to you; and</li> 
<li>FOXTEL may disclose your personal information to FOXTEL's business partners and may be used or disclosed by those partners for planning, research, product development, promotion and marketing in relation to their products and services.</li> 
</ol>
<p>FOXTEL will use reasonable steps to ensure that the use and disclosure of your information by its business partners is consistent with privacy laws. Neither FOXTEL nor FOXTEL's business partners will use your personal information in the two ways described above, if you let FOXTEL know that you do not want them to do so by phoning 131 999.</p> 
<h1 class="pageHead">Accuracy of Your Personal Information</h1>
<p>FOXTEL aims to ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete and up-to-date. To assist with this, please contact us if your details change. If you believe the information we have about you is not accurate, please contact us and we will take all reasonable steps to correct or update the information.</p> 
<h1 class="pageHead">Security of Your Personal Information</h1>
<p>FOXTEL is committed to keeping your personal information secure and will take all reasonable precautions to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, misuse or alteration. FOXTEL stores your personal information in electronic form on a subscriber management database. The database is secure and can only be accessed by authorised users. Any hard copies of personal information kept by FOXTEL, will be secure and accessible only by authorised personnel. FOXTEL may also archive hardcopy information in secure premises operated by an Authorised Third Party. FOXTEL will take all reasonable steps to protect the personal information you transmit to us using our website however, FOXTEL cannot guarantee the security of such information because data transmissions over the Internet are never totally secure.</p>  
<h1 class="pageHead">Access to Personal Information</h1>
<p>Upon your request, FOXTEL will provide you with copies of any personal information it holds about you. However, before FOXTEL does so, it may be necessary for you to prove your identity. You may be charged a fee that will reflect our reasonable administrative, posting and handling costs. FOXTEL is not obliged to provide you with access to this personal information if:</p>
<ol>
<li>it would pose a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of an individual;</li> 
<li>it would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals;</li> 
<li>the request is frivolous or vexatious;</li> 
<li>the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between FOXTEL and you, and the information would not be required to be provided to you in those proceedings;</li> 
<li>it would reveal the intentions of FOXTEL in relation to negotiations with you in such a way as to prejudice those negotiations;</li> 
<li>it would be unlawful, may prejudice an investigation of possible unlawful activity, may prejudice enforcement of laws, or denying access is specifically authorised by law; or</li> 
<li>it would reveal evaluative information generated within FOXTEL in connection with a commercially sensitive decision making process.</li>
</ol> 
<p>FOXTEL will provide you with reasons if it declines your request for access to your personal information.</p> 
<h1 class="pageHead">Privacy of Children's Personal Information</h1>
<p>The protection of children's personal information is very important to FOXTEL. FOXTEL requires that children under the age of 18 have a parent or guardian verify and consent to any personal information we collect from the child. FOXTEL will make every reasonable effort to ensure that children's privacy is protected however FOXTEL believes that parents must take full responsibility for monitoring their children's use of the FOXTEL service.</p>
