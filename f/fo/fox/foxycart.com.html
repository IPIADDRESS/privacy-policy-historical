		<h1 id="h1" class="bg_red_1">Privacy Policy</h1>
		
	<h2>Overview</h2>

	<p>This privacy statement covers the Web pages belonging to FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span> in the United States. It does not cover the privacy policies of FoxyCart users (stores using FoxyCart’s services). For the purposes of this privacy policy, “you” shall refer to the FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span> customer (“user”), and not user’s customers. For information on the “user’s customers” please see the “Stores Using FoxyCart” section.</p>

	<p>At FoxyCart, privacy on the Internet means that:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>FoxyCart informs you how we use any personally identifiable information that is submitted to us online.</li>
		<li>FoxyCart maintains confidentiality and security safeguards for personally identifiable information.</li>
		<li>You have control over the personally identifiable information you decide to submit to FoxyCart.</li>
		<li>If you have elected to receive email promotions from FoxyCart, you can opt-out from these at any time.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We respect your privacy, and will not share, sell, or otherwise disclose your personal information to disclose this information to affiliates, subsidiaries, agents, or third party content providers for marketing purposes. FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span> retains the right to disclose any information necessary to normal business operation, such as to payment processors.</p>

	<p>The websites of our users (stores using FoxyCart’s services) may have different privacy policies and practices from those disclosed here, and we encourage you to become familiar with them as necessary. This site is operated by FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span> in the United States. By using this website, you understand and agree that (1) the information collected from this site may be retained indefinitely, and may be stored, accessed, and used in jurisdictions whose privacy laws may be different and less protective than those of your home jurisdiction; and (2) FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span> may use this information for a variety of purposes including direct marketing (unless you opt out of receiving direct marketing from FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span>).</p>

	<p>FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span> will not use information not provided directly to FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span> (www.foxycart.com, forum.foxycart.com, wiki.foxycart.com, or any future sites controlled directly by FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span>).

	<h2>Stores Using FoxyCart</h2>

	<p><strong>This privacy policy does not apply to sites <em>using</em> FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span>’s services.</strong> Stores using FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span>’s services may have their own privacy policies. FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span> will not use any customer information that is not provided to FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span> directly. In other words, if a business named “Ketchup Popsicles” uses FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span>’s services, Ketchup Popsicle’s customers:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>will be processed through FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span>’s services and servers as necessary to complete the transaction, which may include:
	<ul>
		<li>logging the customer IP and other network information,</li>
		<li>setting cookies,</li>
		<li>sending the customer information to the payment gateways that are configured by the store admin;</li>
		<li>sending the customer by encrypted <span class="caps">XML</span> to the <span class="caps">URL</span> specified in the FoxyCart store admin;</li>
	</ul></li>
		<li>will receive whatever email receipts are configured in the FoxyCart admin;</li>
		<li>will have their information stored on FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span>’s servers, as necessary to provide transaction history reports to Ketchup Popsicles’ store administrator;</li>
		<li>will <em>not</em> be contacted by FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span> or any representative of FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span> without explicit approval from Ketchup Popsicles (ie. for troubleshooting or bug diagnosis);</li>
		<li>will <em>not</em> be used for direct marketing by FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span> or any representative of FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span>;</li>
		<li>will <em>not</em> have their information shared, sold, or otherwise disclosed, unless FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span> is required by law to do so;</li>
		<li>may be used in an anonymous, aggregatred format to calculate statistics for FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span>’s services (ie. average transaction value, average transactions per store, average transactions per day per store, etc.), which may be used for both internal purposes (analyzing server load, etc.) and external purposes (marketing, etc.).</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>What We Collect</h2>

	<p>When you visit this website, some information, such as the site that referred you to us, your IP and email address, and navigational and purchase information, may be collected automatically as part of the site’s operation. This information is used to generate user profiles and to personalize the web site to your particular interests. On some occasions we may ask you to provide information on online forms. For example, we may ask for your user name, password, place of birth, full name, telephone number, email address and postal address, or other information to register online, or for your credit card number or other personally identifying information to fulfill licensing transactions or to receive products or services.</p>

	<p>Whenever you are asked to provide personal information, we will notify you of the purposes for taking such information, usually at the point when the information is collected. Providing information on online forms is always voluntary, and you are free not to complete any online forms. If you choose not to, however, some products and services may not be available to you. We will let you know when certain information is required to carry out the service requested, usually by placing an asterisk or some other designation next to required information (or by letting you know when certain information requested is optional).</p>

	<h2>How We Use It</h2>

	<p>The information collected online is stored indefinitely and is used for various purposes, including processing your transactions, customer service, product and service development, responding to your inquiries, direct marketing and marketing analysis and facilitating your use of this website.

	<h2>Your Choices</h2>

	<p>Unless you opt out of receiving promotional materials from us, we may notify you of special promotions, new products or services, or other information that may be of interest.

	<h2>Other Disclosures</h2>

	<p>We also reserve the right to disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or protect the rights, property or safety of our company, employees, customers or the public.</p>

	<h2>Cookies</h2>

	<p>When you visit FoxyCart.com, we may place a text file, called a cookie, in the browser directory of your computer’s hard drive. A cookie is a small piece of information that a website can store on your web browser and later retrieve. Cookies do not contain your personal information. The information that cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit, your registration information and your navigational and purchase activity. Cookies offer you many conveniences. They allow FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span>, and certain third party content providers, to recognize information, and so can determine what content is best suited to your needs. Cookies also allow you to retrieve previous image search results and view your previous invoices. The domain name of the site server transmitting the cookies is FoxyCart.com.</p>

	<p>Most browsers allow you to decline cookies, but if you elect to do so, these pages may not display properly. While cookies will be stored in your hard drive for your next visit with us, you are free to delete cookies after your session, and your browser should contain instructions on how to do this.</p>

	<h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>

	<p>The sites to which we link, including but not limited to the sites of third party content providers, may have different privacy policies and practices from those disclosed here. These other websites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data or solicit personal information. We assume no responsibility for the policies or practices of linked sites and encourage you to become acquainted with them.</p>

	<h2>Safeguarding Your Information</h2>

	<p>FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span> uses reasonable precautions to keep your personal information secure from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of third parties.</p>

	<h2>Policy Regarding Minors</h2>

	<p>Under no circumstances does this privacy policy override any provisions or agreements set forth in any of FoxyCart.com <span class="caps">LLC</span>’s Terms of Service or Acceptable Use Policies. The Terms of Service or the Acceptable Use Policy will be used instead of this privacy policy if conflicting statements are discovered.</p>
