Such additional processing will be carried out with your consent, if such consent is required by applicable law, or on the basis of Fox’s legitimate interest in maintaining applicants’ records to facilitate recruiting within its global operations; such legitimate interest is adequately balanced with your interest in being considered for other positions that may suit and interest you.
