<h4>Activity Information Collection: Cookies and Similar Technologies</h4>
<p class="bod">
    When you access and interact with the Careers Site, Fox and its service providers may collect certain information about those visits.  For example, in order to permit your connection to the Careers Site, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.  If you access the Careers Site from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, or other transactional information for that device.  Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier.  Our websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service.  These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Careers Site, such as pages you have visited. 
</p>
<p class="bod">
    Third parties that support the Careers Site by providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Careers Site or third-party services.  Fox does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.  
</p>
<p class="bod">
    Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.

</p>
<p class="bod">

</p>
<h4>Access and Correction</h4>
<p class="bod">
    If you register on the Careers Site, you may access, review, and change your personal information stored therein by logging into the Careers Site and updating your account information.

<p class="bod">
    We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect personal information within our organization.
