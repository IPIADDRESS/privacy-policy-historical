        <p>The information that you submit on the Careers Sites will be used <u><strong>to consider your application for the specific position you applied for</strong></u> and in particular to: (a) process your application; (b) to assess your capabilities and qualifications for a job; and (c) to respond to your inquiries and communicate with you about your application.</p>

    </p><p>Please note, that your personal information also will be <u><strong>used for Fox’s personnel recruiting function, should your profile be suitable for positions other than the one for which you applied</strong></u>. In such case, the information about you will be added to Fox’s candidate database and may be used to consider you for opportunities at Fox and its affiliates other than the one(s) for which you applied. If you no longer wish to be considered for other positions within Fox, contact us by email or mail using the details in the <em>“Contact Us”</em> section below. </p>
        <p>Finally, your personal data may be used by Fox to complete a corporate transaction, such as a proposed or actual reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of Fox’s businesses, assets, or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).  </p>

        <a name="disclosure"></a>
        <h2 class="h4">Disclosure of Personal Information </h2>
        <p>Fox may share personal information with its <strong>Fox affiliates</strong> that are involved in evaluating candidates for a given position. Fox will make the information available to personnel with a business need to know the information, including personnel in the recruiting, human resources and information technology departments, and in the department responsible for the position(s) for which you are applying or for which you are being considered. For a list of our company affiliates that may process your information, please contact: <a href="mailto:FoxCareersPrivacy@fox.com">FoxCareersPrivacy@fox.com</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="h4">Data Retention </h2>
        <p>We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.  </p>
        <p>Remember that even after you cancel your account or delete your personal information, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances.  For example, because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others.  We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation or deletion, for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security or recordkeeping policies. It may not always be possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints or, contractual, financial or legal requirements. </p>


        <a name="activity"></a>
        <h2 class="h4">Activity Information Collection: Cookies and Similar Technologies </h2>
        <p>When you access and interact with the Careers Sites, Fox and its service providers may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Careers Sites, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Careers Sites from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, or other information for that device. Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) are comprised of small bits of data that often include a unique identifier. Our websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Careers Sites, such as pages you have visited. By collecting and using this data, we hope to improve the quality of the Careers Sites.</p>
        <p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.

        <p>Third parties that support the Careers Site by providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Careers Site or third-party services. Fox does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.</p>
        <p><strong>Do Not Track Signals.</strong> At this time, we do not respond to browser 'Do Not Track' signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.</p>

        <a name="access"></a>
        <h2 class="h4">Access and Correction</h2>
        <p>If you register on the Careers Sites, you may access, review, change, and/or delete the personal information you provided by logging into the Careers Sites and updating your account information.
