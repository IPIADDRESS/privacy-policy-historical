      <p>COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION BY FOX</p>
      </b><p><b>General.</b>
 Personally identifiable information about visitors to
      this Site (that is, information such as a visitor’s name, email address,
      mailing address, or telephone number) is collected only when knowingly and
      voluntarily submitted. Such information may be requested in connection
      with our sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription
      registrations, content submissions, chats, bulletin boards, requests for
      suggestions, visitors’ requests for products or services, and visitors’
      requests for additional information.</p>
      <p><b>Joint Collection of Personal Information.</b> Sometimes Fox collects
      personal information jointly with business partners or sponsors. The
      identity of the entities collecting personal information will be clear at
      the time your personal information is collected. A detailed description of
      shared use can also be found in the specific Terms of Use for this Site,
      and in the rules for sweepstakes and promotions. </p><b>
      <p>WHAT FOX DOES (AND DOESN’T DO) WITH THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE
      COLLECT</p>
      </b><p><b>General.</b>
 Fox uses personally identifiable information only for
      the purpose for which it is submitted unless we disclose other uses at the
      time of collection, in which case you will have the opportunity to
      instruct us not to use your data in other ways.</p><p><b>Sharing Personal Information.
      </b> Fox may share personally identifiable
      information with other Fox companies or with some of our business partners
      who would like to send you information about their products or services.
      However, when we collect your information you will have the opportunity to
      instruct us not to share your information in these ways. </p>
      <p><b>LINKS/CO-BRANDED SITES</b>
 </p>
      <p>Fox has established relationships with advertisers and reputable
      business partners that allow visitors to our Site to link directly to
      sites operated by these partners. Some of these sites may be "co-branded"
      with a Fox logo; however, they are not operated or maintained by Fox.
      These sites may collect personal information from you. This Privacy Policy
      will apply to any personal information we obtain in this manner from our
      partners. </p>
      <p>Fox chooses its advertisers and business partners carefully. However,
      Fox is not responsible for the content or practices of Web sites operated
      by third parties that are linked to our Site. These links are meant for
      the user's convenience only. Links to third party sites do not constitute
      sponsorship, endorsement or approval by Fox of the content, policies or
      practices of such third party sites. We are not responsible for any
      information these sites may obtain and do not oversee their policies or
      practices in collecting personal information. Therefore, once you have
      left this Site via such a link, you should check the applicable privacy
      policy of the third party site. </p>
      <p>This Site may also be linked to Web sites operated by companies
      affiliated with Fox. </p>
      <p>Fox may share information collected by our affiliated companies;
      however this Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information we
      receive in this manner. Visitors to our affiliated sites should still
      refer to their separate privacy policies and practices when providing any
      personally identifiable information.</p><b>
      <p>NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</p></b>
      <p>When visitors come to our Site, we collect and aggregate information
      indicating, among other things, which web pages were visited, the order in
      which they were visited, and which hyperlinks, if any, were "clicked" by
      the visitor. Collecting such information involves the logging of IP
      addresses, operating system (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), type of browser
      software (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), and Internet
      service providers (e.g., AOL or Earthlink.net) used by each visitor to the
      Site. Although such information is not personally identifiable, it
      can be used to determine the IP address of the visitor’s Internet Service
      Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity
      to the Internet. </p>
      <p>Cookies are small bits of information that our site places on the hard
      drive of your computer to enable us to do a number of things to make your
      visit and future visits to the site more enjoyable. For example, cookies
      allow a visitor to quickly log on to a site he/she has used before by
      storing a password. Cookies are not used to obtain information about a
      user that was not previously provided in a cookie. The cookie itself does
      not contain any personally identifiable information about a visitor, and
      Fox does not use cookies in order to obtain such information. Fox will
      never save credit card information in cookies. Cookies are used by most
      major sites of the Internet. Visitors may receive cookies from third
      parties, but Fox cannot control the content of these cookies. You should
      consult your browser owner’s manual for instructions on how to refuse
      cookies.</p>
      <p>Fox uses non-personally identifiable information and information
      obtained through the use of cookies in order to improve the Site. By
      tracking how many people visit our Site and where visitors go on our Site,
      we are able to determine which part of the Site users like the best, which
      part needs some improvement and what changes should be made. By obtaining
      this information, we are able to continually improve our Site and bring
      you the best online experience possible. Fox may also disclose some of
      non-personal information we obtain to advertisers to inform them of how
      many people have seen or linked to their advertisements on our Site.
      However, we will never disclose personally identifiable information to
      these advertisers.</p><b>
      <p>REVIEWING AND MAKING CHANGES TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

      <p>Visitors may review or delete personal information from our records at

      personally identifiable information from you child, if you so request.
      However, there may be residual information that will remain within our

      This residual information will not be given to any other third party or
      used for any commercial purpose.</font></p><font face="arial" size="2">

      <p>KIDS AND INTERNET SAFETY</p></b>
      <p>We at Fox understand that the Internet presents an opportunity for us
      to reach the public in new and exciting ways with information about our
      programming, fun games, exciting sweepstakes and contests, email, chat
      rooms, bulletin boards, and other forms of interactivity. Fox also
      recognizes the privacy concerns of parents, and the importance of
      protecting the privacy of the information this Site collects from
      children. Parents of children who visit this Site can be confident that
      any personal information that may be provided to this Site will be
      collected and maintained in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy
      Protection Act ("COPPA"). Fox encourages parents to supervise their
      children’s activities online and to participate with their children’s
      online activities whenever possible. However, we understand that parents
      may not always be able to supervise their children’s activities on the
      Internet. That’s why Fox has developed a Site that parents can feel is
      safe for their children and kids will find cool, informative, educational,
      and fun! Because there’s always room for improvement, Fox welcomes any
      suggestions on how to make the Site a better, <i>safer</i> place to hang
      out.</p>
      <p>Section I of this Privacy Policy applies to the collection of personal
      information from all visitors to this site, regardless of age. Section II
      describes the special, <i>additional</i> policies Fox applies to the
      collection, use and disclosure of personal information submitted to this
      Site by children under 13.</p><b>
      <p>COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN
      UNDER 13</p></b>
      <p>When a visitor to our Site is under the age of 13, Fox does not require
      the disclosure of more personally identifiable information than is
      reasonably necessary for him or her to participate in an activity as a
      condition of such participation. </p>
      <p>Fox may use different types of personally identifiable information
      submitted to this Site by children under 13 in a variety of ways, which
      are described below. In each instance, we comply with the parental consent
      requirements of COPPA.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><b>A. Use of a Child’s Information by Fox</b></p>
      <ul>
          <li>We may collect a child’s email address in connection with a
          contest, sweepstakes or game for the sole purpose of communicating
          with the child on a one-time-only basis (i.e., to contact a contest
          winner). This information will not be used to re-contact the child,
          and will be deleted from our records when the contest or game is over.
          Parental consent is obtained before we send the winner a
      prize.</li></ul>
      <ul>
          <li>We may collect a child’s email address in order to respond more
          than once to a child’s specific request. For example, the child may
          want to subscribe to an online newsletter or receive other online
          communications from Fox. In these instances Fox will also obtain a
          parent’s email address along with the child’s. Before any further
          contact with the child, Fox will send an email to the parent (a)
          notifying him or her we have collected the child’s email address in
          order to respond more than once to the child’s request for a
          subscription, information, etc; (b) informing the parent that he or
          she can refuse us permission to contact the child, and how to do so;
          and (c) informing the parent that if he or she does not respond to the
          email within one (1) week, Fox may use the child’s information for the
          purpose for which it was submitted.</li></ul>
      <ul>
          <li>We may collect a child’s personally identifiable information
          (including name, email address, mailing address and phone number) for
          such activities as chats, forums, surveys, games, bulletin boards,
          requests for suggestions, subscription registrations, content
          submissions, requests for products or services, or requests for
          additional information. In these instances we will initially collect
          only the child’s name and online contact information and the email
          address of the child’s parent. Before using this information for any
          purpose, we will send the parent an email that (a) informs the parent
          that we wish to collect and use the child’s personal information and
          need the parent’s consent to do so, and (b) provides the parent with a
          link to access to this Privacy Policy, which describes our information
          collection and use policies as required by COPPA. If the proposed use
          of the child’s personal information does not involve disclosure to a
          third party, then Fox will ask the parent to provide consent by return
          email. Upon receipt of the email consent, we will send the parent a
          confirming email. If the proposed use of the child’s personal
          information involves disclosure to third parties, the email we send to
          the parent will ask the parent either to (i) return by postal mail or
          fax a consent form that will be attached to the email, or (ii) call a
          toll free number where consent can be given over the phone. If
          parental consent is not obtained by one of these methods within two
          (2) weeks, Fox will delete all of the child’s and parent’s personally
          identifiable information from its records. In addition, parents can
          revoke a prior consent at any time.</li></ul>
      <ul>
          <li>We may collect a child’s name and email address to the extent
          reasonably necessary to protect the security of this Site, to protect
          against liability or as required or permitted by law. Information
          collected for these reasons will not be used for any other
          purpose.</li></ul>
      <p><b>B. Sharing Children’s Personal Information With Third Parties.</b> Fox
      may share a child’s personal information with affiliated Fox companies
      for<b> </b>research and marketing purposes. These third parties have
      agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the
      personal information they obtain from Fox. As noted above, parents may
      exercise their option not to consent to the disclosure of their child’s
      personal information to third parties. Parents may consent to Fox’s
      collection and use of a child’s personal information without consenting to
      the disclosure of the information to third parties. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <b>
      <p>LINKS/CO-BRANDED SITES</p></b>
      <p>As noted in Section I of this Privacy Policy, this Site may link
      directly to sites operated by Fox’s advertisers, business partners and
      affiliated companies. Those sites, which are not controlled by Fox, may
      collect personal information from your child. Parents should therefore
      check the relevant site’s privacy policy to understand how it collects and
      uses children’s personal information. Fox will not share in any personal
      information obtained by a site from a child under the age of 13 unless
      that site follows the requirements of COPPA.</p><b>
      <p>REVIEWING AND MAKING CHANGES TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
      COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13</p></b>
      <p>Parents of children under age 13 may review or delete personal
      information about their children from our records at any time. If you
      would like your child’s personal information deleted, please contact us at
      <font face="arial" size="2"><a href="mailto:remove@registration.foxhome.com">remove@registration.foxhome.com</a></font>. We will immediately delete your

      other personally identifiable information from your child, if you so
      request. However, there may be residual information that will remain
      within our databases that may or may not contain personally identifiable
      information. This residual information will not be given to any other
      third party or used for any commercial purpose.</p>
      <p>If you would like to review the personal information in our records
