<p><b>Introductory Note</b>:</p>
<p>At FoxyApp.com (Foxy App), we understand the importance of safeguarding any information that you may provide to us in the course of using our products and services. Furthermore, we appreciate your choice to share certain information with us as it enables us to improve our products and services. We understand our role in safeguarding your data, and take this role seriously. As such, we follow two relentless principles. First, user data collection should be limited to the extent necessary to enable the proper functioning of a given product or service. Second, user data collection, sharing, and use should be transparent.</p>
<p>Our data collection, sharing, and use policies, as set forth below, were crafted in furtherance of the two principles enumerated above. Should you have any questions or concerns about any privacy-related issues, or the subject matter of the Privacy Policy, please do not hesitate to get in touch with us at the following Email address: Info@Foxyapp.com</p>
<p><b>I. What does this Privacy Policy cover? </b></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy governs your use of the software gaming application, created by Foxy App, (the �Application�). The Application includes features relating to fictitious racing of automobiles, earning points related thereto, and sharing of game results. This Privacy Policy pertains solely to Foxy App.</p>
<p><b>II. What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</b></p>
<p>A. User Provided Information</p>

<p><b>IV. Automatic Data Collection and Advertising.</b></p>
<p>We work with analytics companies to help us understand how the Application is being used, such as the frequency, nature, and duration of usage.</p>
<p>We work with advertisers and third party advertising networks, who need to know how you interact with advertising provided in the Application, which helps us keep the Application free to download. Advertisers and advertising networks may use some of the information collected by the Application. To protect the anonymity of this information, we use encryption technology to help ensure that these third parties can�t identify you personally.</p>
<p>These third parties may also obtain anonymous information about other applications you�ve downloaded to your mobile device, the mobile websites you visit, your non-precise location information (e.g., your zip code), and other non-precise location information in order to help analyze and serve anonymous targeted advertising on the Application and elsewhere. We may also share encrypted versions of information you have provided in order to enable our partners to append other available information about you for analysis or advertising related use.</p>
