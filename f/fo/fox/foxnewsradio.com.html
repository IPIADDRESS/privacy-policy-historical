For example, in order to permit your connection to the Fox News Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, location (including your precise location), browser type, cookies, and other software or hardware information.Our websites use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, localStorage, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including “Flash” cookies) to store or transmit small pieces of data, such as IP address, account information, unique identifiers, and other information. Our websites use these technologies to remember your browser, distinguish you from other users, deliver our services to you as described in this Privacy Policy, and for interest-based advertising. If you access the Fox News Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier associated with the device or other information related to that device and network.</p>

<p>Other parties that support us by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or to track aggregate usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use our services or other parties’ services. Those parties may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. Fox News does not control these parties’ technologies. Their use is governed by the privacy policies of the parties using such technologies.
