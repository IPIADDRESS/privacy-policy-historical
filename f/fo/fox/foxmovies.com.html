	<h4 id="sec1">1. INTRODUCTION</h4>

	<a href="#top">Top</a>

	<p>Fox Filmed Entertainment, Inc. ("Fox FE" or "we") operates FoxMovies.com, FoxSearchlight.com, and other entertainment websites featuring content related to Fox Filmed Entertainment movies (the "Sites").  The services Fox FE offers include the Sites and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by Fox FE in connection with the Sites, including when they are accessed via the Internet, mobile or other device (collectively, the "Fox FE Services").  Fox FE is part of the United States based operations of News Corporation.</p>

	<p>Some of our online activities are directed to children under 13 and in those instances, we provide additional privacy protections.  To read about these additional protections please see Section 8 below.</p>

	<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users.  This Privacy Policy describes the collection and use of users' personal information on the Fox FE Services. It also describes generally Fox FEâ€˜s practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account.</p>

	<!-- Section 2 -->

	<h4 id="sec2">2. SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON FOX FE SERVICES</h4>

	<a href="#top">Top</a>

	<p><i>User Submitted Information</i></p>

	<p><b>Registration Information</b> is the information that users must provide to Fox FE at registration for or upon subscription to a Fox FE Service, for example, to create an account, enter a contest, promotion or sweepstake, receive a newsletter, play a game or take a survey.</p>

	<p><b>Public Information and Posts</b> consist of your your posts and comments on the Fox FE Services, for example, in comments, forums or blogs.  Your Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results both on the  Fox FE Services and on external search engines.</p>

	<p><i>Fox FE Collected Information</i></p>

	<p><b>Fox FE Site Activity Information.</b> When users access the Fox FE Services, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits.  For example, in order to permit your connection to the Fox FE Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.  If you access the Fox FE Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.  We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier.  Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so Fox FE can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. We may use these technologies to collect and store information about your usage of Fox FE Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen. Fox FE may also use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of the Fox FE Services to personal information obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you have asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on the Sites may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences.</p>

	<p>Third parties that support the Fox FE Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing users to share content and post comments or tracking aggregate site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.  Fox FE does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.  For more information about third-party ad networks that use these technologies, see <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info</a>. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.  Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies" target="_blank">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies</a>).  Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, including cookies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website, see <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html</a>.  Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through the Fox FE Services.</p>

	<p><b>Third Parties.</b>  To improve the quality of the Fox FE Services, we may supplement the information we collect with information from third parties.  If you access the Fox FE Services through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through your Facebook account, we may also collect your user ID and/or user name associated with that third-party service, or any information you have made public in connection with that service or which the third party shares with partner services.</p>

	<!-- Section 3 -->

	<h4 id="sec3">3. NOTICE &amp; CHOICE</h4>

	<a href="#top">Top</a>

	<p><b>Means of Notice.</b>  This Privacy Policy is the primary means by which Fox FE provides you with notice about its collection and use of your information.</p>

	<p><b>Privacy Policy Changes.</b>  Fox FE may modify this Privacy Policy as necessary.  If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that expand our rights to use your personal information, we will notify you to seek your consent through email or a prominent posting on the Fox FE Services.</p>

	<p><b>Location of Data.</b>  The Fox FE Services are hosted in the United States.  If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information you provide transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States and other countries where data protection and other privacy laws may not offer the same level of protection as in your jurisdiction, such as the European Union.  This includes the use of cookies and other tracking technologies as described above.  As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.</p>

	<p><b>Linked Services.</b>  The Fox FE Services may also be linked to sites or services operated by Fox FE affiliates (i.e., that are part of the News America Group: "Affiliated Companies") or third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, stores, contests or sweepstakes, ticket sales, or applications developed and maintained by third parties. Fox FE is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you submit information directly to a third party, leave the Fox FE Services via a link, enable a third-party service, or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of that third-party. Additionally, although all Affiliated Companies adhere to the News Corporation corporate Privacy Principles, users who visit an Affiliated Company site should still refer to its separate privacy policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.</p>

We do not share your non-public personal information with these third parties, but we may share anonymized or aggregated information with them to improve the relevancy of the ads you see on the Fox FE Services. As noted above, these third-party advertising networks and advertisers may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect and track non-personally identifiable information such as demographic information, aggregated information, and Internet activity to assist them in delivering advertising that is more relevant to your interests.  To find out more about third-party online advertising and to opt out of this type of advertising, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.

	<!-- Section 8 -->

	<h4 id="sec8">8. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h4>

	<a href="#top">Top</a>

	<p>We at Fox FE understand that the Internet presents an opportunity for us to reach the public in new and exciting ways with information about our programming, fun games, exciting sweepstakes and contests, email, chat rooms, bulletin boards and other forms of interactivity.  Fox FE also recognizes the privacy concerns of parents (including other legal guardians), and the importance of protecting the privacy of the information collected from children at the Fox FE Services.  Parents of children under 13 who visit the Fox FE Services can be confident that any personal information that may be provided to the Fox FE Services will be collected and maintained in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").  Fox FE encourages children to check with their parents before using the Fox FE Services and encourages parents to supervise their children's activities online and to participate with their children's online activities whenever possible.  </p>

	<p><b>Collection and Use of Personal Information from Children Under 13.</b></p>

	<p>When a visitor to the Fox FE Services is under the age of 13, Fox FE does not require the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary for him or her to participate in an activity as a condition of such participation.</p>

	<p>Fox FE may collect and use different types of personal information submitted to the Fox FE Services by children under 13 in a variety of ways, which are described below.  In each instance, we comply with the parental consent requirements of COPPA.</p>

	 <p>(i)    We may collect a child's email address in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or game for the sole purpose of communicating with the child on a one-time-only basis (i.e., to contact a sweepstakes winner).  This information will not be used to re-contact the child, and will be deleted from our records when the contest or game is over.  Parental consent is obtained before we send a prize to any winner under 13.</p>

	<p>(ii)    We may collect a child's email address in order to respond more than once to a child's specific request.  For example, the child may want to subscribe to an online newsletter or receive other online communications from Fox FE.  In these instances Fox FE will also obtain a parent's email address along with the child's.  Before any further contact with the child, Fox FE will send an email to the parent (A) notifying him or her we have collected the child's email address in order to respond more than once to the child's request for a subscription, information, etc.; (B) informing the parent that he or she can refuse us permission to contact the child, and how to do so; and (C) informing the parent that if he or she does not respond to the email within one (1) week, Fox FE may use the child's information for the purpose for which it was submitted.  Under no circumstances will the child be allowed to participate without giving a parent's email address.</p>

	<p>(iii)    We may collect a child's personal information (including name, email address, mailing address and phone number) for such activities as chats, forums, surveys, games, bulletin boards, requests for suggestions, subscription registrations, content submissions, requests for products or services, or requests for additional information.  In these instances we will initially collect only the child's name and online contact information and the email address of the child's parent.  Before using this information for any purpose, we will send the parent an email that (A) informs the parent that we wish to collect and use the child's personal information and need the parent's consent to do so, and (B) provides the parent with a link to access this Privacy Policy, which describes our information collection and use policies as required by COPPA.  Fox FE will ask the parent to provide consent by return email.  Upon receipt of the email consent, we will send the parent a confirming email.</p>

	<p>(iv) We may collect a child's name and email to protect the safety of a child who is participating in the Fox FE Services. In these instances, we will notify the parent and give the parent an opportunity to prevent further use of this information.</p>

	<p>(v) We may collect a child's name and email address to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security of this Fox FE Services, to protect against liability, to respond to law enforcement or as required or permitted by law and disclose such information to third parties where it is necessary for such purpose.  Information collected for these reasons will not be used for any other purpose.</p>

	<p>(vi)    We may share your child's personal information with service providers that provide support for the FOX FE Services by, for example, providing, or assisting us in providing, the FOX FE Services to your child.  If we plan to share your child's personal information with a third party for any reason other than to provide these or other internal support services, we will notify you and give you the opportunity to opt-out of such disclosure.  Parents may consent to Fox FE's collection and use of a child's personal information without consenting to the disclosure of the information to third parties other than such service providers.</p>

	<p>(vii)  If Fox FE sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, Fox FE may transfer your child's information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.</p>

	<p><b>Linked Services.</b></p>

	<p>The Fox FE Services may also be linked to sites or services operated by Affiliated Companies or third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, stores, contests or sweepstakes, ticket sales, or applications developed and maintained by third parties.  Those sites or services, which are not controlled by Fox FE, may collect personal information from your child.  Parents should therefore check the relevant site's privacy policy to understand how it collects and uses children's personal information.  Fox FE is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties.  Additionally, although all Affiliated Companies adhere to the News Corporation corporate Privacy Principles, parents should still refer to the Affiliated Company's site or service's separate privacy policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.  Fox FE will not knowingly receive any personal information from another site from a child under the age of 13 if that site does not follow the requirements of COPPA.</p>

	<p><b>Reviewing and Making Changes to Personal Information Collected from Children Under 13.</b></p>

	<p>Parents of children under age 13 may review or delete personal information about their children from our records at any time.  If you would like your child's personal information deleted, please contact us at feedbackus@fox.com.  We will delete your child's information from our database if you so request.</p>

	<p>If you would like to review the personal information in our records submitted by your child, or change any personal information previously submitted by your child, please go to Member Center and follow the instructions.</p>

	<p>Use and participation in Fox's Internet site is contingent upon Participant's acceptance of the following terms and rules. By using this web site, Participant accepts these terms. For purposes of this agreement, "Participant" refers to you. "Fox" refers to Twentieth Century Fox, its parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies.</p>

	<p>1. <u>RULES OF CONDUCT:</u></p>

	<p>(a) Participant shall not post or transmit through Fox any defamatory, threatening, obscene, harmful, pornographic or other material which would violate or infringe in any way upon the rights of others, or which would give rise to criminal or civil liability and/or violate federal or local law or regulation.</p>

Fox is not responsible for any materials provided by users which are deemed harmful or offensive to others. Fox is not responsible in any way for any injury, loss or damage which occurs as a result of an opinion expressed or information provided in these sections of the site.</p>

	<p>(b) Fox makes no warranties, express or implied, as to the content in the Fox site or the accuracy or reliability of any information or statements contained therein.

	<p>5. <u>TERMINATION:</u></p>

	<p>Fox shall have the right to immediately terminate any Participant's use of the Fox site if Fox determines in its sole discretion that Participant has violated the Rules of Conduct set forth herein or otherwise breached this agreement, or has engaged in conduct which Fox determines in its sole discretion to be unacceptable.</p>
