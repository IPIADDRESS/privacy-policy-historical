                you to complete a transaction or to provide a better service, for instance, to process
                an order, to correspond or in connection with a job application.
            </p>
            <h3>
                USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

                Your right to privacy and data security is a primary concern of Foxconn. The ultimate
                purpose in using your information is to support and enhance our relationship with
                you, for instance, to process your purchase, provide service and support, and share
                product, service and company news with you. Foxconn will in no event sell your personal
                information. Foxconn only share your personal data outside the companies of Foxconn

                Foxconn fulfill its obligations to you and who share the commitment hereof to protecting
                your privacy. Foxconn will safeguard and protect against unauthorized access, use
                and disclosure of your information by using appropriate measures and processes to
                maintain security.</p>
