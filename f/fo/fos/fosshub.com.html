<p>Dear visitor, please read our Privacy Policy</p>
<p>To help you make decisions about the information you provide anywhere on this site, this notice has been provided to outline our practices. You should know that we respect your privacy, and we will never sell your information to anyone. Also, we hate spam as much as you do, so you will only ever get email from us that you have asked for and we have personally approved for distribution to the list.</p>

<p>We use secure hosting accounts and other security measures to protect our database and any information provided.</p>

<p>Any e-mail you receive from this site will be sent as an answer to a question of yours made via contact form or an old contact. We do not keep an email database.</p>

<p><strong>Tracking</strong></p>

<p>We don’t directly track your presence on this website. Your IP address is logged and we look at the server logs on occasion, but this is in an aggregate fashion for the purpose of determining why people come to visit us. What we are most interested in specifically are two things: The websites that link to us and send traffic here, and what keywords people use to find us via search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and MSN.</p>

<p>Depending on your location we can place a cookie that has a single purpose - to show us your location so that we can serve you the download from the closest server. The cookie is set to expire automatically after 48 hours and has no other hidden purpose (except for the download service) so we can claim that we use a single cookie without tracking or collecting data. We also run a number of scripts from providers such as Google. Some of these set web browser cookies. Google in particular quietly collects a tremendous amount of data on your browsing habits, and we participate in that data collection.</p>
