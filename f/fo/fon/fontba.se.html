Automatic collection: whenever You access or use the Services, we may use technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Services are accessed and used. Vulnerable collection: includes the information, You provide us upon Your own will to do so. Herewith You can see what we do collect when You use:</p></div><h2><strong>1. The app</strong></h2><div id="app-automatic" class="block"><h2>(a) Automatic Collection.

When this moment occurs and You are purchasing Awesome, we need the information about You for billing purposes. That is the moment when we are collecting the information about You. Our form contains the minimum information required for successful processing of a credit card transaction and register the user to receive technical support: <strong>Billing address</strong>, <strong>Full Name</strong>, <strong>Country</strong>, <strong>Email</strong>, <strong>Credit Card details</strong>. Nothing more than this. All information including credit card numbers are always collected via a secure server to prevent unauthorized access during transmission of the data.
