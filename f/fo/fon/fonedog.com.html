            <ul>
                <li>We use service providers who assist us in meeting business operations needs, including hosting, delivering, and improving our Products. We also use service providers for specific services and functions, including email communication, customer support services, and analytics. These service providers may only access, process, or store Personal Data pursuant to our instructions and to perform their duties to us.</li>
                <li>We have your explicit consent to share your Personal Data (if required).</li>
                <li>We believe it is necessary to investigate potential violations of the Terms of Products, to enforce these Terms of Products, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or potential threats against persons, property, or the systems on which we operate our Site and/or Products.</li>
                <li>We determine that the access, preservation, or disclosure of your Personal Data is required by law to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of FoneDog and users of our Site and/or Products, or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including national security or law enforcement requests.</li>
                <li>We need to do so in connection with a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization, a sale of some or all of our assets or stock, a public offering of securities, or steps in consideration of such activities (e.g., due diligence). In these cases, some or all of your Personal Data may be shared with or transferred to another entity, subject to this Privacy Policy.</li>
                <li>We may disclose Non-Personal Data publicly and to third parties – for example, in public reports about word usage, to partners under an agreement with us, or as part of progress reports we may provide to users.</li>

Those applications will provide you with notice and request your consent in order to obtain such access or information. Please consider your selection of such applications and services, and your permissions, carefully.</p>
            <p>Some third parties' embedded content or plugins on our Sites and/or Products, such as Facebook "Like" buttons, may allow their operators to learn that you have visited the Sites, and they may combine this knowledge with other data they have collected about your visits to other websites or online services that can identify you.</p>

            <p class="title">Data Storage, Transfer, Retention, And Deletion</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Data storage and transfer</p>
            <p>When you use the Products on your computing device, user content you save will be stored locally on that device and synced with our servers. If you post or transfer any information to or through our Site and/or Products, you are agreeing to such information being hosted and accessed on our servers.</p>
            <p>The collected personal data may be transferred by FoneDog to recipients which are located outside the European Union and such destinations may not have laws which protect a user's personal data to the same extent as in the European Union.</p>
            <p>FoneDog ensures that your personal data processed by FoneDog or by its suppliers and partners operating outside the European Union are treated securely and are protected against unauthorized access, loss or destruction, unlawful processing and any processing which is inconsistent with the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Data deletion and retention</p>
            <p>You can remove your information from FoneDog at any time by emailing us with the respective request: support@fonedog.com. However, we may keep some of your information for as long as reasonably necessary for our legitimate business interests, including fraud detection and prevention and to comply with our legal obligations including tax, legal reporting, and auditing obligations.</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Data breaches</p>
            <p>All breaches will be reported to the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours, unless the data was anonymized or encrypted or if it has a particularly high risk. Breaches of this policy by staff, contractors, officers of FoneDog will be dealt with under the company's grievance and disciplinary policy and may lead to a disciplinary sanction.</p>
            <p>If FoneDog learns of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address that you have provided to us or by posting a notice on the Site. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing.</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Your Rights</p>
            <p>FoneDog uses, processes, and stores information, as necessary to perform our contract with you, and based on our legitimate interests in order to provide the Products and Services. We rely on your consent to process information to send promotional emails and to place cookies on your devices. In some cases, FoneDog may process Personal Data pursuant to the legal obligation or to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>
            <p>Individuals located in the European Economic Area (EEA) have certain rights in respect to their personal information, including the right to access, correct, or delete information we process through your use of the Sites, and/or Products. If you're a user based in the EEA, you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have your information corrected or deleted. You may ask us to correct information you think is inaccurate or completely delete all information that we hold about you by emailing:support@fonedog.com.</li>
                <li>Access your personal data report by submitting a request at support@fonedog.com. This report will include the information we have about you, provided to you in a structured, commonly used, and portable format.</li>
                <li>Object to us processing your personal data. It is your right to lodge an objection to the processing of your personal data by emailing: support@fonedog.com if you feel the "ground relating to your particular situation" apply. The only reasons we will be able to deny your request is if we can show compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, which override your interest, rights, and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim.</li>
                <li>You can ask us to stop using your information, including when we use your personal data to send you marketing emails. We only send marketing communications to users located in the EEA with your prior consent, and you may withdraw your consent at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link found within FoneDog emails and changing your contact preferences. Please note you will continue to receive transactional messages related to our Products, even if you unsubscribe from marketing emails.</li>
                <li>Complain to a regulator. If you're based in the EEA and think that we haven't complied with data protection laws, you have a right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.</li>
