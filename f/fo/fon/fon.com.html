<h1><a name="000111"></a>Privacy and Data Protection Policy</h1>
		
<p>We are FON, a Community of people who share WiFi. As such, it is essential that our users feel safe and secure both in the comfort of their homes/offices and throughout our Community. This Privacy and Data Policy (hereinafter, “Policy”) is a beta version. We hope that you will help us continuously improve on this version to ensure that our Policy meets all of our Community’s needs and expectations.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we hope that this Policy is flexible, clear, and easy to understand. We have tried to use plain language wherever possible. FON has its central headquarters in Alcobendas (Madrid), Spain, and European and Spanish legislation on privacy and data protection are very strict. As a result, FON is obliged, under Spanish Data Protection Laws, to include in this Policy certain legalistic terms. Please do not let this detract you. It is for your protection.</p>

<p>Fon Technology, S.L (hereinafter, “FON”), fully complies with the current legislation regarding the protection of data of a personal nature, and with the confidentiality commitments characteristic of the activity that it undertakes. Furthermore, FON complies with the Spanish Organic Act 15/1999 (December 13, 1999) entitled the Law of Personal Data Protection (Ley de Protección de Datos de Carácter Personal) (hereinafter, “LOPD”), its complementary regulation and other relevant legislation.</p>

<p>All of your personal data that FON receives and stores shall be kept in a file called “Clients File.” We have notified the Spanish Agency of Data Protection of this with the inscription number 2053430001. Fon Technology, S.L., a Spanish company, domiciled at Avenida de Bruselas, nº 7, Alcobendas (Madrid), Spain and registered in the Commercial Registry of Madrid (Tomo 22.050, Folio 41, Sección 8, Hoja M-393201) and with the tax ID number B84504554 is solely responsible for this file. The data filed is adequate, appropriate and does not exceed the scope, purpose, and goals of the services that FON provides.</p>

<p>The purpose of this file is for FON to better serve its users as well as to maintain contact with them. FON may also use the data to send commercial information as well as for any other purpose FON deems to be in the interest of its users. <br>
The treatment of personal data and its use for commercial communications purposes complies with the applicable legislation.</p>

<p>FON has adopted the technical measures necessary to maintain the security level required, according to the nature of the personal data processed and the circumstances of this processing, with the objective of avoiding (in the realm of the possible and always using the latest in technology) its alteration, loss, processing or non-authorized access.</p>

<p>Access (and information about the access) through each Hotspot is governed by the laws of the country where it is located. You should recognize that joining the FON Community gives you access to Hotspots around the globe.  Access points in different countries may be subject to differing local laws, and we may be required to store data to comply with those laws. The Privacy and Data Protection Policies and the Terms &amp; Conditions applicable to the Hotspot through which you are connecting will always be available through the login screen or at www.fon.com.</p>

<p>Please recognize that this Policy only applies to how FON deals with your privacy and your personal information. It does not apply to any other company or to any other company's websites even if you access them through FON’s Community or once you have left the FON Community. If you disclose your personal information to other companies your information will be dealt with according to their privacy practices.</p>

<h2>FON Respects your Privacy</h2>

<p>We do not collect information about the contents of your communications. Because FON cannot guarantee that others will not attempt to access those communications, you may wish to use encryption or Virtual Private Network software to secure your communications further. </p>

<p>You accept and agree that FON needs to share the address of your access point to enable other Foneros to find it!  We will allow you to edit the location information to make it less specific – for example, removing the apartment or suite number from an address, or giving a street number range (8 – 14 Main Street) rather than a precise number, and fuzz the geolocation data. These fuzzed addresses will be visible in forms such as FON maps and directories of nearby access points. We will not publicly associate your name with your address and access point, and we will not make your name or more specific address available to third parties. We may allow third parties to access the list of fuzzed addresses for such purposes as creating hotspot maps. We cannot guarantee that third parties will not be able to deduce your precise address from these addresses. </p>

<p>We will not sell or share your personal data to third parties without your explicit consent. You agree and accept that the data you provide to FON can be shared between companies of FON´s Group within the scope of this Policy. </p>

<p>In the future, FON may offer additional services (e.g., by signing your name to a Fonero’s Blog or guestbook). For those additional services, other privacy policies may apply. If this be the case, we will ask you to review them carefully.</p>

<p>You are permitted to exercise your rights to access, amend, delete and contest the data you have provided. Should you wish to notify us in this respect, send us your written request to FON TECHNOLOGY, S.L., Avenida de Bruselas, nº 7, Alcobendas (Madrid), or by email to: privacy@fon.com. Do not forget to clearly state the right you wish to exercise.</p>

<p>This policy is subject to change based upon modification to the current applicable law.  If the policy changes, you will be notified on your next login and will have the opportunity to cancel our service if you are not satisfied with these changes.  </p>

<p>FON’s goal is to respect your privacy to the best of its ability. Please contact us at privacy@fon.com with suggestions for improving this Policy.<br>
