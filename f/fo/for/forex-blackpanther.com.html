                <strong>3. Information We Collect and How We Use It</strong><br>

                information from and about its users in three ways - directly from our Web 
                Server logs, the user, and with Cookies.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>a. Web Server Logs</strong><br>
                When you visit our Website, we may track information to administer the site and 
                analyze its usage.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Examples of information we may track include:</strong><br>
                <br>
                Your Internet protocol address.<br>
                The kind of browser or computer you use.<br>
                Number of links you click within the site.<br>
                State or country from which you accessed the site.<br>
                Date and time of your visit.<br>
                Name of your Internet service provider.<br>
                Web page you linked to our site from.<br>
                Pages you viewed on the site.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>b. Use of Cookies</strong><br>
                The owners and publishers of http://www.Forex-Blackpanther.com may use cookies to 
                personalize or enhance your user experience. A cookie is a small text file that 
                is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run 
                programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to 
                you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain that issued the cookie 
                to you.<br>
                <br>
                One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to 
                save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a 
                site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent 
                visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and 
                eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login 
                information as well as providing personalized functionality.<br>
                <br>
                The owners and publishers of http://www.Forex-Blackpanther.com reserve the right to 
                share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but does not allow 
                other companies to place cookies on our website unless there is a temporary, 
                overriding customer value (such as merging into http://www.Forex-Blackpanther.com a 
                site that relies on third-party cookies).<br>
                <br>
                You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers 
                automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to 
                decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be 
                aware that this may disable some of the functionality on our Website.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>c. Personal Information Users</strong><br>
                Visitors to our website can register to purchase services. When you register, we 
                will request some personal information such as name, address, e-mail, telephone 
                number or facsimile number, account number and other relevant information. If 
                you are purchasing a service, we will request financial information. Any 
                financial information we collect is used only to bill you for the services you 
                purchased. If you purchase by credit card, this information may be forwarded to 
                your credit card provider. For other types of registrations, we will ask for the 
                relevant information. You may also be asked to disclose personal information to 
                us so that we can provide assistance and information to you. For example, such 
                data may be warranted in order to provide online technical support and 
                troubleshooting.<br>
                <br>
                We will not disclose personally identifiable information we collect from you to 
                third parties without your permission except to the extent necessary, including:<br>
                <br>
                To fulfill your service requests for services.<br>
                To protect ourselves from liability,<br>
                To respond to legal process or comply with law, or<br>
                In connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of the company.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>4. Use of Web Beacons or GIF files</strong><br>
                http://www.Forex-Blackpanther.com’s web pages may contain electronic images known 
                as Web beacons – sometimes also called single-pixel gifs – that allow the owners 
                and publishers of http://www.Forex-Blackpanther.com to count users who have visited 
                those pages and to deliver co-branded services. The owners and publishers of 
                http://www.Forex-Blackpanther.com may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail 
                messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened 
                and acted upon.<br>
                <br>
                Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help 
                determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or e-mail 
                communications. These Web beacons may be used by these service providers to 
                place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider to 
                recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or e-mails and 
                compiles anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn 
                enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and e-mails 
                bring you to our website and how you use the site. The owners and publishers of 
                http://www.Forex-Blackpanther.com.com prohibit Web beacons from being used to collect 
                or access your personal information.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>5. Accessing Web Account Information</strong><br>
                We will provide you with the means to ensure that personally identifiable 
                information in your web account file is correct and current. You may review this 
                information by contacting our support attendants via our support desk:

                to occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise
