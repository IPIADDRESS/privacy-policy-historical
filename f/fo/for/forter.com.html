Our fraud solution provides merchants (“</span><b>Merchants</b><span>”), who use our expertise and proprietary technology in order to get real-time and automated decisions for every transaction made by Merchants’ customers (“</span><b>Customers</b><span>”).</span></p>
                                <p><span>When a Customer lands on any of the Merchant’s websites or applications (“</span><b>Merchant
                                        Platforms</b><span>), and subject to a full Merchant consent, we process relevant information pertaining to the Customer usage of the merchant websites or application (“Merchant Platforms”) and compare it to known fraudulent behavioral trends in order to protect the Merchant from fraudulent activity (collectively: “</span><b>the

                                <p><span>Our Services not only help Merchants, but also provide much safer and better online shopping experience for Customers, as they help prevent a customer account takeover by a fraudster, allow Customers to get rid of the delays in order confirmation, and minimize potential mistaken rejection of transactions, which can make shopping online very frustrating.</span>

We encourage Customers to read the Privacy Policy carefully and use it to make informed decisions. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to each Merchant’s privacy practices and any processing of information, which may be made by the Merchant outside the scope of our Services. If Customers wish to understand how the Merchant may use such information, they should review the applicable Merchant’s privacy policy.</span>

                                <p><span>We process two types of information which relate to Customers.</span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>The first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a Customer, which may be available or collected via Customers’ use of the Merchant Platform (“</span><b>Non-personal
                                        Information</b><span>”). We are not aware of the identity of the Customer from which the Non-personal Information was collected. Non-personal Information which is being collected may include Customer’s aggregated usage information, device fingerprinting, browsing events and technical information transmitted by Customers’ device, including certain software and hardware information (e.g. the type of browser and operating system the Customer’s device uses, language preference, access time and the domain name of the website from which the Customer is linked to the Merchant Platform; etc.) as well as information regarding Customer’s activity on the Merchant Platform (e.g. pages viewed, clicks, actions, etc.).</span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>The second type of information, mostly the data in the checkout page, is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (“</span><b>Personal
                                        Information</b><span>”). The Personal Information we process through our Services includes information which is submitted to Merchant Platforms directly by the Customer, such as phone number; full name; address; e-mail address and other information that we may need in order to provide our Services. With regards to Customer’s payment means, we are not collecting full credit card details, but only the credit card BIN and the last four digits of the credit number, alongside the cardholder name and expiration date.</span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>We may also process Personal Information from Customer’s device, such as geolocation data, IP address and other unique identifiers.</span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>If we combine Personal Information with Non-personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.</span>

                                <h2><b>How we collect information</b></h2>
                                <p><span>We use three main methods to collect information, which relates to Customers:</span>
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><span> With full Merchant consent, we collect information through Customers’ use of any of the Merchant Platforms. In other words, when the Customer is using the Merchant Platform we may gather information relating to such usage.</span>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><span> We collect information, which the Customer voluntarily provides to the Merchant or shares on the Merchant Platforms and which is provided to us by the Merchant. For example, we use Personal Information that the Customer discloses on the Merchant Platforms (e.g. delivery address, partial credit card number, etc.), when the Customer wishes to conduct an online transaction.</span>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p><span>iii. We collect information which is available via public websites, social networks, etc. and from our trusted service providers and is relevant to our Services. For example, we may collect information such as phone type (e.g. mobile, landline, etc.), age and gender from different resources across the web and perform social network analysis in order to support our analysis of a transaction and the assessment of whether or not a transaction is suspected as fraudulent.</span>
                                </p>
                                <h3><b>Cookies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

                                <p><span>We use cookies and other technologies when Customers access the Merchant’s website.</span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>A “cookie” is a small piece of information that the Merchant’s website assigns to the Customer’s browser while the Customer is browsing such website. Cookies are very helpful and are used by us for the purpose of gathering relevant information in order to detect possible online and identity frauds.</span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>We use ‘session cookies’, which are stored temporarily during a browsing session and are deleted from Customer’s device when the browser is closed, and ‘persistent cookies’, which are saved on Customer’s device for a fixed period and are not deleted when the browser is closed.</span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>The Customer may disable the storage of and/or remove the cookies via his browser settings.</span>
                                </p>
                                <h3><b>How we use the information</b></h3>
                                <p><span>We use Customers’ Personal Information in the manners described in this Privacy Policy. In addition to the purposes listed above, the information we collect is being used for any of the following purposes:</span>

                                </p>
                                <p><span>We may also disclose Personal Information, or any information submitted via the Services if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; (ii) enforce our policies, including investigations of potential violations thereof; (iii) investigate, detect, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or other wrongdoing, suspected fraud or security issues; (iv) to establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; (v) prevent harm to the rights, property or safety of us, the Merchants, the Customers or any third party; or (vi) for the purpose of collaborating with law enforcement agencies and/or in case we find it necessary in order to enforce intellectual property or other legal rights.</span>

                                <p><span>We value Customers’ privacy and control over their Personal Information.

                                    </li>
                                    <li><span>We will request documentation (which may include Personal Information) verifying the identification of the requesting Customer.

                                    </li>
                                    <li><span>After we will confirm the identity and the legal right of the requesting Customer to retrieve Personal Information, we will query our database and respond to the Customer’s request.
