  <h2>FORA.tv Privacy Policy</h2>
</div>
<div class="left_column">
<p><strong>Effective <em>March 17, 2010</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>FORA.tv  Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>FORA.tv  provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures  regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information received from users  of FORA.tv (this "<strong>Site</strong>").  This Privacy Policy applies only to this Site. This Privacy Policy may be  updated from time to time. </p>
<p>We  will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on  the Site. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes.  Unless otherwise defined herein, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the  meanings provided in the Terms of Use.<br>
  <br>
  By  using our Site you are consenting to our processing of your information as set  forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "<strong>Processing</strong>" means using cookies on  a computer or using or touching information in any way, including, but not  limited to collecting, storing and deleting, using, combining and disclosing  information and transferring it to the United States and internationally. </p>
<p><strong>Information  Collection and Use</strong></p>
<p>Our  Primary goals in collecting information are: to provide and improve services,  features and content (together, the "<strong>Service</strong>"),  to allow users to personalize their use of the Service, and to enable users to  easily navigate and enjoy the Site. </p>
<p>When  you register with us through the Site, as a FORA.tv Subscriber, when you choose  to create your own profile webpage or set up an account to access premium content  and services we will ask you for personally identifiable information which is  information about you that when on its own or in combination with other  variables can be used to contact or identify you (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”). Personal Information includes, but is not  limited to, your name, email address, postal address, credit card information  and an account password. We use your Personal Information to provide the  Service and administer your inquiries. </p>
<p>We  also collect the non-personally identifiable information that you provide as  part of registration and the administration and personalization of your profile  webpage (e.g., without limitation zip code and individual preferences) (“<strong>Aggregate Demographic Information</strong>”).  Certain pieces of your information (for example, your zip code) are considered  a part of your Personal Information when they are combined with other  information (for example, your street address) in a way that enables you to be  identified but the same pieces of information are considered part of your  Aggregate Demographic Information when taken alone or combined with  non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may  combine your Personal Information with this Aggregate Demographic Information  and with aggregate information collected from other FORA.tv Users to attempt to  provide you with a better experience and improve the quality and value of the  Service. </p>
<p>We  also use your Personal Information to contact you with FORA.tv newsletters,  promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. Subscribers  who agree to the terms and conditions of the FORA.tv Terms of Service Agreement  are given the opportunity to opt-in to the receipt of such communications from  us in the future. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive  such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions  provided in any of the communications or update your “user preferences”  information. (See “<strong>Changing or Deleting  Information</strong>,” below.) </p>
<p><u>Log  Data</u>.  When you visit the Site, whether as a FORA.tv Subscriber or a non-registered  user just browsing (any of these, a "<strong>FORA.tv  User</strong>"), our servers automatically record information that your browser  sends whenever you visit a website ("<strong>Log  Data</strong>"). This log data may include information such as your IP address,  browser type or the domain from which you are visiting. For most users  accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider (or "<strong>ISP</strong>"), the IP address will be  different every time you log on. Except in the instances described herein, we  do not use this information to identify you personally. We use it to monitor  use of the Site and the Service and for the Site’s technical administration. </p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
  Like  many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a  small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for  record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize  persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future  logins to the Site. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain  features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site, and  to monitor aggregate usage by FORA.tv Users and web traffic routing on the  Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer  when you disconnect from the Site and Service. Third party advertisers on the  Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your  browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you  before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept  cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all  functionality of the Service. </p>
<p><strong>Information Sharing  and Disclosure </strong></p>
<p><u>FORA.tv  Subscribers</u>.  When you register through the Site and submit your Personal Information to  create a profile webpage, FORA.tv Users will see your "Screen Name"  and the month and year you first registered with FORA.tv ("<strong>Required Subscriber Identifiers</strong>").  You can choose what other Personal Information you provide as part of your  profile ("<strong>Other Subscriber  Information</strong>"), and in some cases you can choose whether to share that  information publicly on the Site by making selections via the "user  preferences" section of your profile webpage. Providing Other Subscriber  Information is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction  you want to have with FORA.tv Users. We recommend that you guard your anonymity  and sensitive information. </p>
<p><u>Aggregate  Information</u>.  We may share Aggregate Demographic Information and Log Data with third parties  for industry analysis and demographic profiling. This information will not  contain your Personal Information. </p>
<p><u>Service  Providers</u>.  We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service,  to provide the Service on our behalf or to perform Site-related services (e.g.,  without limitation, bill and credit card payment processing, maintenance  services, database management and improvement of the Site’s features). These  third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these  tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other  purpose. </p>
<p><u>PayPal</u>.&nbsp; When you purchase a subscription or pay an  access fee via PayPal, PayPal will collect and store any information that you  submit during the PayPal service process.&nbsp;  Refer to PayPal’s Privacy Policy located at http://www.paypal.com for  more information about PayPal’s privacy practices.&nbsp; In connection with the PayPal payment process,  PayPal may transfer us your PayPal user ID, your PayPal email address (if  different from the PayPal user ID), your postal address, the amount of your  payment, method of PayPal payment and your phone number. </p>
<p><u>Compliance  with Laws and Law Enforcement</u>. FORA.tv cooperates with government and law  enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We  will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement  officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary  or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including subpoenas), to  protect the property and rights of FORA.tv or a third party, to protect the  safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal,  unethical or legally actionable activity. </p>
<p><u>Business  Transfers</u>.  FORA.tv may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets,  including information provided by you, in connection with a merger,  reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. If the new  entity wishes to make additional uses of your information different from those  described in this Privacy Policy you will have the opportunity to decline such  use at that time. </p>
<p><strong>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong> <br>
  <br>
  California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of FORA.tv who are California residents to  request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to  third parties for their direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; If you  are a California  resident and have provided FORA.tv with personal information within the last  year, you may make such a request by emailing us at the following  address [INSERT EMAIL]. </p>
<p>Within  30 days of receiving such a request, we will provide a list of the categories  of personal information disclosed to third parties for such third parties’  direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along  with the names and addresses of these third parties. A request may be made no  more than once per calendar year and we are not  required to respond to requests made by means other than through the e-mail  address above.</p>
<p><strong>Changing or Deleting  Your Information </strong><br>
  All  Subscribers may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in  their registration profile by contacting us. If you completely delete any such  information, then your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to  delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to  accommodate your request. See below for privacy contact information. </p>
<p><strong>Security &amp;  International Transfer </strong><br>
FORA.tv  is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ administrative,  physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from  unauthorized access. Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on  — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other  governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as  those in your jurisdiction. FORA.tv transfers Personal Information to the United States  and processes it there. </p>
<p>We  will disclose any compromise of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of  your unencrypted electronically stored Personal Data (as defined in applicable  state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous  posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without  unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement  or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore  the reasonable integrity of the data system. </p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Sites </strong><br>
  Our  Site contains links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by  “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, you will be directed  to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a  banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization  or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise  control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own  cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal  information from you. This Privacy Policy addresses the use and disclosure of  information that we collect from you through this Site. Other sites follow  different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you  submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of  the other websites you visit. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Our Policy Toward  Children </strong><br>
  This  Site is not directed to children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes  aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without  their consent, he or she should contact us at Privacy@fora.tv. If we become  aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will  delete such information from our files. </p>
<p><strong>Contacting Us </strong><br>
  If  you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at  Privacy@fora.tv or at: FORA.tv Privacy Policy, 1550 Bryant St, Ste 700, San    Francisco, CA 94103 </p>
