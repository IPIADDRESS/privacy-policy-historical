              <p><em>"You" and / or "Your" and / or "User" shall include and mean the person who is accessing the aforesaid websites through any means available now and / or maybe available in the future.</em></p>

              <p><em>Governing Law and Meanings: -</em></p>

              <p><em>These Terms of Use are being governed by the Laws of India and meaning of words used herein in connection with the use of the said website shall bear the meaning as may be envisaged and interpreted by the Information Technology Act, 2000 and any of its Amendment Acts.</em></p>

              <p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?</strong></p>

              <p>The information gathered when you interact with <strong>BMPL</strong> falls into two categories: 1) Personal information, which includes personal information you supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for one of our sites, enter a contest or provide your email address and 2) Non-personal information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected by us as well as third parties.</p>

              <p><strong><em>Personal Information That You Give Us or Ask a Third Party to Share with Us</em></strong></p>

              <p><strong>Registration Information</strong></p>

              <p>Registration for <strong>BMPL</strong> may require that you supply certain personal information, including a unique email address and demographic information (ZIP code, age, sex, household income, job industry and job title) to register.</p>

              <p>You may register or enhance your profile by linking your Facebook or Google accounts on <strong>BMPL</strong>. By doing this, you are asking them to send us certain information from those social media accounts, and you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use what they send us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Social media registration features may collect your IP address, the page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website.</p>

              <p>You can disassociate your <strong>BMPL</strong> registration from third-party accounts any time.</p>

              <p>Kindly note that <strong>BMPL</strong> shall not responsible for any information collected by the third party from you.</p>

              <p><strong>User Generated Content and Public Activities (Including Comments and Reader Reviews)</strong></p>

              <p>We offer you opportunities to engage in public activities on <strong>BMPL</strong>.com and other <strong>BMPL</strong> Services. "Public activities" are any actions you take on <strong>BMPL</strong> that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments, recommendations, reader reviews, ratings or any other items that you submit. Any information you disclose in your public activities, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by <strong>BMPL</strong> for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. If you choose to engage in public activities, you should be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected and used by other users of these areas. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in the course of your public activities and we have no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any of your public activities or submissions. For more information, see <a href="https://www.fortuneindia.com/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

              <p>Public activities may be included in our RSS feeds, APIs and other distribution formats. As a result, your public activities may appear on other websites, blogs, or feeds. Keep in mind that we are not responsible for any personal information you choose to make public via your public activities, and you agree that such sharing will be deemed to have been done by you, not <strong>BMPL</strong> including but not limited to sharing of information in your connected social media accounts.</p>

              <p>When you share or recommend links to content on a third-party platform (such as Facebook, Google+ and Twitter), that action and any information you share will be covered by their privacy policy.</p>

              <p><strong>Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers<br>
                  BMPL</strong> collects personal information from you when you participate in sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information is also being collected by a third party other than <strong>BMPL</strong>, we will notify you at the same time. If you do not want any personal information shared, you should not participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer.</p>

              <p><strong>Reader Surveys, Reader Panels and Market Research</strong><br>
                <strong>BMPL</strong> may collect personal information from you in connection with voluntary surveys conducted via <strong>BMPL</strong>. Data may be collected through <strong>BMPL</strong>, on the phone or through the mail. The information you provide may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.<br>
                Members of our Reader Panels agree to participate in surveys, polls or discussions about their readership of <strong>BMPL</strong>, their household/personal characteristics and their purchase behavior.</p>

              <p><strong>Conferences and Live Events</strong><br>
                We often receive information about attendees to our live events from sign-in and registration lists. We may share this information with event or promotion&nbsp;sponsors, in which case we will notify you when we collect the information.</p>

              <p><strong><em>Non-Personal Information Collected Using Technology</em></strong></p>

              <p><strong>Information Collected by Us Using Technology</strong></p>

              <p>We use various internet technologies to manage <strong>BMPL</strong> and track use of the Services. Non-personal information that we collect using these technologies may be combined with other information about you.</p>

              <p><strong>Device Information.</strong>&nbsp;We may collect non-personal information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access <strong>BMPL</strong>, such as IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language and other transactional information.</p>

              <p><strong>Cookies, Beacons, Local Storage and Other Similar Technologies.</strong>&nbsp;We use "cookies," web beacons, tags and scripts, and other similar technologies including local storage objects such as HTML5. These technologies allow us to manage access to and use of the Services, recognize you and provide personalization, and help us understand how people use <strong>BMPL</strong>. You will not be able to access certain areas of our websites, including <strong>BMPL</strong>, if your computer does not accept cookies from us. We do not respond to browser-based "do not track" signals. For more detailed information about our use of cookies and local storage, and how to manage them, see&nbsp;<em>Fortune India’s Cookie Policy </em>at end of this page.</p>

              <p>We may transmit non-personally identifiable website usage information to third parties in order to show you advertising for <strong>BMPL</strong> when you visit other sites. For more information about our third-party ad server, or to learn your choices about not having this non-personal information used to target ads to you, please&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/">click here</a>.</p>

              <p><strong>Local Storage Objects</strong></p>

              <p>We may use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML5 or Flash to collect and store information.</p>

              <p><strong>Analytics, Log Files and Reading History</strong></p>

              <p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses (the region or general location where your computer or device is accessing the internet), browser type, operating system and other usage information about the use of <strong>BMPL</strong>, including a history of the pages you view.</p>

              <p>We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, including customized Recommendations, advertising and currency display, to improve marketing, and to track access and use of &nbsp;<strong>BMPL</strong> across the devices that you use to access <strong>BMPL</strong>.</p>


              <p>We have hired third parties to provide us information, reports and analysis about the usage, browsing patterns of our users. They may independently record the type of device and operating system you are using, general location information, as well as events that occur within our apps, such as how often you use our apps.</p>

              <p><strong>Location Information.</strong>&nbsp;Some of our mobile applications can deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature of the app. If you enable the location-based feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device, which will then be used by the app. If you elect to have a location-based search saved to your history, we will store that information on our servers. If you do not enable the location-based service, or if an app does not have that feature, the app will not transmit to us, and we will not collect or store, location information.</p>

              <p>The ads in our apps are not targeted to you based on your current GPS location, but they may be targeted to you based on your ZIP code or device's IP address.</p>

              <p><strong>Third Parties</strong></p>

              <p>Some of the services and advertisements included in <strong>BMPL</strong>, including on <strong>BMPL</strong> and within our mobile apps, are delivered or served by third-party companies, which may collect information about your use of <strong>BMPL</strong>.</p>

              <p>These companies may place or recognize cookies, web beacons or other technology to track certain non-personal information about our website users. For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, an advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of <strong>BMPL</strong>. For another example, an advertiser or ad server may also be able to collect your device’s unique identifier in the course of serving an ad. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests.</p>

              <p>We do not have access to, nor control over, these third parties' use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used. For example, we use Google to serve advertisements onto <strong>BMPL</strong>, which use the Google Doubleclick cookie, and in some cases, a unique device identifier, to show you ads based on your visit to <strong>BMPL</strong> and other sites on the internet. You may opt out of the use of the Google Doubleclick cookie by visiting the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>.</p>

              <p>You have choices about the collection of information by third parties on our website. If you would like to opt-out of having interest-based ad targeting,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">click here</a>.</p>

              <p>Your access to our websites should not be affected if you do not accept cookies served by third parties.</p>

              <p><strong>Fortune India’s Cookie Policy</strong></p>

              <p>BMPL is committed to being transparent about how we use cookies on our sites and the technologies that underpin their collection and usage.</p>


              <p><strong>Why cookies are important</strong></p>

              <p>Cookies help make your online experience more efficient and relevant to your interests. For instance, they are used to remember your preferences on sites you visit often, to remember your user ID and the contents of your shopping baskets, and to help you navigate between pages more efficiently.</p>


              <p>Please read below for more detail.</p>


              <ul>
                <li><strong>What is a cookie?</strong></li>
              </ul>

              <p>A cookie is a small file, or files on your computer, phone, or other device with a browser to save snippets of text for reference by the website you are visiting.</p>

              <p>All cookies have expiration dates in them that determine how long they stay in your browser.</p>


              <ul>
                <li><strong>Session cookies</strong></li>
              </ul>

              <p>These are temporary cookies that expire (and are automatically erased) whenever you close your browser. For example, we use session cookies to grant access to content and enable commenting (things you have to log in to do).</p>

              <ul>
                <li style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white;"><strong>Persistent cookies</strong>&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>

              <p>These usually have an expiration date and so stay in your browser until they expire, or until you manually delete them. For example we use persistent cookies for functionality including the "Stay logged-in" tick box. We also use persistent cookies to better understand usage patterns so that we can improve the site for our customers.</p>



              <p>We've included more details below to help you understand what kinds of cookies and other technologies we use.</p>



              <p><strong>Other technologies linked to cookies</strong></p>

              <p>There are other technologies which can seem similar to cookies, but are not the same, including pixels and site tags. These pixels or tags can be used to retrieve information such as your device type or operating system, IP address, time of visit, etc. (Please see our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fortuneindia.com/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp;for more details on the types of information that may be collected.)
