                    <p>Protecting the privacy  and safeguarding the personal and financial information of our clients  and website visitors is one of our highest priorities. The following  Privacy Statement explains how ForexMeta collects and protects your  information.</p>
<p>By opening a ForexMeta  or by using the ForexMeta site, you give your consent to the collection  and use of personal information by ForexMeta as explained in this  privacy statement.<br>
Collection of personal information We collect information  required to open an account, to transact business effectively and to  safeguard your privacy. To do this, we gather information to help us  assess your needs and preferences.</p>
<p>The information we collect directly from you  includes information required to communicate with you, including your  name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address; and, as  required by law, to identify who you are, including Social Security or  Passport/Tax ID number; address, etc. We also collect demographic  information when you open an account, including gender, birth date,  education, occupation, etc. Our regulatory bodies also require us to  assess your trading experience, your approximate annual income,  approximate net worth, and available risk capital to assess your  financial position.</p>
<p>You  directly provide to us the majority of information we collect. You do  this by completing the account application and related documentation,  placing a trade, sending us an e-mail, or submitting information in  response to a promotion or special offer. Other ways we obtain  information are by (1) observing your usage of the Web site, and (2)  providing products and services to you. This information enables us to  offer you products and services that should be of interest to you.The  information we collect indirectly from you includes your Internet  Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, Internet Service  Provider (ISP), time stamps, transactions placed, and banner ads you  click. We do this through the use of cookies, which are small text files  sent from the Web server to your computer. Cookies help us to know you  better by providing operational data we can use to aid your interaction  with our Web site and improve its navigation and usability.</p>
<p>Usage of personal  information We use personal information only as appropriate to provide  you quality service and security. For example, ForexMeta may use the  information collected from you to verify your identity and contact  information. We may also use this information to establish and set up  your trading account, issue an account number and a secure password,  maintain your account activity, and contact you with account  information. This information helps us improve our services to you,  customize your browsing experience and inform you about additional  products, services or promotions that may be of interest to you.<br>
Should you close your  account with us, ForexMeta will retain your information, but only use it  to comply with regulatory requirements and to periodically contact you  to offer you the opportunity to reactivate your account or participate  in other valuable offers.</p>
<p>ForexMeta may share information with  affiliates if the information is required to provide the product or  service you have requested or to provide you the opportunity to  participate in the products or services our affiliates offer. ForexMeta  also forges partnerships and alliances, which may include joint  marketing agreements, with other companies who offer high-quality  products and services that might be of value to our clients. In order to  ensure that these products and services meet your needs and are  delivered in a manner that is useful and relevant, ForexMeta may share  some information with partners, affiliates and alliances. This allows  them to better understand the offers that are most relevant and useful.  In our strategic relationships, we will require that it be identified  that an offer is being extended because of the relationship with us. The  use of your personal information is limited to the purposes identified  in our relationship with the partner or affiliate.</p>
<p>Non-affiliated third  parties ForexMeta does not sell, license, lease or otherwise disclose  your personal information to any third party for any reason, except as  described below.</p>
<p>ForexMeta  reserves the right to disclose your personal information to third  parties where required by law to regulatory, law enforcement or other  government authorities. We may also disclose your information as  necessary to credit reporting or collection agencies, or when necessary  to protect our rights or property.<br>
To help us improve our services to you,  we may engage another business to help us to carry out certain internal  functions such as account processing, fulfillment, client service,  client satisfaction surveys or other data collection activities relevant  to our business. We may also provide a party with client information  from our database to help us to analyze and identify client needs and  notify clients of product and service offerings. Use of the information  shared is strictly limited to the performance of the task we request and  for no other purpose. All third parties with which we share personal  information are required to protect personal information in a manner  similar to the way we protect personal information. Examples of  information shared are identifying information such as name, mailing  address, e-mail address, telephone number, and information on account  activity.</p>
<p>If at any time you  choose to purchase a product or service offered by another company, any  personal information you share with that company will no longer be  controlled under our Privacy Statement. We are not responsible for the  privacy policies or the content of sites we link to and have no control  of the use or protection of information provided by you or collected by  those sites. Whenever you elect to link to a co-branded Web site or to a  linked Web site, you may be asked to provide registration or other  information. Please note that the information you are providing is going  to a third party, and you should familiarize yourself with the privacy  policy provided by that third party.</p>
<p>Opting out of disclosures of non-public  personal information You may direct us not to disclose non-public  personal information to certain non-affiliated third parties. To opt out  of sharing non-public personal information with non-affiliated third  parties, please contact a client service representative. An opt out  election made by one account owner of a Joint account is applicable to  all account owners of the Joint account. An opt-out election must be  made for each separate account you hold at ForexMeta.</p>
<p>If we propose to share  information in a manner not covered in this Privacy Statement, we will  notify you of this change by posting an addendum on the Web site, a  notice in the âAbout Usâ section of the Web site, and if appropriate,  provide you an opportunity to opt out of such use.</p>
<p>The security of your  personal information We employ leading-edge security software, systems,  and procedures to offer you a safe and secure trading environment and  protect your personal, financial and trading information.</p>
<p>When you open an  account with us, you are issued a unique account number, User ID and a  password. Only a limited number of ForexMetaâs employees who have a need  to know this information will have access to your account number,  UserID, and password. Remember: you are ultimately responsible for  maintaining the secrecy of your account number, UserID, and password. We  strongly recommend that you do not disclose this information.</p>
<p>Use of âcookiesâ We  use cookies to assist us in securing your trading activities and to  enhance the performance of our Web site. (Cookies are small text files  sent from the Web server to your computer.) Cookies used by ForexMeta do  not contain any personal information nor do they contain account or  password information. They merely allow the site to recognize that a  page request comes from someone who has already logged on.</p>
<p>ForexMeta may share  Web site usage information about visitors to the Web site with reputable  advertising companies for targeting our Internet banner advertisements  on this site and other sites. For this purpose, pixel tags (also called  clear gifs or web beacons) may be used to note the pages youâve visited.  The information collected by the advertising company through the use of  these pixel tags is not personally identifiable.</p>
<p>To administer and  improve the ForexMeta Web site, we may use a third party to track and  analyze usage and volume statistical information, including page  requests, form requests, and click paths. The third party may use  cookies to track behavior and may set cookies on behalf of ForexMeta.  These cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information.</p>
<h2>Changes to this  Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>In the event ForexMeta materially changes this  Privacy Statement, the revised Privacy Statement will promptly be posted  to the Web sites and we will post a notice on our Web sites informing  you of such changes. You agree to accept posting of a revised Privacy  Statement electronically on the Web site as actual notice to you. Any  dispute over our Privacy Statement is subject to this notice and the  ForexMeta Customer Agreement. If you have any questions that this  statement does not address, please contact a Client Services  representative.</p>

	<p style="padding:0 40px; margin-top:0;">HIGH RISK WARNING: Foreign exchange trading carries a high level of risk that may not be suitable for all investors.

You could lose some or all of your initial investment; do not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. Educate yourself on the risks associated with <a href="http://www.forexmeta.com/">foreign exchange trading</a>, and seek advice from an independent financial or tax advisor if you have any questions. The spreads are not fixed and may fluctuate with market volatility. At times they may widen above 2 pips on major pairs. <a href="#" class="riskdisclosure cboxElement" rel="nofollow">Read Full Disclosure</a>

        <h3>Risk Disclosure</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.forexmeta.com/">Trading foreign currencies</a> is a challenging and potentially profitable opportunity for educated and experienced investors. However, before deciding to participate in the <a href="http://www.forexmeta.com/">Forex market</a>, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite. Most importantly, do not invest money you cannot afford to lose. Please be aware of the risk involved in Forex trading.</p>

        <p>There is considerable exposure to risk in any off-exchange foreign exchange transaction, including, but not limited to, leverage, creditworthiness, limited regulatory protection and market volatility that may substantially affect the price, or liquidity of a currency or currency pair.</p>
        
        <p>More over, the leveraged nature of forex trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds. This may work against you as well as for you. The possibility exists that you could sustain a total loss of initial margin funds and be required to deposit additional funds to maintain your position. If you fail to meet any margin requirement, your position may be liquidated and you will be responsible for any resulting losses. </p>
