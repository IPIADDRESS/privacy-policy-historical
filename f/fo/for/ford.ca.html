<p><strong><em>Vehicle Data Recorders</em></strong><br>
  Service data recorders in your vehicle are capable of collecting and storing diagnostic information about your vehicle. This potentially includes information about the performance or status of various systems and modules in the vehicle, such as engine, throttle, steering or brake systems. In order to properly diagnose and service your vehicle, both we and service and repair facilities may access vehicle diagnostic information through a direct connection to your vehicle when diagnosing or servicing your vehicle.</p>
<p>Other modules in your vehicle, event data recorders (EDR), are capable of collecting and storing data during a crash or near crash event. The recorded information may assist in the investigation of such an event. The modules may record information about both the vehicle and the occupants, potentially including information such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>how various systems in your vehicle were operating;
  </p></li>
  <li>
    <p>whether or not the driver and passenger seatbelts were buckled;
  </p></li>
  <li>
    <p>how far (if at all) the driver was depressing the accelerator and/or the brake pedal;
  </p></li>
  <li>
    <p>how fast the vehicle was traveling; and 
  </p></li>
  <li>
    <p>where the driver was positioning the steering wheel.
  </p></li>
</ul>
<p>To access EDR information, special equipment must be directly connected to the recording modules. <strong>We do not access EDR information without obtaining consent, unless pursuant to court order or where required by law enforcement, other government authorities or other third parties acting with lawful authority.</strong> Other parties may seek to access the information independently of us.</p>
<p>When you call our CRC or when we call you, it is our general practice to monitor and/or record such calls for staff training and quality assurance purposes.</p>
<p>Personal information is retained as long as required to fulfill these purposes. <strong>We have established retention policies and procedures to ensure that when the retention period expires, your personal information will be removed from our systems and destroyed in a secure manner.</strong></p>
<a name="types" class="Legal">&nbsp;</a>
<p><strong><u>Types of Customer Information We Collect and Use</u>:</strong></p>
<p>We collect the following types of customer information about you or relating to your automotive sales or service experience for the purposes set out above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>information which enables us to identify and communicate with you including name, address, phone number, e-mail address, language preference, and title
  </p></li>
  <li>
    <p>information which enables us to offer you products which better meet your needs including demographic such as birth date, education level, occupation, marital and family status, purchase preferences and interests
  </p></li>

    <p>information about your vehicle ownership including VIN, license plate number, applicable vehicle incentives, new or used, lease or purchase, any trade-in, odometer reading, make, model, model year and vehicle details, recalls, and customer notification programs, your selected dealer, and whether you have disposed of a Ford, Lincoln or Mercury vehicle

    <p>financial and credit information about you shared with us by Ford Credit when you have provided your consent
  </p></li>
</ul>
<a name="collect" class="Legal">&nbsp;</a>
<p><strong><u>How We Collect Customer Information</u>:</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Directly From You</strong></em><br>
  We obtain information directly from you such as when you complete our Customer Viewpoint surveys, participate in a contest, test drive, focus group or other promotion, campaign or event, purchase roadside assistance or extended service plan or contact our CRC. We may also obtain information directly from you through our website.</p>
<p><strong><em>From Our Dealers</em></strong><br>
  When you acquire a new or Quality Certified Ford, Lincoln or Mercury vehicle from our dealers, the dealer provides us with the following information about you and your vehicle to enable us to administer your purchase:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your name, address, telephone number, email address and language preference

  </p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you service your vehicle at our dealers, your dealer may also provide us with information regarding your service experience including your name, contact information, VIN, service date, and transactional information such as repair type, completion date, and odometer reading. </p>

<div id="fourWheelDrive" title="4WD, Four Wheel Drive">
    <p>A four-wheel drive (4WD) system helps give you traction on slippery driving surfaces or on rough, off-road terrain.</p>
    <p>The heart of a 4WD system is the transfer case — a secondary transmission assembly that is driven from the main transmission. The transfer case distributes power to both axles to drive all four wheels. It can be full-time, in which power is delivered to both axles at all times or part-time, where the driver selects two- or four-wheel drive. Four-wheel drive is often combined with independent suspension systems and off-road-type tires to enhance driveability on rough, off-road terrain, or on-road driveability in unfavorable driving conditions.</p>
</div>
<div id="advanceTrac" title="AdvanceTrac® wtih RSC®, AdvanceTrac®, AdvanceTrac RSC, AdvanceTrac">
    <p>AdvanceTrac® with RSC®, AdvanceTrac®    AdvanceTrac® with RSC® (Roll Stability Control™) helps you stay in control on slippery surfaces such as snow and ice, gravel, or rain-soaked roads.</p>
    <p>The patented AdvanceTrac® RSC® system uses a roll-rate sensor to measure roll motion at least 100 times per second, detecting unstable situations and reacting instantaneously to help keep the tires firmly planted.</p>
</div>
<div id="abs" title="anti-lock braking system, abs">
    <p>Anti-Lock Braking System, ABS   The four-wheel Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) used by Ford helps provide straight, more controlled stops, while helping the driver maintain steering control under most road conditions, including slippery road surfaces.</p>
    <p>Sensors continuously monitor the speed of each wheel. When impending wheel lockup is detected, the computer signals the hydraulic control unit to apply and release (automatically pumping) the brakes several times per second with split-second timing, providing a level of braking efficiency that even professional race car drivers cannot duplicate, and resulting in shorter stopping distances and greater braking and steering control.</p>
</div>
<div id="aPillar" title="a-pillar, apillar">
    <p>The first, most forward, roof support pillar located on either side of the windshield. Also known as windshield pillar or A-post.</p>
</div>
<div id="bPillar" title="b-pillar, bpillar">
    <p>The center roof support that divides the front and rear doors on four-door and wagon models. On two-door models, the B-pillar separates the door and rear quarter window/panel. On vans and club wagons, the B-pillar is behind the front doors.</p>
</div>
<div id="cPillar" title="c-pillar, cpillar">
    <p>The rear roof-supporting member on most vehicles. On station wagons, this pillar separates the rear doors and quarter panel glass.</p>
</div>
<div id="dPillar" title="d-pillar, dpillar">
    <p>The vertical, or sometimes diagonal, roof-support member at the extreme rear of the roof or greenhouse structure on wagons, minivans, sport utility vehicles, and some sedan body styles.</p>
</div>

<div id="atkinsonCycle" title="Atkinson-cycle">
<p>A type of internal combustion engine invented by James Atkinson in 1882. Ford uses the Atkinson-cycle engine to provide efficiency in the Escape Hybrid.</p>
<p>The Atkinson cycle, where the power stroke is longer than the compression stroke, provides increased fuel economy.</p>
</div>

<div id="awd" title="AWD, all-wheel drive">
<p>All-wheel drive (AWD) automatically splits engine torque between the front and rear wheels as needed, improving on-road traction in unfavorable road conditions.</p>
<p>Often confused with four-wheel drive (4WD), this drive system features four, full-time active drive wheels to reduce wheel slippage and provide greater driver control over the vehicle. Unlike 4WD, AWD is an on-road system and is not designed for off-road use. AWD does not require the driver to actively engage the system. It is operational at all times, and requires no switches, lights, or visor instructions for system operation.</p>
</div>

<div id="beltline" title="Beltline">
<p>A styling term that refers to the imaginary line going from the hood, which usually follows the bottom edge of the windows and continues to the trunk.</p>
</div>

<div id="beltMinderSystem" title="Belt-minder System">
<p>The Belt-Minder® System features an audible beep that drivers continue to hear if they neglect to buckle up after the initial federally required belt reminder stops chiming.</p>
</div>

<div id="blockerBeam" title="BlockerBeam">
<p>In the event of a frontal collision with a car, the BlockerBeam® is designed to make contact with the frame rails of a car. This helps to prevent the car from sliding beneath the higher-riding vehicle.</p>
</div>

<div id="chassis" title="Chassis">
<p>The portion of the vehicle that constitutes the functional elements that attach to the frame, including:</p>
<p></p><ul><li>Suspension</li><li>Steering components</li><li>Powertrain</li><li>Brakes</li><li>Fuel system</li></ul><p></p>
</div>

<div id="clearcoatPaint" title="Clearcoat paint">
<p>A paint type and process that provides a rich, lustrous finish that is easy to care for. The clearcoat paint process consists of acrylic enamel final coats.</p>
</div>

<div id="controlTrac" title="Control Trac® four-wheel drive">
<p>The Control Trac® System includes electronic logic and a full-featured, two-speed transfer case.</p>
<p>For Explorer four-door, the system is activated using push buttons on the instrument panel with three selections: 4x4 AUTO, 4x4 HIGH, and 4x4 LOW. </p>
<p>For Expedition, the system is activated using a rotary switch on the instrument panel with three positions: A4WD (four-wheel drive auto), 4H (four-wheel drive high), and 4L (four-wheel drive low).</p>
<p>4x4 AUTO (or A4WD) mode provides four-wheel drive with full power to the rear axle, and to the front axle as required for increased traction. This mode is appropriate for any driving, whether on dry pavement or in adverse conditions; though for extreme winter weather or off-road driving, a customer may choose to switch to 4x4 HIGH (4H) or 4x4 LOW (4L).</p>
<p>4x4 HIGH (4H) mode provides four-wheel drive with full power to both axles. It is only intended for severe winter or off-road conditions, such as deep snow and ice (where no pavement remains uncovered), and shallow sand. 4x4 HIGH should never be used on dry pavement, as the vehicle will bind when going around corners.</p>
<p>4x4 LOW (4L) mode supplies four-wheel drive with full power to both axles and includes a lower gear ratio for low speeds. It is only intended for off-road applications that require extra power including deep sand, steep grades, and when pulling a boat and trailer out of water. 4x4 LOW should never be used on dry pavement, as the vehicle will bind when going around corners.</p>
<p>Only the Explorer four-door automatic models can be retrofitted with a Neutral Tow Kit through a Ford dealer to allow the transfer case to be shifted to neutral. This permits the vehicle to be flat towed for extended distances (such as behind a motor home) without risking damage to the automatic transmission. The Expedition does not have this capability.</p>
</div>

<div id="crumpleZone" title="Crumple zone">
<p>Sections of a vehicle body and/or frame engineered to progressively deform in a collision, thereby absorbing impact forces instead of transferring them to the passenger compartment.</p>
</div>

<div id="displacement" title="Displacement, L, litre">
<p>Litres: the common metric measurement of engine displacement.</p>
<p>Engine displacement is the measure of the total cylindrical volume through which the pistons of an engine move from one end of the stroke to the other. The formula to determine the displacement of an engine is:</p>
<p>Displacement = .7854 x Bore x Bore x Stroke x Number of Cylinders</p>
<p>For example: the displacement of the 4.6L V-8 (281-cid) engine is: 280.3 (0.7854 x 3.55 x 3.55 x 3.54 x 8).</p>
</div>

<div id="drivetrain" title="Drivetrain ">
<p>Also called the driveline or powertrain, it includes all power-transmitting components that generate power and deliver it to the road surface. These components include the engine, transmission, clutch, transaxle/transmission, and drive axle.</p>
</div>

<p>A supercharger increases the horsepower of an internal combustion engine. </p>
<p>A supercharger (blower) is a gas compressor that forces more air and thus more oxygen into the combustion chamber(s) producing more power than is achievable with ambient atmospheric pressure. The additional mass of oxygen-containing air forced into the engine improves its volumetric efficiency, allowing it to burn more fuel in a given cycle and thereby produce more power. </p>
<p>A supercharger can be powered mechanically by belt, gear, and shaft, or chain-driven from the engine's crankshaft. It can also be driven by a gas turbine powered by the exhaust gases from the engine. Such turbine-driven centrifugal superchargers are correctly known as turbo-superchargers, or more commonly, turbochargers.</p>
