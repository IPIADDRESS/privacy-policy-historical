Here are some examples of the ways in which we may collect and store your personally identifiable information through our services:</p><ul><li><p>we may collect your email address, first and last name, and zip code, if you sign up for an online newsletter;</p></li><li><p>we may collect your email address if you contact us with a question;</p></li><li><p>we may collect your first and last name, date of birth, and email address if you choose to participate in a contest or sweepstakes; and</p></li><li><p>we may collect your first and last name, your address, and your credit card and billing information to enable you to make a purchase.</p></li></ul><p>"Non-personally identifiable information" can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, gender, or interests. Non-personally identifiable information does not identify you personally. If you do provide us with non-personally identifiable information, we may use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or where it is collected, or any other legal purpose.</p><p>Here are some examples of the ways in which we may collect and store your non-personally identifiable information through our services, and how we use such information:</p><ul><li><p>Internet Protocol (IP) address. Your "IP address" is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data, such as the screens and pages of our services that you view. We use this information to deliver our screens and pages to you upon request, to tailor our services to the interests of you and our other visitors, and to measure traffic to and within our services.</p></li><li><p>Cookie. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on our services. For example, when you visit a screen or page on our services, a cookie is placed on your machine (if you or your browser accept the cookie). This cookie may then be read by screen or pages on our services. You may configure your browser to notify you or to reject and block cookies, but if you do, you may not have access to some areas of our services, or to the personalized features of our services.</p></li><li><p>Web Beacon. A "web beacon", "clear gif", "web bug", or "pixel tag" is a tiny graphic file with a unique identifier, that is similar in function to a cookie, but allows us to count the number of users that have visited certain pages or screens of our services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which may be stored on your computer's hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on pages or screens.</p></li><li><p>Demographic Information. "Demographic information" may be your gender, age, zip code, and interests. We may collect such information about your through our services and use it to provide you with personalized services and to analyze trends to ensure that our services and the information on them is targeted to meet your needs. Please note that we also consider aggregated information, which is not personally identifiable, to be non-personally identifiable information.</p></li></ul><p>If you encounter a screen or page that requests information you do not want to share with us, do not enter the information and do not proceed with that screen or page.</p><p><b>C. USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH OUR SERVICES</b></p><p><b>Personally identifiable information.</b> If you do provide us with personally identifiable information, we will only use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or where it is collected. Primarily, we use it on our services to:</p><ul><li><p>help us create and public content most relevant to you;</p></li><li><p>allow you access to certain areas of our services;</p></li><li><p>register you as a user and develop your profile and enable you to take advantage of our the personalized features of our services;</p></li><li><p>deliver services, such as information, newsletters, or software that you request or purchase;</p></li><li><p>alert you to special officers, updated information, and our other new services or those of other third-parties;</p></li><li><p>forward promotional materials and to fulfill the terms of such promotion;</p></li><li><p>complete a transaction or service requested by you;</p></li><li><p>target our services to your needs;</p></li><li><p>identify you as a poster or provider of content; and</p></li><li><p>contact you in response to sign up forms such as "Contact Us" or "Order Inquiry".</p></li></ul><p><b>Non-personally identifiable information. </b>We may use non-personally identifiable information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or where it is collected, or any other legal purpose, including, when and where applicable, combining non-personally identifiable information with personally identifiable information.</p><p><b>D. SHARING AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH OUR SERVICES</b></p><p><b>Personally identifiable information.</b> Primarily, we may share or disclose your personally identifiable information in the following instances:</p><ul><li><p><b>To fulfill a service to you.&nbsp;</b>For example, if you choose to download an application, we may share your
personally identifiable information to provide the application to you. Also, if
you are entering a sweepstakes or contest, we may use your personally
identifiable information to fulfill the terms of that promotion, including for
prize fulfillment purposes or with mail carriers. We also may share your
information with co-sponsors of such promotion.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><b style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>To let us offer you products from our affiliates, strategic partners,
agents, or from third-party marketers and other unaffiliated parties that we

fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions).&nbsp;</strong>We seek to ensure that such
unaffiliated third-parties will not use your personally identifiable
information for any purpose other than that for which they are responsible.
However, we cannot guarantee that they will not use it for any other purpose.</p></li><li><p><b style="font-weight: bold;">To complete your purchase.&nbsp;</b>If you choose to make a purchase on or through our services, we may ask
you for your credit card number, billing address, and other information in
connection with completing such purchase, and we may use such information to
fulfill your purchase. We may also provide such information, or other
personally identifiable information provided by you, to unaffiliated
third-parties to complete your purchase (for example, to process your credit card).</p></li><li><p><b style="font-weight: bold;"><b>To comply with law</b>, </b>or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the requirements of law, or comply with legal process served on us, and to protect and defend our rights or property and our services, or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of you and our other visitors.</p></li><li><p><b style="font-weight: bold;"><b>To third parties as part of a corporate reorganization process</b> including, </b>but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.</p></li><li><p><b style="font-weight: bold;"><b>To track and analyze non-identifying, aggregate usage and volume statistical information</b> </b>from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.</p></li><li><p><b style="font-weight: bold;">To protect against fraud and potential fraud. </b>We may verify the information provided by you on our services through third parties. In the course of such verification, we may receive additional personally identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, if you use a credit card or debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address match the information you supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.</p></li></ul><p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Non-personally identifiable information. </b>We may share and disclose your non-personally identifiable information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or where it is collected, or any other legal purpose, including, when and where applicable, sharing and disclosing non-personally identifiable information combined with personally identifiable information.</p><pclass="msonormal" style="margin-bottom: 7.5pt; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><strong>E.

RESIDENTS - YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></p><p>(As provided by
California Civil Code Section 1798.83)</p><p>A California USA resident
who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has
established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes
("California customer") is entitled to request information about
whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties
for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business
has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request
by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all
third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar
year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were
disclosed.</p><p>However, under the
law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the
business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy ) a policy
of not disclosing customer's personal information to third parties for their
direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the
disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy.
Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his
or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost
free means to exercise that right.</p><p>As stated in our
Privacy Policy, we do not share information with third parties for their direct
marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure --
typically by opting-in to receive information from a third party. To prevent
disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third
party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personal information on our service.
Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a
third party, your information will be subject to the third-party's privacy
policies and practices. If you later decide that you do not want that third
party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party
directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You
should always review the privacy policies and practices of any party that
collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your
information.</p><p>California customers may request further
information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing
privacy@forbestravelguide.com Please note that we are only required to respond
to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to
requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.</p><p><strong>CALIFORNIA
DO NOT TRACK NOTICE: </strong></p><p>Some browsers have a "Do Not Track"
