  <div class="content">
    <p>
      <b>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.</b></p>
    <p>
      It explains how The Five Star Travel Corporation and/or its
      subsidiary and affiliated entities (collectively, "Startle", "we", "us", or "our") collects information about you

      PRACTICES AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS OUR WEBSITES.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>A. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Scope.</b> This Privacy Policy applies to all of the websites where it is posted. Additional terms and conditions
      may apply to some services offered on the websites. Such terms and conditions may be found at the place on the
      websites where the relevant service is offered. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we may collect from
      you or about you in other ways, including through emails you may send to us.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Updates to the Privacy Policy.</b> We may update this Privacy Policy at any time, with or without advance notice.
      In the event there are significant changes in the way we treat your personally identifiable information, or in the
      Privacy Policy terms and conditions, we will display a notice on the website or send you an email, so that you may
      review the changed terms prior to continuing to use the website. If you object to any of the changes to the Privacy

      Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. Using the websites after a notice
      of changes has been sent to you or published on our website shall constitute consent to the changed terms or
      practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Collection and Use of Information from Minors and Children Under the Age of 13</b> . If you are a minor, please be
      sure to get your parents to review and discuss this Privacy Policy with you, and get their permission, before using
      our websites. We encourage parents to talk about what information their children should and shouldn't share online,
      and other restrictions about the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know. We hope that our
      privacy practices as described in this Privacy Policy will remove any concerns that parents may have about their

    <p>
      <b>Your California Privacy Rights.</b> Residents of the State of California, please also read statement below titled
      âYour California Privacy Rightsâ to understand additional rights you may have pursuant to California Civil Code
      Section 1798.83.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>B. INFORMATION WE COLLECT THROUGH OUR WEBSITES</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      We collect two types of information from you and other visitors to our websites: (1) "personally identifiable
      information" (as described below) and (2) non-personally identifiable information (as described below).
    </p>

    <p>
      "Personally identifiable information" is information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address,
      telephone number, email address, or company name. Here are some examples of the ways in which we may collect and store
      your personally identifiable information through our websites:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          we may collect your email address, first and last name, and zip code, if you sign up for an online newsletter;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          we may collect your email address if you contact us with a question;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          we may collect your first and last name, date of birth, and email address if you choose to participate in a
          contest or sweepstakes; and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          we may collect your first and last name, your address, and your credit card and billing information to enable you
          to make a purchase.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      "Non-personally identifiable information" can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as
      your age, gender, or interests. Non-personally identifiable information does not identify you personally. If you do
      provide us with non-personally identifiable information, we may use it for the purposes described in this Privacy
      Policy or where it is collected, or any other legal purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are some examples of the ways in which we may collect and store your non-personally identifiable information
      through our websites, and how we use such information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Internet Protocol (IP) address. Your "IP address" is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know
          where to send you data, such as the screens and pages of our websites that you view. We use this information to
          deliver our screens and pages to you upon request, to tailor our websites to the interests of you and our other
          visitors, and to measure traffic to and within our websites.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cookie. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on our
          websites. For example, when you visit a screen or page on our websites, a cookie is placed on your machine (if you
          or your browser accept the cookie). This cookie may then be read by screen or pages on our websites. You may
          configure your browser to notify you or to reject and block cookies, but if you do, you may not have access to
          some areas of our websites, or to the personalized features of our websites.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Web Beacon. A "web beacon", "clear gif", "web bug", or "pixel tag" is a tiny graphic file with a unique
          identifier, that is similar in function to a cookie, but allows us to count the number of users that have visited
          certain pages or screens of our websites, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising
          campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email
          has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which may be stored on your computer's hard drive, web beacons are
          typically embedded invisibly on pages or screens.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Demographic Information. "Demographic information" may be your gender, age, zip code, and interests. We may
          collect such information about your through our websites and use it to provide you with personalized services and
          to analyze trends to ensure that our websites and services and the information on them is targeted to meet your
          needs. Please note that we also consider aggregated information, which is not personally identifiable, to be
          non-personally identifiable information.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you encounter a screen or page that requests information you do not want to share with us, do not enter the
      information and do not proceed with that screen or page.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>C. USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH OUR WEBSITES</b>

      described in this Privacy Policy or where it is collected, or any other legal purpose, including, when and where
      applicable, combining non-personally identifiable information with personally identifiable information.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>To offer you products from our affiliates, strategic partners, agents, or from third-party marketers and other
            unaffiliated parties that we believe may be of interest to you, or to assist such parties for research,

      We may transfer information that we collect about you, including personally identifiable information, to subsidiary
      and affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other
      countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws
      governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring information
      about you, including personally identifiable information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same
      data protection laws as the European Union, and you consent to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>

      that there be no further collection or use of their child's information, by contacting us through our Contact page. We
      take steps to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child, to ensure that the person is in fact
      the child's parent or guardian, and appreciate your cooperation with those steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>G. OPT-OUT</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      We communicate with our registered users on a regular basis via email and through other features on our websites. For
      example, we may use your email address to confirm your request, to send you notice of payments, to send you
      information about changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law.
      Generally, users cannot opt-out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather
      than promotional.
    </p>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>

    </ul>
    <p>
      You may exercise your opt-out by ticking or un-ticking the appropriate box, if available, where such information is
      collected, or by contacting us. We will process your opt-out as soon as possible, but please be aware that in some
      circumstances you may receive additional messages until your request is processed. You also may opt-out of receiving
      such emails by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link within the text of the applicable email or by modifying your user
      account settings. If you object to the privacy preference or opt-out alternatives made available for the website, and

      This Privacy Policy was last updated on September 13, 2011.

      <b>CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS â YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      (As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)
    </p>

    <p>
      A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business
      relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information
      about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct
      marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a
      request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal
      information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information
      that were disclosed.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and
      discloses to the public (in its privacy policy ) a policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third
      parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long
      as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the
      customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise
      that right.
    </p>

    <p>
      As stated in our Privacy Policy, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes
      unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure -- typically by opting-in to receive information from a third party.
      To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such
      use when you provide personal information on our website. Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future
      communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third-party's privacy policies and
      practices. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact
      the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the
      privacy policies and practices of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle
      your information.
    </p>

    <p>
      California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing
      privacy@startle.com. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we
      are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.
