      <p>We may use third parties to present or serve advertisements, including online behavioral advertisements, that you may see on the Services and to conduct research about the advertisements-or the Services themselves.  Additionally, third parties may place and use tracking mechanisms, e.g., tracking pixels, in the emails we may send to you. This Privacy Policy  does not cover any use of information that such third parties may have collected from you (e.g., type of browser, operating system, domain name, day and time of visit, page(s) visited) or the methods used by the third-parties to collect that information (e.g., cookies, web beacons and clear gifs).</p>

    <div>
        <h4 id="cookies">Cookies and other Tracking Technologies</h4>

        <p>We may place "cookies" on your computer or device. Cookies are small text files that we place in your computer or device to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personal information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering with one of our Services. Once you choose to provide us with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.  A cookie assigns a unique numerical identifier to your Web browser or device, and may enable us to recognize you as the same user who has used our Services, and relate your use of the Services to other information about you, such as your usage information and personal information.</p>

        <p>We use cookies (and Local Shared Objects, HTML5, cache cookies, web beacons, or clear gifs, all described further below) to understand usage of the Services and to improve our content and offerings and to deliver advertisements that you might be interested in. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience on our Services (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site, to save your password in password-protected areas, to enable shopping carts, or to tailor content or product and service offerings).</p>

        <p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies. You can set your browser option so that you will not receive cookies and you can also delete existing cookies from your browser. However, you may find that some parts of the site will not function properly if you have refused cookies or similar tracking technologies and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar tracking technologies might prevent you from accessing some of our content. However, your viewing of editorial content may be hampered. If you wish to block cookies, go to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a> to find out how, or check your browser's instructions.</p>

        <p>Some of the tracking technologies we use include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Local Shared Objects: Local shared objects, such as .Flash cookies,. also may be stored on your computer or device.  Local shared objects operate a lot like cookies, but cannot be managed in the same way.  Depending on how local shared objects are enabled on your computer or device, you may be able to manage them using software settings.  For information on managing Flash cookies, for example, see <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html" target="_blank">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html</a>.</li>

        <li>HTML 5:  HTML5, the language some Web sites are coded in, may be used to store information on your computer or device about your Service usage activities.  This information may be retrieved by us to help us manage our Services, such as by giving us information about how our Services are being used by our visitors, how they can be improved, and to customize them for our users.</li>

        <li>Cache Cookies:  Cache cookies, such as eTags, may be used to identify your computer or device as the same computer or device that visited a Service or Services in the past.</li>

        <li>Web Beacons:  Our websites may also use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. A web beacon is an electronic image called a single-pixel or clear GIF. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information, such as a user's cookie number, time and date of a page view, and description of the page where the web beacon is placed. These web beacons may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our cookie policy above.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These tracking technologies may be deployed by us and/or by our service providers or partners on our behalf. These technologies enable us to assign a unique number to you, and relate your Service usage information to other information about you, including your personal information.  We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both personal information and Service usage information, and use such information along with offline and online information obtained from other sources (including third parties) such as demographic information and updated contact information (where that information has been lawfully disclosed to us) for the purposes of learning more about you so we can provide you with relevant content.</p>

        <p class="top"><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

        <h4 id="security">Our Commitment to Security</h4>

        <p>We have put in place appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use the information we collect. No system can be completely secure, however, and we do not guarantee that unauthorized disclosures and access will not happen. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. </p>

     <div style="display:none">
     </div>

    <div>
        <h4 id="access">Accessing, Correcting, and Deleting Your Personal Information</h4>

        <p>We will take reasonable steps to accurately record the personal information that you provide to us pursuant to this Privacy Policy and any subsequent updates to such information..</p>

        <p>We encourage you to review, update, and correct the personal information that you provide to us pursuant to this Privacy Policy. You may request that we delete such personal information about you that is inaccurate, incomplete, or irrelevant for legitimate purposes, or that is being processed in a way which infringes upon any applicable legal requirements, by contacting us as set out in the "How to Contact Us" section below.  At our election, instead of deleting such information, we may retain it with your comment or correction noted in our records.  By contacting us, you may also object to our further use of your personal information if you have compelling legitimate grounds  (this may involve closing your account).  We may ask you to verify your identity and to provide other details before we are able to provide you with any information, correct any inaccuracies, or delete any information.  Your right to review, update, correct, and delete your personal information may be limited, subject to the law or your jurisdiction: (i) if your requests are abusive or unreasonably excessive, (ii) where the rights or safety of another person or persons would be encroached upon, or (iii) if the information or material you request relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between you and us, or providing access to you would prejudice negotiations between us or an investigation of possible unlawful activity.  Your right to review, update, correct and delete your information is subject to our records retention policies and applicable law, including any statutory retention requirements.</p>

        <h4 id="retention">Retention of Personal Information</h4>

        <p>We will retain your personal information while you have an account with us and thereafter for as long as we need it for purposes not prohibited by applicable laws.  Thereafter, we will either delete your personal information or de-identify it so that it is anonymous and not attributed to your identity.  Your rights to request that we delete your personal information are set forth in the <b>"Accessing, Correcting, and Deleting Your Personal Information"</b> section above.</p>

        <h4 id="parents">Special Note for Parents</h4>

        <p>The site you are visiting is not intended for use by children, especially those under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.</p>

The revised Privacy Policy will be posted on the appropriate portion(s) of our websites or mobile applications. We encourage you to periodically check back to review this policy so that you know what information we collect, how we use it and with whom we share it.</p>
