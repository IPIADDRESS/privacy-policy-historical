also decide not to provide information that is designated as "optional" on any application,

personal information. You may access and edit your registration information by using your

User Name (your email address) and password. If you have forgotten your password,

please click the "Forgot Password?" link to have password reset instructions emailed to

you.</p><p style="float: left;" id="w493">Where Formistry is deployed on behalf of Clients, Universities, Colleges or Institutions,

GreenClouds has no direct relationship with the individuals/ applicants/ candidates whose

personal data is processed on Formistry. An individual/ applicant/ candidate who seeks

access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct her/his

query to the Client, Universities, Colleges or Institutions (the data controller). If the Client

requests GreenClouds to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 7

business days.</p><p style="float: left;" id="w494">In case of data collected directly by GreenClouds on Formistry the individual who seeks

access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query

to the Formistry support team at privacyquestions@formistry.com. We will respond to your

request within a reasonable timeframe. The change will be effected in 7 working days.</p><p style="float: left;" id="w495">Your User Registration information is password-protected. You may edit your User

Registration information by using your User Name (your email address) and password.</p><p style="float: left;" id="w496">We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Also remember to sign

out of your Formistry registration account and close your browser window when you have

finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information

and correspondence if you share a computer or other electronic device with someone else

or are using a computer or other electronic device in a public place like a library or Internet

"cafe." Also, to help ensure the security of your application, do not copy and paste links

from within the online application into an email or share with others on a public forum. If

you do not log out of the online system, users with technical knowledge may use these

links to access your online application.</p><p style="float: left;" id="w497">When you make submissions through Formistry, supplements or other applicant forms

directly on the website or through Client, Colleges, Universities or Institutions or when you

access your user registered account information from our Website, or our mobile app, or

when you give us your permission to share certain of your personal information with Test

Pre and Other organisations for the purpose of participating in tests/programs/

assessments, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software encrypts all

information you input before it is sent to us. We also restrict access to the secure server

through the use of firewalls.</p><p style="float: left;" id="w498">When you provide your personal information on Formistry’s online application, this

information is accessed by the Client, Colleges, Universities or Institutions that have

deployed the Formistry application. Consequently, your personal information can then be

viewed, printed and/or exported electronically to the Client, Colleges, Universities or

Institutions which are located outside and separate from the Formistry web site and

outside of the jurisdiction and perhaps country where you originally entered the

information.</p><h2 class=" text-h2" id="w428">Payments</h2><p style="float: left;" id="w499">Formistry is integrated with authorized bank or payment gateway providers to enable

applicants/ candidates to pay application and other fees online. We DO NOT store credit

card and other credit card related particulars of candidates/ applicants. The integration

that is College/ Client/ University/ Institution specific is designed such that once the

candidates/ applicant completes the form and clicks “Submit" he/she is directed to the

payment gateway where payment is made. Sometimes if you click " Payment" link more

than once, it is possible your account will have a duplicate charge. Our Client Colleges

and/or Universities will reverse charges for any duplicate transaction. However, neither

greenclouds, its client colleges or universities, nor third party independent contractors will

be responsible for refunding any processing fees incurred by the incorrect use of this

feature. Accordingly, to avoid duplicate charges, please do not click the payment SUBMIT

button more than once.</p><h2 class=" text-h2" id="w500">Data Retention</h2><p style="float: left;" id="w429">Your personal information obtained through Formistry is retained for a maximum of five

consecutive application admissions cycles, depending on Client requirement. Your

personal information is removed or "archived," after two consecutive application

admissions cycles have lapsed, off the "live" servers and "backed-up" to a separate

secured remote server for storage (at least until overwritten when space is needed to

back-up more recent data) where no one can access it except on a very limited basis by

us or our trustworthy independent web service provider responsible for storage of your

personal information. Unless under court order, your application once archived remains

irretrievable. Therefore, you are strongly advised to print for your own records a hard copy

of all Formistry forms that you may have completed. We will retain personal data we process

on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client. GreenClouds will

retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes,

and enforce our agreements.</p><p style="float: left;" id="w503">Note that the reasons for granting us continued limited access to your personal information

from the remote server may include, but are not necessarily limited to, allowing us, our

trustworthy independent web service providers or other partners, or authorized Clients

Colleges/Universities to compile aggregate or historical information about applications

submitted in previous years. For statistical purposes, your personal information will be

used only in the aggregate meaning that personal identifying information such as your

name and aadhar/ passport number shall not be used. For some historical purposes,

however, we and our trustworthy independent web service providers or other partners,

including Client, Colleges, Universities and authorized Institutions will have continued

access to your archived personal identifying information as we and/or our trustworthy

independent web service providers or other partners deem necessary.</p><h2 class=" text-h2" id="w501">Security</h2><p style="float: left;" id="w502">The security of your personal information and our clients’ information is important to us.

When you enter sensitive information such as login credentials or payment details we

encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to

us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the

Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot

guarantee its absolute security. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal

information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to

us online, including any information that you send or receive as an email or text message

that is sent or received over your own email domain account, cell phone app or cell phone

service, and you do so at your own risk.</p><p style="float: left;" id="w504">Also, Formistry is not responsible and does not assume any liability for any texts, emails or

other communications that you receive from or send to any of our clients, and we cannot

accept liability for disclosure of any of your personal information due to errors in

transmission or unauthorized or illegal acts of third parties.</p><h2 class=" text-h2" id="w505">Greenclouds Identity Theft Policy</h2><p style="float: left;" id="w506">While rare, the risk of identity theft to on-line users of the Internet is on the rise and

GreenClouds recognizes the importance of taking steps to help its student applicants,

users, customers and members identify and detect patterns, practices or activities that

may indicate the existence of identity theft involving Formistry including implementing the

appropriate actions or responses to help safeguard against and/or mitigate the risk of

future or continued theft. Please read carefully the identity theft portions of this Privacy

Policy before using Formistry.</p><p style="float: left;" id="w507">The identity theft portions of this Privacy Policy are to help all Formistry users identify

identity theft involving Formistry website, application and services</p><p style="float: left;" id="w508">Please also note that the identity theft portions of this Policy also only address Formistry

identity theft policy concerning activities involving its own web site, service and our mobile

app and it does not apply to activities or identity theft policies of others or other web sites

such as web sites, apps or IT systems of Client Colleges or Universities or Institutions or

other third parties or any individuals or officials that may be associated with these other

institutions or third parties.</p><h2 class=" text-h2" id="w430">Patterns, Practices or Activities that May Indicate the Existence of Identity Theft</h2><p style="float: left;" id="w510">In order to be on-guard for possible identity theft, all candidates, applicants, users,

customers and members should be aware of the potential indicators of identity theft.

These may include but are not necessarily limited to the following:</p><ul class=" list-ul" id="w511"><li id="w512">Receiving an alert, notification or warning from a consumer reporting agency</li><li id="w513">Receiving notification of a address discrepancy</li><li id="w514">Receiving notification of an account being involuntarily closed</li><li id="w515">Receiving or becoming aware of suspicious documents, information or photos

held with Formistry</li></ul><h2 class=" text-h2" id="w509">Steps Formistry Takes to Detect Identity Theft</h2><p style="float: left;" id="w519">Formistry is used for students to apply for admissions/ opportunities with the Client

organisation that deploys Formistry or can be used directly by candidates to explore

possible Education and Employment opportunities. While Formistry through its trustworthy

web service providers deploys several security measures to protect the personal

identifying information of its users, such security measures may not always prevent the

crime of identity theft due to the specific nature of this crime. Accordingly, GreenClouds

must also rely upon the credible reporting of suspicious patterns, practices or activities of

identity theft from its trustworthy student applicants, users, customers, members or school

officials.</p><p style="float: left;" id="w520">In this connection, any student applicant, user, school official or member that becomes

aware of any suspicious pattern, practice or activity suggestive of an identity theft that also

involves or relates to Formistry is urged to notify the GreenClouds via email at

information about the suspected identity theft including information about how you may be

contacted.</p><h2 class=" text-h2" id="w522">Safeguard Against, Respond to and/or Mitigate Continued or Future Identity theft Or Breaches Of Personal Data</h2><p style="float: left;" id="w521">Upon receiving credible information about a possible identity theft or other possible related

wrongdoing involving or relating to the Formistry service, the Formistry website or mobile

app from a trustworthy student applicant, user, customer, school official or other

trustworthy third party, GreenClouds will do what it reasonably can to investigate the

merits of the claim by gathering up any other information within its reasonable control in

order to evaluate whether there has been a possible attempt to commit identity theft or

other possible related wrongdoing. If Formistry believes there are grounds for believing in

good faith that an attempt at wrongdoing was made, we reserve the right to cancel or

close an offending or possible tainted transaction or account, monitor a particular account

or line of communication, change applicable security codes, notify law enforcement

officials, notify the victim of the alleged attempted fraud or other wrongdoing, provide to

the victim certain information (including the personal identifying information of another

user) if reasonably requested or justified and/or do such other acts reasonable and/or

necessary to protect Formistry and/or victim of the alleged theft or other possible

wrongdoing and otherwise comply with any data breach notification or identity theft law

that is applicable to the particular circumstance. Formistry also reserves the right not to

take any action if no such action is warranted. Formistry reserves the right to rely upon its

trustworthy independent web service providers to help implement, safeguard against

and/or mitigate continued or future identity theft or other possible wrongdoing involving any

student applicant, user, customer, member or school official when the alleged theft or

other possible wrongdoing involves or is related to the Formistry service.</p><h2 class=" text-h2" id="w524">Referrals</h2><p style="float: left;" id="w526">If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about the website, service or app,
