              Protecting the privacy and safeguarding the personal and financial information of our clients and website visitors is one of our highest priorities. The following Privacy Statement explains how GAIN Capital Group collects and protects your information. References to "GAIN Capital Group" in this Privacy Statement include all GAIN Capital Group companies and divisions, including FOREX.com.<br><br>
              
              By opening a GAIN Capital Group account or by using GAIN Capital Group Web sites, you give your consent to the collection and use of personal information by GAIN Capital Group as explained in this privacy statement.<br><br>
              
              <span class="TextRegularBlueBold">Collection of personal information</span><br>
              We collect information required to open an account, to transact business effectively and to safeguard your assets or your privacy. To do this, we gather information to help us assess your needs and preferences.<br><br>
              
              The information we collect directly from you includes information required to communicate with you, including your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address; and, as required by law, to identify who you are, including Social Security or Passport/Tax ID number; address, etc.  We also collect demographic information when you open an account, including gender, birth date, education, occupation, etc. Our regulatory bodies also require us to assess your trading experience, your approximate annual income, approximate net worth, and available risk capital to assess your financial position.<br><br>
              
              You directly provide to us the majority of information we collect. You do this by completing the account application and related documentation, placing a trade, sending us an e-mail, or submitting information in response to a promotion or special offer. Other ways we obtain information are by (1) observing your usage of the Web site, and (2) providing products and services to you. This information enables us to offer you products and services that should be of interest to you.The information we collect indirectly from you includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, Internet Service Provider (ISP), time stamps, transactions placed, and banner ads you click. We do this through the use of cookies, which are small text files sent from the Web server to your computer. Cookies help us to know you better by providing operational data we can use to aid your interaction with our Web site and improve its navigation and usability.<br><br>
              
              <span class="TextRegularBlueBold">Usage of personal information</span><br>
              We use personal information only as appropriate to provide you quality service and security. For example, GAIN Capital Group may use the information collected from you to verify your identity and contact information. We may also use this information to establish and set up your trading account, issue an account number and a secure password, maintain your account activity, and contact you with account information. This information helps us improve our services to you, customize your browsing experience and inform you about additional products, services or promotions that may be of interest to you.<br><br>
              
              Should you close your account with us, GAIN Capital Group will retain your information, but only use it to comply with regulatory requirements and to periodically contact you to offer you the opportunity to reactivate your account or participate in other valuable offers.<br><br>
              
              <span class="TextRegularBlueBold">GAIN Capital Group affiliates and partners</span><br>

GAIN Capital Group also forges partnerships and alliances, which may include joint marketing agreements, with other companies who offer high-quality products and services that might be of value to our clients. In order to ensure that these products and services meet your needs and are delivered in a manner that is useful and relevant, GAIN Capital Group may share some information with partners, affiliates and alliances.
