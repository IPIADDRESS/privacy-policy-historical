<h3><strong>Other Information</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Other Information We Collect</strong></h4>
<p>âOther Informationâ is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser information</li>
<li>Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies</li>
<li>Demographic information and other information provided by you</li>
<li>Aggregated information that no longer reveals your specific identity</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How We Collect Other Information</strong></h4>
<p>We and our third party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Through your browser: Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system version and Internet browser type and version. We use this information to help ensure that our Site functions properly.</li>
<li>Using cookies and web beacons: Please see our <a href="https://www.verint.com/our-company/legal-documents/cookies-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cookie Policy</a>, which explains how we use cookies.</li>
<li>Usage data: We may use statistical data, analytics, trends and usage information derived from your use of services (âusage dataâ) through pixel tags and other similar technologies. Usage data includes, for example, aggregated quantitative information about active users, activity, topics, and groups. Some ways we use the usage data include operating, improving and personalizing the services and our offerings, as well as other Verint products and services.</li>
<li>IP Address: Your âIP Addressâ is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites. We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Site.</li>
<li>From you: Information such as your location, as well as other information, such as your preferred means of communication or areas of interest, is collected when you voluntarily provide this information. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site.</li>
<li>By aggregating information: Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site. (For example, we may use aggregated Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code.)</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How We Use and Disclose Other Information</strong></h4>
<p>Please note that we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then, in addition to the uses listed in the âHow We Collect Other Informationâ section above, we may use and disclose Other Information for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.</p>
<p>In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p>
<h4><strong>Third Party Advertising </strong></h4>
<p>Data Collected in Connection with Ad Serving and Targeting. Our goal at Verint is to provide you with ads that are relevant to you. We use the services of reputable third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, and site analytics, as well as to assist with the delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. We, our third-party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies and/or partners may also place web beacons for these third parties. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this privacy statement.</p>
<p>Often our ads are based on the content of pages you are viewing, but we also provide ads tailored to your interests. Our hope is that by presenting ads tailored to your interests, we will enhance your experience across Verintâs websites.</p>
<p>For example, if you often visit content on the Verint network about Workforce Optimization (WFO), we or our service providers may use âweb beaconsâ to infer your possible interest in WFO and may deliver an ad to you related to that interest when you are on the Site or on a third-party site. Itâs important to understand that these technologies use anonymous identifiers within the âcookiesâ stored in your browser. We offer you choices with regard to interest-based ads. To learn more about interest-based ads and the choices available to you, please visit our <a href="https://www.verint.com/our-company/legal-documents/ad-choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdChoices</a> page.</p>
<p>Verintâs Adherence to Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Verint adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance. To learn more about the Principles and your choices when it comes to the use of online behavioral advertising data by advertisers and ad servers across the Internet, visit http://optout.aboutads.info/#/ and <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/</a> .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
