						Forums.net does not solicit or knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 
						the age of 13. If Forums.net obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personally identifiable information 
						from a child under the age of 13, Forums.net will immediately delete such information from its database. 
						Because Forums.net does not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13,

					<ol>
						<li>

								Forums.net may automatically gather information of the sort that browsers automatically make available, 
								including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers accessing the Website; and

							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							Cookies
							<p>
								"Cookies" are text files that are placed on Your computer by websites that You visit or certain emails 
								that You open.  A Cookie acts as a string of information that a website stores on a user's computer, and

								purpose of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the Website. Forums.net uses Cookies.

								Forums.net uses cookies on the Website for the following purposes: to store a session identifier for You 
								so You do not have to re-enter Your username and password each time You visit the Website.  
							</p>
							<p>
								IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSERS TO REFUSE COOKIES 
								BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN OF THE SERVICES AND CERTAIN FEATURES OF
