					the age of 13. If Forums.net obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personally identifiable information 
					from a child under the age of 13, Forums.net will immediately delete such information from its database.

						<p>
							"Cookies" are text files that are placed on Your computer by websites that You visit or certain emails

							purpose of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the Website. Forums.net uses Cookies.
