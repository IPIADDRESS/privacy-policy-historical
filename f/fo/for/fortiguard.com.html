					This Privacy Policy applies to use of the AVFirewalls.com website 
					located at http://www.AVFirewalls.com (the "Site"). The Site 
					is the property of Virtual Graffiti, Inc.<p>Our website allows 
					you to buy products and services, apply for credit and receive 
					newsletters, e-mails or other promotional information from us. 
					We use the information that we collect about you to fulfill 
					your product and service purchases and to create a more personalized 
					online experience. This is just a brief overview, so please 
					read on for more details about our Privacy Policy. This Policy 
					may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.
					<u>Except as limited below, we reserve the right to use or disclose 
					your personally identifiable information for business reasons 
					in whatever manner desired.</u></p>
					<p>Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this 
					document only addresses the use and disclosure of information 
					we collect from you online. For some services, we either collect 
					and transfer personal information to a service provider you 
					have selected, or you may visit other merchants through links 
					on our site who may collect and use your personal information. 
					In those cases the third-party service provider or merchant's 
					privacy policy will govern how your information is handled.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><b>1. What information do we collect from you?</b></p>
						<p>In order to better provide you with numerous products 
						and services, Virtual Graffiti, Inc collects two types of 
						information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable 
						Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. 
						Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to 
						provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience 
						while using our site.</p>
						<p><i><b>Personally Identifiable Information:</b></i></p>
						<p>This refers to information that lets us know the specifics 
						of who you are. Personal information is requested when you 
						order a product or service. For example, this information 
						might include your name, billing address, shipping address, 
						telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other payment 
						information, and product details. With this information, 
						Virtual Graffiti, Inc can fill your orders and better provide 
						you with personalized services.</p>
						<p><i><b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</b></i></p>
						<p>This refers to information that does not by itself identify 
						a specific individual. We gather certain information about 
						you based upon where you shop on our site in several ways. 
						This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal 
						and an aggregated basis. For example, this information may 
						include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") 
						that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what 
						browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") 
						address. A URL is the global address of documents and other 
						resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier 
						for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet 
						Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. 
						Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information 
						based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, 
						an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned 
						to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing 
						web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers 
						require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on 
						the Internet, browse and shop.</p>
						<p>On an aggregated basis, we collect anonymous data related 
						to the pages, products, downloads and other content that 
						is sampled, clicked on, streamed, searched for, transferred 
						from and downloaded. Except as otherwise limited in this 
						Policy, we may disclose, sell, trade, or rent Non-Personally 
						Identifiable Information to others without your consent.</p>
						<p><b>2. Where do we collect information from you and how 
						do we use it?</b></p>
						<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is 
						to provide Virtual Graffiti, Inc’s visitors with a superior 
						customized online experience. We use the customer contact 
						information to fill orders, contact purchasers to inform 
						them of their order status, to send promotional information, 
						to enhance the operation of our site and administer our 
						systems.</p>
						<p>Demographic data also may be collected at our site from 
						third party advertising servers, content servers, or web 
						site analysis agents who provide us with the zip code and 
						area code associated with a visitor's server, along with 
						pages viewed on our site. We review the actions of the Virtual 
						Graffiti, Inc visitors on an aggregate basis to determine 
						customers' preferences. Virtual Graffiti, Inc also does 
						research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and pages 
						viewed based on the information provided to us during ordering, 
						a promotion, from our server log files, from our web site 
						analysis agents, or from contests, drawings or surveys. 
						We will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience 
						at our site, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, 
						to statistically analyze site use, to improve our product 
						offerings, and to customize our site's content, layout, 
						and services. We receive reports from third party ad servers, 
						content servers, or web site analysis agents that tells 
						us how many ads were presented and clicked upon or what 
						content was served or viewed. </p>
						<p><i><b>Ordering:</b></i></p>
						<p>When you order from us, we collect personally identifiable 
						information from you. If you order one of our products or 
						services, we will collect and maintain your name, e-mail 
						address, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, 
						product selections, credit card or other payment information, 
						order number, referring URL, IP address, page you bought 
						from and a password. We collect this, and other information, 
						as disclosed in this Policy, in order to fill your order, 
						to communicate with you about your order and to send you 
						promotional materials. Before confirming your order, you 
						will have the opportunity to review the product order form 
						and make changes and additions to the information it contained 
						and these changes will be automatically kept for future 
						use. We may require additional verifications or information 
						before accepting any order.</p>
						<p><i><b>Newsletters, Promotional E-mails and Personalized 
						On-line Ads:</b></i></p>
						<p>We offer free newsletters, promotional e-mails and personalized 
						on-line advertisements as a service to our customers. We 
						will send you newsletters and e-mails periodically listing 
						current specials and deals. You may "opt-out," or unsubscribe 
						from our newsletters, emails or personalized on-line advertisements 
						by following any unsubscribe instructions in any e-mail, 
						newsletter or personalized on-line advertisement you receive 
						from us. After doing so, if you have opted out of receiving 
						all newsletters, all promotional emails or all personalized 
						on-line ads, you will not receive future promotional emails, 
						newsletters or personalized on-line advertisements (as applicable), 
						unless you open a new account, enter a contest, or otherwise 
						subsequently sign up to receive newsletters, emails or personalized 
						on-line advertisements.</p>
						<p><b>3. With whom do we share your information?</b></p>
						<p><i><b>Fulfillment:</b></i></p>
						<p>The information collected by Virtual Graffiti, Inc is 
						used for processing orders, keeping you informed about your 
						order status, for statistical purposes, for improving our 
						site and its performance, to serve ads, and to notify you 
						of products or special offers that may be of interest to 
						you.</p>
						<p><i><b>Other Parties Generally:</b></i></p>
						<p>We may provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information 
						about our customers' sales, traffic patterns, and related 
						site information to third parties, but these statistics 
						do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
						<p><i><b>Products Advertised on Our Site:</b></i></p>
						<p>Where you order or sign up for goods or services offered 
						through our site, but sold directly to you by a third party 
						or fulfilled by a third party, we give your personal information 
						to that third party to facilitate the sale of such goods 
						or services (e.g., orders shipped from distribution or direct 
						from the manufacturer).</p>
						<p><b>4. What security precautions are in place to protect 
						against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?</b></p>
						<p>In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions 
						and order fulfillment are handled by established third party 
						banking, processing agents and distribution institutions. 
						They receive the information needed to verify and authorize 
						your credit card or other payment information and to process 
						and ship your order. </p>
						<p>Within Virtual Graffiti, Inc, your information is kept 
						on password protected, limited access servers. Wherever 
						possible and applicable, Virtual Graffiti, Inc servers reside 
						behind a corporate firewall that maintains controls on access 
						to the system from both our internal network and the Internet.</p>
						<p><b>5. Contacting Virtual Graffiti, Inc about privacy 
						questions or concerns</b></p>
						<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, 
						the practices of this site, or your dealings with this site, 
						please contact Virtual Graffiti, Inc by sending a letter 
						to: </p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>Attn: Privacy Policy<br>
							Virtual Graffiti, Inc<br>
							9979 Muirlands Blvd.<br>
							Irvine, California, 92618</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p><b>6. Privacy Policy changes</b></p>
						<p>This Privacy Policy was last changed on August 6, 2008. 
						If Virtual Graffiti, Inc makes changes to any terms or conditions 
						of the Privacy Policy, the changes will be posted in this 
						document so that you will always know what information we 
						gather, how we might use that information and to whom we 
						will disclose it. We may change, modify, add or remove portions 
						of this Policy at any time, and any changes will become 
						effective immediately upon being posted unless we tell you 
						otherwise.</p>
