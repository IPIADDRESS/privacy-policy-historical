		<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At <strong>Forex Root</strong> our most important  asset is our relationship  with you.  &nbsp;Therefore,  we are committed to safeguarding the privacy of  the  personally identifiable  information we collect from you via this   website (the “Site”).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your information is yours and we  respect that. &nbsp;This policy outlines  the  types of information <strong>Forex Root </strong>collects about you and how that  information is  used. &nbsp;The policy applies to all current  and former  members of <strong>Forex Root</strong>.&nbsp; This  policy may be revised from time to time, so  please revisit this page often to  remain fully informed of our  policies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We take precautions to ensure the information  we collect about you   is protected and is accessed only by authorized  individuals and   organizations.&nbsp;  Specifically, we follow generally accepted industry   standards to protect  the personally identifiable information submitted   to us, both during  transmission and once we receive it.&nbsp; No  method of   transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is    100% secure, however.&nbsp; Therefore, while  we strive to use commercially   acceptable means to protect your personally  identifiable information,   we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because we know how important security and  privacy is to you, <strong>Forex Root </strong>operates under the following principles when  handling your  personal information:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We allow you to create a screen name that is not your real  name,  providing you control of identifying information within the <strong>Forex Root </strong>community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can de-activate your account for any reason at any time  and we   will delete all of your personally identifiable information from our    servers. We will not keep a copy of your personally identifiable   information  for any purposes upon account deactivation except as may be   required by law or  to otherwise protect legal rights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We use secure server software (SSL) and firewalls to  protect your   information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or    destruction. Further, our employees and third party service providers   have  access to your nonpublic personal information only on a "need to    know" basis. Finally, we internally audit our business practices and    procedures, examining confidentiality standards and information access   in order  to protect your personal information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What Information We Collect</strong> </span><br><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you browse the non-password  protected portions of our Site, you   do so anonymously; no personally identifiable  information is   collected.&nbsp; When you sign  up to become a registered user of <strong>Forex Root </strong>we request that you provide to us  your name, address and email address.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may also choose to supply trading  information (e.g., how long   you have been trading, your preferred trading  hours, etc.) and a   profile description. Once you register with <strong>Forex Root </strong>and  sign  in to  our Site, you are not anonymous to us. We may use the  Registration   Information to open an account with us, to provide  services that may be  useful  to you and to contact you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Site also permits you to  contact us via email and our Contact Us   form.&nbsp;  Whenever you send an email via our Site or through the Contact   Us form,  you will be providing us with your name, email address and  any  information you  choose to include in the text of your message.&nbsp;   For  example, you may choose to provide your mailing address or other    information necessary or helpful for us to address your query or   concern.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, as a registered user  of our Site, we collect and   maintain information about your membership activity.  &nbsp;This activity   includes your trading  ideas, executed transactions, positions, history,   comments, subscriptions to  other members as well as ratings of other   members’ trading ideas and comments  and their ratings of you. &nbsp;We   publish  this information and derivatives based on this information on   our Site and we  use this information to provide the services you have   requested.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Additional Personal Information You Provide, or Direct Us to Collect  from Others, to Use our Service</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also collect personal information  from you in two other general ways:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Personal information you directly provide or  input as you use the <strong>Forex Root </strong>Site; and</li>
<li>Personal information we gather with your  permission from third   party websites and Internet services that you register on  our Site.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, once you are a  registered user of our Site, you may   register your brokerage account through our  Site by providing the user   ID, password and other information necessary to  access such account   (“Verification  Information”). &nbsp;We will collect the  transactional   information regarding your brokerage account to display it to you  on   the Site. This information may include your current holdings, and your   past  and future transactions, to name a few. <br> <strong>Forex Root </strong>limits  its  use of your  personal investment information to the purposes for  which  it has been collected  and as we describe in this Privacy Policy.  Except  as necessary to carry out  your requests, <strong>Forex Root </strong>uses this  information only on an aggregate,  non-personal basis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Technical and Other Information</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you visit our platform, we may  collect information through   “cookies” or other similar Web tools to enhance the  user experience.   &nbsp;Cookies are small  strings of text that are sent by our Site to your   browser on your computer’s  hard drive.&nbsp; Cookies enable us to  recognize   you when you return to our Site, to maintain your Web session while    you browse throughout the Site, as well as help us provide you with a   better,  more personalized experience. Our cookies are not tied to   personally  identifiable information.&nbsp; Most web  browsers automatically   accept cookies, but it is possible to change your  browser setup so  that  it does not accept cookies.&nbsp; However, rejecting cookies may  prevent you   from taking advantage of certain portions of our Site.<br> In  addition, when you are browsing  our Site, <strong>Forex Root </strong>automatically  receives and records information on our  server logs from your browser  including your IP address, <strong>Forex Root </strong>cookie   information and the pages  you request. &nbsp;We  use this information to  improve the functionality and  usability of our  services. &nbsp;Our log  files are not tied to  personally  identifiable information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How We Use the Information We Collect</strong> </span><br><strong>Communications  from the Site</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will send you strictly  service-related announcements on rare   occasions when it is necessary to do so. &nbsp;For instance, if our Site is   temporarily  suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.&nbsp;   Generally, you may not opt-out of these  communications, which are not   promotional in nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Customer  Service</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based upon the personally identifiable  information you provide us   during the registration process, we will send you a  welcoming email to   verify your username and password. &nbsp;We will also communicate with you  in  response  to your inquiries, to provide the services you request,  and  to manage your  account. &nbsp;We will communicate with you by  email or   telephone, in accordance with your wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Verification Information</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a registered user of our Site,  you provide to us your   Verification Information to access your trading records  from your   Broker. &nbsp;Verification Information  is only used to verify the activity   information and is not accessible anywhere  on our Site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong> <strong>We Do Not Reveal Any Personally  Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will not publish any personally  identifiable information (e.g.   name, email address or contact information) on  our platform or Site for   others to view, without your permission, unless you  choose to post it   yourself on the Site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>We Do Not Reveal Any Verification  Information</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Social Networking FAQ</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Social Networking in General and the </strong><strong>Forex Root </strong><strong>Trader Social Network</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Social networks are on-line groups, networks or communities of people   who share some common element(s) such as a particular interest, and  are  interested in exploring and discussing such interests with others  on  the internet. Social networking involves the on-line interaction of  its  members via multiple and various electronic formats, such as chat,   messaging, email, video, voice chat, file sharing, blogging, discussion   groups and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A social network provides its members with many features, such as the   ability to create and view profiles of other members who share   commonalities. A social network also allows members to create personal   profiles, potentially with fairly detailed information, as well as allow   its members to engage in activities such as create personal blogs,   share personal information and other applications that allow its members   to help them to connect with other network members.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Forex Root </strong>Trader Social Network is limited to individuals  who are  active forex traders, as described in the Terms of Use   http://www.forexroot.com/terms-of-use.  As with other social networks,   members of the <strong>Forex Root </strong>Trader Social Network may create  personal  profiles, in this case with respect to their forex trading,  and may  share among other information, information on their forex  trading  activities and performance and their market views and trading   strategies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Benefits to Social Networks</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A social network provides opportunities for its members to engage   with other members and share information over the Internet and find   other members on-line with similar interests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Risks to Social Networks</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Social networks are not without their risks, which are no different   than any other on-line activity. With public spaces, or even within a   closed social network community, the services can be used by anyone.   There are risks as one does not truly know who the other members of the   social network are. In addition, while <strong>Forex Root </strong>does its best to   restrict access to your information, <strong>Forex Root </strong>has no control over what   third parties with access to your information may do with it. For   example, you may post certain personal information, but another member   copies and publishes it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When using social networks, you should take caution when posting your   personal information as well as carefully consider the information you   get from the social network. You should take care in trusting the   information posted in a social network as it may be difficult to prevent   members or the public at large from posting false or misleading   information, including information in their personal profiles.  Although <strong>Forex Root </strong>takes reasonable steps to regularly monitor the content of   its site to identify and remove any misleading or otherwise fraudulent   posts, and may ban a member for egregious or repeat violations, there is   no assurance that we will detect all misleading or fraudulent posts,   and members should not rely upon or assume the accuracy of information   posted by other members and should make their own independent trading   decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, be careful with personal information. Once you have   posted your personal information to the internet, you have lost control   over who will see it and how it will be used. Information you post or  as  contained in your profile can easily be copied and shared with   thousands of others at the press of a button. In addition, when posting   other materials, such as photos, you should take precaution as such   information or pictures can be altered or distorted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is the potential for risk in using the <strong>Forex Root </strong>Trader Social   Network stemming from the illegal or improper use of the social network   by third parties who might, for example, post misleading information  in  an attempt to improperly influence trading decisions or find ways to   copy and aggregate member profiles, collect personal financial   information or copy personal content and use it for their own purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beware of files posted or clicking on executable files on social   networks as social network sites provide an ideal and cost-efficient   platform for the distribution of viruses, worms and bots, Trojans,   spyware and more. Companies with a presence on these sites could be   adversely affected.</p>
