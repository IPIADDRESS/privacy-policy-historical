<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="policy2"></a>2. What is personal information?<br>
2.1 In this Privacy Policy, “personal information” has the meaning set out in the Privacy Act. Essentially, personal information is information or an opinion about an individual who is reasonably identifiable.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#articleTop" title="Back to Top" style="text-decoration: none;" class=" cta-button cta-button-primary " _link_style="cta-button cta-button-primary">Back to Top</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="policy3"></a>3. What types of personal information does Ford collect?<br>
3.1 The types of personal information Ford collects from you depend on the circumstances in which the information is collected.<br>
<br>
3.2 Ford may collect contact details including your name, address, email address and phone and fax numbers.<br>
<br>
3.3 Where relevant, Ford may also collect your driver’s licence and registration details, date of birth or age group, occupation, gender, information about your vehicle (including its number plate and vehicle identification number), answers you provide to questions we ask and other information in relation to your dealings with Ford or Dealers (such as types of vehicle purchased and replaced and repair/service history).<br>
<br>

A reference to an individual contractor in this document includes those individuals who perform work for Ford under a “purchased service” arrangement. If you are employed by or contracted to a Dealer, we may also collect and maintain training records about you.<br>

3.5 When using the Ford website, we or our third party service providers may collect web site usage information such as the IP address you are using, the name of your Internet service provider, your browser version, the web site that referred you to us and the next website you go to, the pages you request, the date and time of those requests and the country you are in. Except where you provide it to us via the website, we do not collect personal information such as your name, mailing address, email address or phone number when you are browsing our website.<br>
<br>
3.6 Ford does not generally require customers to disclose any sensitive information (e.g. details of race, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, health information etc.) to us. In limited circumstances, we may require prospective employees, individual contractors and Dealer personnel to provide us with certain health information. See section 10 of this Privacy Policy for further details.<br>
<br>

<br>
3.8 Occasionally, sensitive information in relation to an individual’s membership of a trade or similar association may be provided to us but we do not actively seek this information. We will only use and disclose that information for the purpose for which you disclosed it to us and as permitted by the Privacy Act and other relevant laws.<br>
<br>
3.9 In addition to the types of personal information identified above, Ford may collect personal information as otherwise permitted or required by law.</p>

<br>

<br>

<p><a name="policy8"></a>8. Does personal information leave Australia?<br>
8.1 Some of the third parties to whom we disclose personal information may be located outside Australia. For example, we may disclose personal information to our related companies overseas and to our overseas service providers.<br>
<br>
8.2 The countries in which these third parties are located will depend on the circumstances. In the ordinary course of business we commonly disclose personal information to parties located in the United States, India, China and Singapore (where our Ford group data and business centres are located). Except where an exception applies under the Privacy Act, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that such overseas recipients do not breach the Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act in relation to such information.</p>

However, except to the extent liability cannot be excluded due to the operation of statute, we exclude all liability (including in negligence) for the consequences of any unauthorised access to, disclosure of, misuse of or loss or corruption of your personal information. Nothing in this Privacy Policy restricts, excludes or modifies or purports to restrict, exclude or modify any statutory consumer rights under any applicable law including the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth). Please notify us immediately if you become aware of any breach of security.<br>
<br>

<br>
10.3 If you refuse to provide any of the information requested by Ford, or to consent to Ford disclosing your questionnaire to its service providers for the purpose of a medical assessment or to the disclosure of the results of your medical assessment to Ford, we may be unable to consider your application (or if you have been successful in being employed by Ford, we may not be able to consider you for particular roles or positions within Ford).<br>
