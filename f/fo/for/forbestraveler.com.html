<div class="headline">FORBESTRAVELER.COM PRIVACY STATEMENT</div>
<br>
ForbesTraveler.com is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read
the following statement to understand how your personal information will be
treated as you make full use of the ForbesTraveler.com website. The
ForbesTraveler.com website is owned and operated by Forbes.com LLC. <br>
<br>
If you have any questions regarding our privacy statement, please feel free to
contact us by e-mail at privacy@forbes.net. <br>
<br>
<b>Summary</b> <br>
Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your experience on
our website. We use aggregated (gathered up data across all user accounts)
information to develop content targeted to users' interests and to better the
website user experience. ForbesTraveler.com is committed to your privacy and
other than as provided herein or after receiving your specific consent,
ForbesTraveler.com will not share any personal information with any third party
at any time, unless required by law. <br>
<br>
What this Privacy Policy Covers <br>
This privacy policy covers the website ForbesTraveler.com. Other Forbes.com LLC.
sites linked to from this website, including Forbes.com, have their own privacy
statements which can be viewed on those sites. <br>
<br>
Please be aware that ForbesTraveler.com sponsors, advertisers, co-branded
websites or websites that have links on our site may collect personally
identifiable information about you on their websites. The information practices
of those parties are not covered by this privacy statement. ForbesTraveler.com
users should also be aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal
information in chat areas or bulletin boards, that information may be collected
by others and may result in unsolicited messages from others. <br>
<br>
<b>Gathering of Information</b> <br>
<br>
<b>Voluntary Submission</b> <br>
ForbesTraveler.com does not collect personally identifying information about any
individual ForbesTraveler.com website user except when knowingly provided by
such individual. For example, we may ask you for information, such as your email
address, ZIP code and the country in which you are viewing the website when you
register to become a member of ForbesTraveler.com. You may also provide
information to ForbesTraveler.com in other contexts, for example, to enter a
contest or complete a survey. In the event you order something from
ForbesTraveler.com or one of our sponsors, we may request additional personal
information, such as your address, telephone number and credit card information,
in order to complete the purchase. You always have the option not to provide the
information we request. If you choose not to provide the information we request,
you can still visit most of the ForbesTraveler.com website, but you may be
unable to access certain options and services. When you register or become a
member of Forbes.com or provide information to Forbes.com in any other manner,
you agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information. <br>
<br>
<b>Cookies</b> <br>
A cookie is a data file that certain websites write to your computer's hard
drive when you visit such sites. A cookie file can contain information, such as
a user identification code, that the site uses to track the pages you have
visited. ForbesTraveler.com uses cookies to track user traffic patterns
throughout the ForbesTraveler.com website and to remember your passwords and
video plug-in preferences so that you don't have to reset them each time you
visit the website. We use this data on an anonymous basis and we do not
correlate this information with personal data of any user. Business partners of
ForbesTraveler.com and vendors providing hosting and other services for
ForbesTraveler.com., as well as advertisers who contract directly with a
third-party service to serve their advertisements, may set their own cookies
which may collect similar anonymous information. <br>
<br>
Most website browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change
your browser settings to display a warning before accepting a cookie, or to
refuse all cookies. However, if you choose to disable the receipt of cookies
from our website, you may not be able to use certain features of the site. <br>
<br>
<b>Browser Level Information <br>
</b>ForbesTraveler.com web servers automatically collect information about a
site user's IP address, browser type and the URL that you just came from
(whether this URL is on the website or not) and which URL you next go to
(whether this URL is on the website or not) by reading this information from the
user's browser (information provided by every user's browser). This information
is collected in a database and used--in an aggregated, anonymous manner--in our
internal analysis of traffic patterns within our website. This information is
automatically logged by most websites. ForbesTraveler.com also uses a third
party to collect information, including through the use of web beacons. <br>
<br>
<b>Use of Information <br>
</b>Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your
experience on our website. <br>
<br>
<b>To Target Content <br>
</b>To develop content targeted to your interests, we use aggregated user
information to determine which areas of our website users prefer based upon
traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but instead
how well each page or content area performs overall. <br>
&nbsp;<p></p>
<p><b>To Provide Interactive Communications From ForbesTraveler.com</b><br>
To enhance your experience we may provide you with interactive communications,
such as our electronic newsletters, to the e-mail address that you provide to
us. Such interactive communications are provided only to those users who have
expressly provided us with their permission to receive them as part of their
user profile.</p>
<p><br>
From time to time we may provide e-mails highlighting new features, promotions
or contests on the website to those users who have expressly provided us with
their permission to send such communications as part of their user profile. </p>
<p><br>
<b>To Provide Communications From Third Parties</b><br>
We respect the privacy of our users and shall not disclose or distribute our
user list to any third party, nor shall it permit anyone else to do so. However,
we do make available for rental our list of those registrants who have expressly
provided us with their permission to receive third party information and offers
as part of their user profile. In those cases, your personal information is not
transferred to the third party.<br>
Control of Your Information</p>
<p><br>
Users may change their user profile to stop receiving newsletters or marketing
material from ForbesTraveler.com or on behalf of external third party business
partners. Users may choose to stop receiving such communications at any time by
visiting the "edit my profile" page at http://www.forbes.com/membership/editprofile.jhtml,
or by following instructions at the end of any e-mail.<br>
<br>
<b>Sharing of Information <br>
</b>When you are on an area of ForbesTraveler.com and are asked for personal
information, you are sharing that information with ForbesTraveler.com as well as
business partners and vendors providing hosting and other services for
ForbesTraveler.com. If you do not want your information to be shared, you can
choose not to allow the transfer of your information by not using that
particular service. In addition, any personally identifiable information
provided by our users as part of an advertiser promotion online may be provided
directly to advertisers. <br>
In the event you purchase goods or services from ForbesTraveler.com, a partner,
or advertiser, and you provide personal information to ForbesTraveler.com
incident to such purchase, ForbesTraveler.com will provide this information: a)
to the third party vendor(s) to the extent necessary to fulfill your order, and
b) to a third party shipping service or common carrier as necessary to deliver
your order to you.<br>
<br>
<b>Aggregate, Anonymous Information With Advertisers</b> <br>
ForbesTraveler.com derives the majority of its revenue from advertising and
sharing information is essential to keeping our services affordable to users. In
order to attract and retain advertisers we use the aggregated, anonymous
information that we gather (as well as information from third-party market
researchers) to describe our services to partners and to assist our advertisers
and sponsors to better understand our audience. We do not disclose personally
identifying information about our users to these parties. <br>
<br>
<b>As Necessary to Provide Services to You <br>
</b>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our
behalf, such as performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only
provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the
service. These companies are subject to agreements that require them to maintain
the confidentiality of your information and they are prohibited from using that
information for any other purpose. <br>
<br>
<b>In The Event of Sale or Bankruptcy<br>
</b>The ownership of ForbesTraveler.com may change at some point in the future.
Should that occur, we want this site to be able to maintain a relationship with
you. In the event of a sale, merger, public offering, bankruptcy or other change
in control of Forbes.com LLC and/or ForbesTraveler.com your information may be
shared with the person or business that owns or controls this site. Opting out
of receiving information from third parties will not affect our right to
transfer your information to a new owner, but your choices will continue to be
respected regarding the use of your information. <br>
As Required By Law <br>
ForbesTraveler.com may disclose your personal information if required to do so
by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to
the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on ForbesTraveler.com
or to protect and defend the rights or property of ForbesTraveler.com. <br>
<br>
<b>Security</b> <br>
Your information is stored on ForbesTraveler.com's servers located in the United
States. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal
information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure
to protect your privacy, including encryption, "firewalls" and Secure Socket
Layers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and
unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect
such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company.
However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. <br>
<br>
<b>Privacy of Children <br>
</b>Kids under 13: Do not send any information about yourself to us--including
information such as your name, address, or email address. We do not knowingly
collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the event
that we learn we have collected any personal information from a child under the
age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that
information from our database as quickly as possible. <br>
<br>
<b>How to Contact Us <br>
</b>If you have any questions regarding our privacy statement, please feel free
to contact us by email at privacy@forbes.net. We read every message submitted
and try to reply promptly to every one. <br>
<br>
<b>How Will I Know if the Privacy Policy Is Changed? <br>
</b>This statement may change from time to time, so please check back
periodically. If we are going to be using the information collected from users
in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, we
will send affected users written notice of the change by e-mail. <br>
