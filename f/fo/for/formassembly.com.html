				   input data into the form as requested by the Subscriber.

				   use and safeguard the personal information you  provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our
				   site and our products and services. This statement will be assessed from time  to time against new technologies,
				   business practices and our Subscribers and their Users' needs.</p>

				  <h2 id="item2">What  Information Do We Collect?</h2>

				  <p>In addition to providing the foregoing  information to our Subscribers, if you choose to correspond further through  e-mail, we may retain the content of your e-mail messages together with your  e-mail address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these  electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information  received by mail and telephone.</p>

				  <h3>2. Web  Site Use Information</h3>

				   </p>
