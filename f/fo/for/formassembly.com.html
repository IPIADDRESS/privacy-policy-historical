</p>


				  <h3 id="useinfo">2. Web  Site Use Information</h3>

				 <hr size="1"><br>

				  <h2 id="item6">How Can Your Information be Secured?</h2>
				  <p>We provide the capability for your data to be encrypted.  However, the creator of the form in which you input data chooses how and whether to encrypt your information.  Before inputting any sensitive information, determine if encryption is enabled by looking for the "lock" symbol on your web browser or a yellow highlight in the web browser address bar.
</p>
				  <p>INFORMATION OR E-MAIL THAT YOU SEND TO US MAY NOT BE SECURE UNLESS WE ADVISE YOU THAT SECURITY MEASURES WILL BE IN PLACE PRIOR TO YOUR TRANSMITTING THE INFORMATION. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as a social security number to us through an unsecured e-mail.
</p>

				 <hr size="1"><br>

				  <h2 id="security">Information Security</h2>
				  <p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
</p>
<p>
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at contact@formassembly.com. We do not, however, secure your personal information that is in the possession or control of our Subscriber.

</p>

				 <hr size="1"><br>

				  <h2 id="disclosure">What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</h2>
				  <p>We may disclose your personal information:</p>
				  <ul style="list-style-type: square; padding-left:30px;">
				  <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process,</li>
				  <li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,</li>
				  <li>if Veer West LLC is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets,  you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information,</li>
				  <li>to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.</li>
				  </ul>
<p></p>

				 <hr size="1"><br>

				  <h2 id="links">What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site? </h2>
