					  <h3>Information We Collect and How It's Used</h3>
                      <h4>Information You Explicitly Provide</h4>
                      <h4>via Order Form:</h4>
                      <p>To process your order, we require your name, billing address, 
                        phone number, e-mail address, shipping address and credit 
                        card information. We use this information solely to process 
                        your order and, if any questions should arise, to contact 
                        you about your order. In general, we will try to contact 
                        you first by e-mail and only if that fails, or if time 
                        is critical, will we try to contact you by phone. We process 
                        your orders ourselves, in house, and thus the sharing 
                        of this information is usually non-existent with any third 
                        parties. However, when we have to share this information, 
                        it will only be that information which is absolutely necessary, 
                        with those third parties that may be involved in the processing 
                        of your order in the future. For example, the financial 
                        institution that issued your credit card and the shipping 
                        carrier that delivers your order. Any sharing of personal 
                        information will be only with service providers (such 
                        as banks, credit card verifiers, etc.) in processing orders. 
                        When making a payment via the Paypal option be aware that 
                        you will be entering your personal and financial information 
                        on the Paypal website even though the Forzieri logo frames 
                        the top of the page. This for ease of navigation back 
                        to the Forzieri site. For information provided on the 
                        Paypal web site please refer to Paypal’s Privacy 
                        Policy. None of the information provided by the user to 
                        Paypal is shared back to the Forzieri site as all necessary 
                        information to process the order are already provided 
                        by the user to Forzieri before the payment. Paypal simply 
                        communicates to Forzieri the approval or not to accept 
                        the purchase.</p>
                      <h4>via "Contact Us" E-mails</h4>
                      <p>Should you decide to contact us through one of our e-mail 
                        addresses for a suggestion or problem via the Contact 
                        US form, you will be supplying your name and e-mail address 
                        and we will only use that information to send you a prompt 
                        reply.<br>Service related or confirmation emails disclosure: 
						because these emails are related to the service and are not promotional in nature, 
						generally there is not opt-out or unsubscribe provided. 
						Example is sending user name and password when a user registers for the first time.</p>

                        just contact LinkShare directly at <a href="http://www.linkshare.com" target="_blank">www.linkshare.com</a>.</p>
                      <h4>via Wish List set-up</h4>
                      <p>By creating a Wish List on the Forzieri Site you are required 
                        to provide your name and e-mail address. We use this information 
                        solely to make the wish list accessible to your person. 
                        Optionally, in case you wish to make your Wish List searchable 
                        by others, you can choose to provide some unique facts 
                        about your person, date of birth (please note that only 
                        month and day are asked for, not year of birth) and gift 
                        giving event type so to make it easier for your friends 
                        to recognize your list in our public list database. Also, 
                        optionally, you can provide your shipping address so that 
                        friends can buy direct from your Wish List and have items 
                        shipped direct to you. To protect your privacy, when choosing 
                        to make your list searchable, Forzieri DOES NOT display 
                        your full shipping address (only City and State) or e-mail 
                        address. We will not use Wish List data for additional 
                        mailings or marketing purposes. Shipping address only, 
                        in case provided, will be used to process orders -- see 
                        the "via Order Form" paragraph above.</p>
                      <h4>via Catalog Requests form</h4>
                      <p>When requesting a catalog via our web form, you are required 
                        to provide your full name , shipping address and phone 
                        number. This information will not be shared or sold to 
                        third parties and you will not receive additional mailings

                      <h4>via Live Chat (LivePerson)</h4>
                      <p>If you have questions about the Forzieri products, you 
                        have the option to use our "live chat" support 
                        service. This service asks you for a user name (you can 
                        use your real name or you can use an alias). Your individual 
                        chat session runs on a program by LivePerson. The chat 
                        transcript is saved in a secure location along with your 
                        IP address. This not only protects our customer care representatives 
                        against inappropriate chat content on the part of unscrupulous 
                        users, but it also allows us to pull up your previous 
                        chat session if you come back later and chat again. The 
                        LivePerson feature makes use of cookies on our website 
                        to facilitate one on one dialogue and to provide us insight 
                        into how our users navigate our website. However, we have 
                        no access to or control over these cookies, once we have 
                        given permission for them to set cookies.</p>
                      <h4>via Tell-A-Friend</h4>
                      <p>Forzieri discloses that when using the Tell-A-Friend service 
                        the user will be asked for the friends’ name and 
                        email addresses. These information are used exclusively 
                        for a one time invitation email and are not stored for 
                        future use.</p>
                      
                      <h3>Information We Automatically Collect</h3>
                      <h4>Shopper ID</h4>
                      <p>Upon visiting our site, we assign you a unique Shopper 
                        ID and attempt to store that onto your computer in the 
                        form of a cookie. This is used to keep track of your shopping 
                        basket during your visit and between visits. Cookies used 
                        by Forzieri.com are not tied to personally identifiable 
                        information. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of 
                        being assigned a Shopper ID, we recommend disabling cookie 
                        support in your browser (please see your browser documentation 
                        for specific procedures). You may still place an order 
                        by phone, fax or postal mail. Disabling cookie support 
                        will disable the shopping basket feature of our site.</p>
                      <h4>IP Address</h4>
                      <p>We record IP addresses in the aggregate for monitoring 
                        the level of activity on our site, but we do not link 
                        this to your Shopper ID.</p>
                      <h4>Affiliate ID</h4>
                      <p>If you entered our site by clicking a link on one of our 
                        affiliate web sites, we will attempt to store the ID of 
                        the affiliate as a cookie. We do this to ensure the affiliate 
                        receives proper credit for any subsequent order you might 
                        place. Your personally identifiable information will not 
                        be shared with any affiliates.</p>

					  <h3>Security</h3>
                      <p>We utilize industry standard SSL encryption when accepting your credit 
                        card information during our online checkout process. In 
                        addition, we utilize the same encryption standard when 
                        transferring your credit card data to our internal fulfillment 
                        system. To further enhance our security measures, our 
                        fulfillment system is not accessible via the Internet 
                        and we delete from our web site database all credit card 
                        information within 24 hours of receipt.</p>

					  <h3>Links</h3>
                      <p>We may include links to other sites and if you decide to follow 
                        those links, although we choose a site to which we may 
                        link very carefully based on their integrity and quality, 
                        we can't be responsible for the privacy policies and content 
                        of those sites. Generally, we will let you know when a 
                        link goes to another site.</p>

                        in a manner different from that stated at the time of

                        material changes in our privacy practices that do not 
                        affect user information already stored in our database, 
                        we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying 
                        users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice 
                        we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications

					  <h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>
					  <p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, 
                        we may need to disclose personal information when required 
                        by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action 
                        is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, 
                        a court order or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
                        
                      <a name="glossary"></a>
					  <h3>Glossary of Terms</h3>
                      <h4>Cookies</h4>
                      <p>Cookies (we're not sure how they got this gastronomic 
                        name) are pieces of information that a web site stores 
                        in your computer. Temporary cookies only last as long 
                        as your browser is running. Persistent cookies are stored 
                        on your hard disk (they take up very little space). Sites 
                        often use cookies to identify repeat visitors and offer 
                        them personalized service.</p>
						
                      <h4>IP Address</h4>
                      <p>When you are connected to the Internet, your computer 
                        has a unique Internet ID called an IP address. Most people 
                        that connect through a dial-up service, such as America 
                        Online, get a different IP address each time they login. 
                        Others might have a permanently assigned IP address, called 
                        a static IP address. It is difficult or impossible for 
                        a web site to collect personal information about you (i.e., 
                        your name, e-mail address, etc.) from your IP address 
                        alone, though a static IP address makes this easier.</p>
                      
					  <h4>Shopper ID</h4>
                      <p>A unique ID assigned to each shopper that visits an online 
                        store with a shopping basket system. Each store you visit 
                        will assign you a different ID. Many stores use a cookie 
                        to save your Shopper ID for re-use when you return to 
                        that same store. Some shoppers find this convenient and 
                        others find it objectionable.</p>
						
                      <h4>SSL Encryption</h4>
                      <p>A method by which information transmitted across the Internet 
                        is scrambled to the point where it's virtually indecipherable 
                        by anyone who should intercept the data before it reaches 
                        its destination. Most reputable online stores make use 
                        of SSL encryption to request credit card information and 
                        other sensitive data from their customers. Web pages where 
                        SSL encryption is activated are typically identified by 
                        a lock or key symbol displayed somewhere in your browser. 
                        Refer to your browser's documentation for the specific 
                        symbol and location.</p>
