<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p><i><b>FOREX</b>YARD</i> truly values each and every one of our visitors right to privacy and we take your privacy seriously. We value our relationship with you, and we take pride in maintaining loyalty and respect with each individual client by providing you with security. As part of our normal operations we may collect information about you and how you interact with our website. Our Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with a full description of the information we collect about you and what we do with that information. The provisions of this notice apply to former customers as well as our current customers. </p>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>In general, you can visit FOREXYARD.COM without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we might request that you disclose certain pieces of personal information to us. When you apply for or maintain a live or demo account with <i><b>FOREX</b>YARD</i>, we collect personal information about you for business purposes, such as evaluating your financial needs, processing your requests and transactions, informing you about products and services that may be of interest to you, and providing customer service. Such information may include: </p>
<ul class="ball">
<li>Application Information - Information you provide to us on applications and other forms, such as your name, address, birth date, social security number, occupation, assets, and income. </li>
<li>Transaction Information - Information about your transactions with us and with our affiliates as well as information about our communications with you. Examples include your account balances, trading activity, your inquiries and our responses. </li>
<li>Verification Information - Information necessary to verify your identity such as a passport or driver's license. Examples also include background information about you we receive from public records. The USA Patriot Act requires us to collect information and take actions necessary to verify your identity. </li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that if you choose not to disclose this information, functionality of our site may be limited.</p>

<h2>About Cookies</h2>

<p>In addition to personally identifiable information FOREXYARD.COM collects anonymous user information through the delivery of cookies. Cookies allow the FOREXYARD.COM Web site to be more efficient by allowing us to learn what information is important to our visitors, and what isn't. Such information that we collect and share would be anonymous.</p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a Web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the site administrator may identify your computer and passively track its activities on the Web site. A cookie will not allow a Web site to learn any personally identifiable information unless you have previously disclosed that information to us. </p>
<p>The use of cookies is an industry standard and is currently used on most major Web sites. Cookies allow Web sites to serve its customers better by providing measurement statistics on site usage, learn about areas of the site that are over or underutilized, and helps to ensure that you are logged into your account correctly. It is possible to adjust your Web browser preferences to alert you when a cookie is sent to your hard drive, or to refuse cookies altogether. While FOREXYARD.COM does not require you to accept cookies, certain services will not function properly if you do not use and accept cookies. </p>
<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in order to protect certain information that you submit. This type of technology protects you from having your information intercepted by anyone other than FOREXYARD.COM while it is being transmitted to us. We work hard to ensure that our websites are secure and that they meet industry standards. We also use other safeguards such as access control mechanisms to control unauthorized access to systems and data. 
FOREXYARD.COM uses efforts consistent with sound industry practice, such as firewalls and encryption, to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifying information. Given the nature of the Internet, however, the Company cannot and does not ensure complete security. The Company shall not be responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of any other person or entity. Hackers pose a threat to any Internet user, and the legal and regulatory status of matters on the Internet is uncertain both in the United States and abroad. For these reasons, the FOREXYARD.COM cannot and does not guarantee that all of your personal identifying information will never be disclosed in ways you do not expect or which are not described in this Privacy Statement. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to see that your information is treated in compliance with this Privacy Statement. The Company cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, we obey court orders, and we honor subpoenas and other legal process. Your personal identifying information may be disclosed if we are compelled by law or legal process to disclose it. We may also disclose such information if we determine, in our sole discretion, that disclosure would be useful in connection with investigating possible non-compliance either with the law or with any FOREXYARD.COM policy, including our Terms of Service or this Privacy Statement.</p>

<h2>Sharing Information With Our Affiliates</h2>

<p>We may share personal information described above with our affiliates for business purposes, such as servicing customer accounts and informing customers about new products and services, and as permitted by applicable law. Our affiliates may include companies controlled or owned by us. The information we share with affiliates may include any of the information described above. Our affiliates maintain the privacy of your information to the same extent FOREXYARD.COM does in accordance with this Policy. </p>
<h2>Sharing Information With Third Parties</h2>

<p>FOREXYARD.COM does not disclose your personal information to third parties, except as described in this Policy. Third party disclosures may include sharing such information with non-affiliated companies that perform support services for your account or facilitate your transactions with FOREXYARD.COM, including those that provide professional, legal, or accounting advice to FOREXYARD.COM. Non-affiliated companies that assist FOREXYARD.COM in providing services to you are required to maintain the confidentiality of such information to the extent they receive it and to use your personal information only in the course of providing such services and only for the purposes that FOREXYARD.COM dictates. </p>

<p>We may also disclose your personal information to third parties to fulfill your instructions or pursuant to your express consent. </p>
<h2>Changes in Privacy Statement and web site Maintenance</h2>

<p>As our business grows and changes, and as technology and Internet use and practices change, FOREXYARD.COM may, from time to time, determine that changes in its policies, including this Privacy Statement, are prudent. If any such changes are made, they will be posted on this web site. Therefore you should review this Privacy Policy and other policies posted on this web site for potential changes when you return to the site for future visits.</p>
<p>We want you to know that FOREXYARD.COM will not sell your personal information. </p>
