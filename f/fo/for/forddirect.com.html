							<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
							<div class="boxSkin-indent">
								At FordDirect, we care about consumer privacy, and we believe in providing transparency to consumers about our information practices. This Privacy Statement explains how 
								FordDirect collects, uses, discloses, and protects your information. <br><br>

								FordDirect is dedicated to helping visitors to our sites connect with Ford and Lincoln dealers ("Dealers"), Ford Dealership Associations ("Dealer Associations"), and Ford Motor 
								Company (and its affiliates and subsidiaries) to learn about Ford and Lincoln vehicles and related products and services. <br><br>
								This Privacy Statement applies to the information FordDirect collects about you through websites, applications, social media assets, software, and other services provided 
								by or on behalf of FordDirect. When you access, visit or use the Services, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure and retention of your information as described 
								in this Privacy Statement. <br><br>
								If a Service is co-branded or developed by a third party or linked to a third party, the third party's privacy statement may apply.<br><br>

							<a name="collectInfo"></a>
							<h4>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</h4>
							<div class="boxSkin-indent">
								<b>Information You Provide.</b> We and our vendors collect the information you voluntarily provide to us  in connection with using our Services, including through 
								product inquiries, requests for vehicle information, technical services or questions, product registration and support, events and promotions, job applications, 
								other inquiries and transactions. Our vendors also may collect information from you, including, for example, when you participate in our contests, sweepstakes, surveys, 
								and other promotions. Some portions of the Services may allow you to submit comments, reviews, ratings and other content.<br><br>

								<b>Information We Obtain from Affiliates, Business Customers and Others.</b> We may obtain information about you from outside sources. For example, our affiliates, Dealers 
								and Dealer associations that deploy FordDirect products and services, may share with us certain information you have previously provided to them. We also may obtain 
								commercially-available demographic information from third parties. If you engage with us, our affiliates or our business customers via social media, the social media 
								platforms also may share certain information with FordDirect. You may be able to adjust your social media privacy settings to limit the sharing of your social media data.<br><br> 

								<b>Information We Obtain by Automated Means.</b> We may collect information about your use of our Services or devices you use to connect to the Services by automated means, 
								including tracking technologies. These tracking technologies may include "cookies," which are small lines of text/data that are written onto your computer by a website. 
								FordDirect and vendors acting on our behalf may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other similar technologies to operate the Services. Most browsers allow you to 
								block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly. <br><br>

						</div>
						<div class="boxSkin-pad">
							<h4>DATA COLLECTION BY THIRD PARTIES</h4>
							<div class="boxSkin-indent">
								Our Services may include third-party advertising, promotions, co-branded features, links to other websites, and other programs offered by or in collaboration with 
								third-party businesses. In addition to collecting information directly from you, these third-party businesses may use web beacons and cookies to measure the 
								effectiveness of their ads, personalize or optimize advertising content, and track users who click on the links made available through the Services. When you 
								use our Services, these third-party businesses may collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. 
								We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties, and we encourage you to read their privacy policies, which may apply to these third-party 
								programs. Some third-party advertising companies may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their tracking or advertising. For example, they may be members of <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">the Network 
								Advertising Initiative</a> (which manages the privacy choices of its members) or other organizations that offer consumers <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">privacy choices</a>. <br><br>

							<a name="infoCollected"></a>
							<h4>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
							<div class="boxSkin-indent">
								<b>Information About You.</b> The information that you provide directly to us and that we obtain from others is what we need to serve you, our affiliates and business customers. 
								This information may include your contact details (such as name, postal or email address, phone number, Twitter handle or other online aliases); details about your vehicle and 
								Dealer transactions; contact information of individuals with whom you would like to share FordDirect content; social media identifiers; demographic information; and other 
								information you may choose to share with us by interacting with our Services or with our affiliates, business customers or other businesses that share information with us.<br><br>

								<b>Information About Your Device.</b> The information we collect by automated means also helps us, our affiliates and our business customers to provide and tailor various products 
								and services. We may collect the following details by automated means:<br><br>

								<p class="indented">
									<b><i>Usage Information.</i></b> We and our vendors may automatically collect your usage activity, preferences, and browser details (such as your IP address and browser type), 
									as well the ID and type of the device you use to connect to our Services, and other details about your use of our Services. This may also include the collection of information 
									about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. <br><br> 

									<b><i>Online Tracking.</i></b> Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other do-not-track ("DNT") mechanisms, FordDirect does not itself respond to web 
									browser-based DNT signals. However, certain of our websites participate in the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank">AdChoices</a> program. If the website that you are visiting displays an AdChoices icon, you may 
									click on the icon and follow instructions to adjust your privacy preferences. If you opt-out using AdChoices, our sites that participate in the program will no longer 
									collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services for behavioral advertising purposes.<br><br>

									<b><i>Location Data.</i></b> Some of our Services may collect geo-location data to provide location-related functionality, such as the location of your nearest Dealer. We may link 
									location data to other information we have collected about you. <br><br>

							<h4>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
							<div class="boxSkin-indent">
								We use your information to serve you, our affiliates and business customers. The following are general purposes for which we may use your information.<br><br>

								<b>Provide Products and Services.</b> We may, for example, use your information to complete a transaction you have asked us to do, including e-commerce transactions or "get a quote" or 
								"find a dealer" requests, or to send you communications regarding products, service reminders or vehicle information. <br><br>

								<b>Operate our Business and Develop and Improve Our Products and Services.</b> Examples include using information collected through cookies and similar technology to better understand 
								how our Services are used, develop new offerings, or personalize your experience in using the Services. <br><br>

								<b>Customer Service.</b> If you request support or other information, we may use your information to respond to your request. We may follow up with you to notify you periodically 
								about important topics, like Services updates or changes to our Privacy Statement. <br><br>

								<b>Marketing.</b> We may use your email address to let you know about current offers, invite you to participate in those offers and manage your participation in them. We also may 
								use information about your use of our Services to tailor our offers to your preferences or to offer you products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. Among 
								other privacy choices described in this Privacy Statement, you may direct us to not send you email marketing communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link included in the 
								emails you receive from us.<br><br>

								<b>Recruitment and Job Applications.</b> We may use the information submitted on resumes and similar documents through FordDirect for the purpose of employment consideration. We may 
								keep your information on file for future consideration.<br><br>

								<b>Compliance with Legal Requirements, Rules and Internal Policies.</b> We may be required by law or internal data retention policies to maintain information about you for a certain 
								period of time, or to notify you of a security breach. We also may be required by social media platform rules (such as Facebook) to handle the social media information you or 
								the platform share with us in a certain manner.<br><br>

							<h4>INFORMATION SHARING</h4>
							<div class="boxSkin-indent">
								This section describes the types of organizations with whom we may share your information.<br><br>

								<b>Within FordDirect.</b> FordDirect may authorize access to your information within our enterprise, by our employees and other personnel, to fulfill our obligations to you and to 
								operate our business.<br><br>

								<b>Affiliates and Vendors.</b> Our affiliates and vendors may access and use your information for the purposes we describe in this Privacy Statement, including as necessary to provide 
								functionality, products, and services to us and you in connection with the Services. For example, when you register for a sweepstakes, a vendor may process the sweepstakes entry. 
								FordDirect requires vendors to process your information under the direction of FordDirect and in accordance with this Privacy Statement, contractual restrictions, and applicable 
								law. We also may share data collected through cookies and similar technology with our vendors to advertise or market to you on other sites as you browse the web. We may allow our 
								affiliates and vendors to have access to aggregate statistics - that are not linked by us to any specific consumer - about consumer behavior, sales, traffic patterns, and related 
								Services information.<br><br>

								<b>Marketing Partners.</b> We may share your information with our marketing partners when, for example, we participate in a co-branded promotion with another company. We will not share 
								your personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes.  <br><br>

								<b>Your Public Comments.</b> Some portions of our Services may allow you to submit comments, reviews, ratings and other content. This content may be displayed on the Services and may 
								be viewable by other users of the Services or the public generally.  <br><br>

								part or all of its business, FordDirect reserves the right to disclose your information, including to prospective or actual purchasers in connection with one of these transactions.<br><br>

								<b>As Required by Law and Other Extraordinary Disclosures.</b> FordDirect may be required to disclose your information if it: <br>
								<ul>
									<li>believes it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority;</li>
									<li>would potentially lessen our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit or investigation; or</li>
									<li>is necessary to protect our or others' rights or property.</li>
