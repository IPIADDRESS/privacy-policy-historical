</ul><h4 class="terms">INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p class="terms">At FordDirect, we care about privacy, and we believe in providing transparency to consumers about our personal information practices. This Privacy Statement explains how FordDirect collects, uses, discloses, and protects your personal information.</p>

<p class="terms">FordDirect is dedicated to helping visitors to our websites and those that use and interact with our Services connect with Ford and Lincoln dealers (“Dealers”), Ford Dealership Associations (“Dealer Associations”), and Ford Motor Company (and its affiliates and subsidiaries) to learn about Ford and Lincoln vehicles and related products and services.</p>

<p class="terms">This Privacy Statement applies to the personal information FordDirect collects about you through websites, applications, social media, software, and other Services provided by or on behalf of FordDirect. <strong>When you use or interact with the Services, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure and retention of your information as described in this Privacy Statement. </strong></p>

<p class="terms">If a Service is co-branded or developed by a third party (such as RouteOne) or linked to a third party, the third party’s privacy statement may apply in addition to or in lieu of this Privacy Statement.</p>

<h4 class="terms">INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>

<p class="terms"><strong>Information About You.</strong> The information that you provide directly to us and that we obtain from others is what we need to serve you, our affiliates and business customers. This information may include your contact details (such as name, postal and email addresses, phone number, social media handles and other online aliases); information specific to the Service you request (such as financial information when you apply for credit); details about your vehicle and Dealer transactions; contact information of individuals with whom you would like to share FordDirect content; social media information; demographic and household information; your responses and engagement with our Services; and other information you may choose to share with us by interacting with our Services or with our affiliates, business customers, suppliers or other businesses that share information with us.</p>

<p class="terms"><strong>Information About Your Device.</strong> The information we collect by automated means also helps us, our affiliates and our business customers to provide and tailor various products and services. Examples of information we collect by automated means include the following:</p>

<p class="terms"><strong>Usage Information.</strong> We and our suppliers may automatically collect your usage activity, preferences, and browser details (such as your IP address and browser type), as well the ID and type of the device you use to connect or interact with our Services, and other details about your use or interaction with our Services. This may also include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services and across devices that you use.</p>

<p class="terms">FordDirect does not itself respond to web browser-based do-not-track signals. However, certain of our websites participate in the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">AdChoices</a> program. If the website that you are visiting displays an AdChoices icon, you may click on the icon and follow instructions to adjust your privacy preferences. If you opt-out using AdChoices, our websites that participate in the program will no longer collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services for behavioral advertising purposes.</p>

<p class="terms"><strong>Location Data.</strong> Some of our Services may collect geo-location data to provide or improve our Services and location-related functionality, such as the location of your nearest Dealer. We may link location data to other information we have collected about you.</p>

<h4 class="terms">HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</h4>

<p class="terms"><strong>Information You Provide.</strong> We and our suppliers collect the information you voluntarily provide to us in connection with using our Services, including through product inquiries, requests for vehicle information, financing requests, technical services or questions, product registration and support, events and promotions, job applications, other inquiries and transactions. Our suppliers also may collect information from you, including, for example, when you participate in our contests, sweepstakes, surveys, and other promotions. Some portions of the Services may allow you to submit comments, reviews, ratings and other content.</p>

<p class="terms"><strong>Information We Obtain from Affiliates, Business Customers, Suppliers and Others.</strong> We may obtain information about you from outside sources. For example, our affiliates, Dealers and Dealer associations that deploy FordDirect products and Services and suppliers may share with us certain information you provided to them. They may also inform us whether you have been approved for credit and related information. We also may obtain demographic and other information about you from third parties. If you engage via social media with us, our affiliates, our business customers, or our suppliers, the social media platforms also may share certain information with FordDirect. You may be able to adjust your social media privacy settings to limit the sharing of your social media data.</p>

<p class="terms"><strong>Information We Obtain by Automated Means.</strong> We may collect information about your use or interaction with our Services or about the devices you use to connect or interact with the Services by automated means, including tracking technologies. These tracking technologies may include “cookies,” which are small lines of text/data that are written onto your device by a website. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly. FordDirect and suppliers acting on our behalf may use cookies, pixel tags, beacons, web beacons, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi monitoring and other technologies to operate the Services. With your consent, we may also use video technologies to capture your demographic information and engagement with our Services in order to present you with a more personalized experience.</p>

<h4 class="terms">DATA COLLECTION AND USE BY THIRD PARTIES</h4>

<p class="terms">Our Services may include third-party advertising, promotions, co-branded features, links to other websites, and other programs offered by or in collaboration with third-party businesses. In addition to collecting information directly from you, these third-party businesses may use tracking technology to measure the effectiveness of their ads, personalize or optimize advertising content, and track users who click on the links made available through the Services. When you use or interact with our Services, these third-party businesses may collect information about you, including your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties, Dealers, Dealer Associations, and their suppliers, and we encourage you to read their privacy policies, which may apply to these third-party programs. Some of the ads you receive on websites are customized based on predictions about your interests generated from your visits to different websites. This type of ad customization is sometimes called “online behavioral” or “interest-based” advertising. The Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) provides a “<a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">Consumer Opt-out</a>" for certain companies that have agreed to provide that functionality.</p>

<h4 class="terms">HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h4>

<p class="terms">A primary use of your information is to serve you, which requires certain sharing with our affiliates and business customers. The following are examples of the types of general purposes for which we may use your information.</p>

<p class="terms"><strong>Provide Products and Services.</strong> We may, for example, use your information to complete a transaction you have asked us to do, including e-commerce transactions or “get a quote” or “find a dealer” requests, or to send you communications regarding products, service reminders or vehicle information. We may also, for example, use your information to provide you with an improved experience when interacting with us, our affiliates, Dealers and Dealer Associations.</p>

<p class="terms"><strong>Operate our Business and Develop and Improve Our Products and Services.</strong> Examples include using information collected through cookies and similar technology to better understand how our Services are used, develop new offerings, or personalize your experience when using the Services.</p>

<p class="terms"><strong>Customer Service.</strong> If you request support or other information, we may use your information to respond to your request. We may follow up with you to notify you periodically about important topics, like Services updates or changes to our Privacy Statement.</p>

<p class="terms"><strong>Marketing.</strong> We may use your information to let you know about current offers, invite you to participate in those offers and manage your participation in them. We also may use information about you, your use or your interaction with our Services to tailor our offers to your preferences or to offer you products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. Dealers, Dealer Associations and our affiliates may use your information for their own marketing purposes. Among other privacy choices described in this Privacy Statement, you may direct us to not send you email marketing communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link included in the emails you receive from us.</p>

<p class="terms"><strong>Recruitment and Job Applications.</strong> We may use the information submitted on resumes and similar documents through FordDirect and our suppliers for the purpose of employment consideration. We may keep your information on file for future consideration.</p>

<p class="terms"><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements, Rules and Internal Policies.</strong> We may be required by law or internal data retention policies to maintain information about you for a certain period of time, or to notify you of a security breach. We also may be required by social media platform rules (such as Facebook) to handle the social media information you or the platform share with us in a certain manner.</p>

<h4 class="terms">INFORMATION SHARING</h4>

<p class="terms">A primary use of your information is to serve you, which requires certain sharing with our affiliates and business customers. This section describes the types of organizations with whom we may share your information.</p>

<p class="terms">Within FordDirect. FordDirect may authorize access to your information within our enterprise, by our employees and other personnel, to fulfill our obligations to you and to operate our business.</p>

<p class="terms">Affiliates, Dealers, Dealer Associations and Suppliers. Our affiliates, Dealers, Dealer Associations and suppliers may access and use your information for the purposes we describe in this Privacy Statement, including as necessary to provide functionality, products, and services to us and you in connection with the Services. For example, when you register for a sweepstakes, a supplier may process the sweepstakes entry. FordDirect requires suppliers to process your information under the direction of FordDirect and in accordance with contractual restrictions and applicable law. We also may share data collected through cookies and similar technology with our suppliers to advertise or market to you on other websites as you browse the web. We may also allow our affiliates, Dealers, Dealer Associations and suppliers to have access and use aggregate statistics – statistics not linked by us to any specific consumer – about consumer behavior, sales, online activity patterns, and related Services information. Except as necessary to provide you with the Services, we will not provide our affiliates with personal financial information that we obtain when you use the Services to submit a request for credit.</p>

<p class="terms">Marketing Partners. We may share your information with our marketing partners when, for example, we participate in a co-branded promotion with another company. Other than as described in this Privacy Statement, we will not share your information with third parties for their own marketing purposes. Except as necessary to provide you with the Services, we also will not provide our marketing partners with personal financial information that we obtain when you use the Services to submit a request for credit.</p>

<p class="terms">Your Public Comments. Some portions of our Services may allow you to submit comments, reviews, ratings and other content. This content may be displayed on the Services and may be viewable by other users of the Services or the public generally.</p>

<p class="terms">Mergers, Acquisitions or Insolvency. If FordDirect should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if FordDirect should decide to buy, sell, or reorganize some part or all of its business, FordDirect reserves the right to disclose your information, including to prospective or actual purchasers in connection with one of these transactions.</p>

<p class="terms">As Required by Law and Other Disclosures. FordDirect may be required to disclose your information if it:</p>

<ul class="terms"><li>believes it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority;</li>
	<li>would potentially lessen our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit or investigation; or</li>
	<li>is necessary to protect our or others' rights or property.</li>
</ul><h4 class="terms">INFORMATION SECURITY</h4>

<p class="terms">We take reasonable measures to secure our systems and protect your personal information.
