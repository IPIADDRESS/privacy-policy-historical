<a class="bookmark" id="methods" title="methods" name="methods"></a><h3>Methods We Use to Collect Information</h3>
<p>A "cookie" is a small text file that helps us in many ways to make your visit to our website more enjoyable and meaningful to you. They allow us to tailor a website to better match your interests and preferences. There are a couple different types of cookies.</p>
<p>A "session" cookie is stored only in your computer's working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all your browser's windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever.</p>
<p>A "persistent" cookie is stored on your computer's hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until either a) they expire, b) they are overwritten with newer cookies, c) you manually remove them. Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some site functions or features.</p>
<p>Ford.com may use spot light ads/web beacons/GIF and/or pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to establish how many of the emails are actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to collect web usage analytics.</p>
<p>When you visit our website the server housing the pages automatically generates a "session log." We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we're providing is being used. The only data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which contains no personal information), the web site that referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits.</p>
<p>Users may be directed to ford.com via banner ads or site links. Ads or site links that are placed by ford.com use cookies or web beacons to deliver metrics on the effectiveness of the ads or links. They do not collect personal information from the user.</p>
<h3>Sharing Your Information</h3>
<p>Personal information that you provide to us in the course of requesting a product or service through this website may be gathered and stored in one or more of our corporate databases and be used for purposes of contacting you for things like promotional offers, marketing programs, or other communications from this website or other Ford Motor Company websites.</p>
<p>We may share personal information that we collect about you with other companies within the Ford Motor Company family of companies or subsidiaries. Our "family of companies" is the group of companies related to us by common control or ownership. We share information within this "family" as a normal part of conducting business and offering products and services to our customers.</p>
<p>Vendors, contractors or partners of ford.com who have access to your personal information in connection with providing services for ford.com are required to keep the information confidential and are not permitted to use this information for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for ford.com.</p>
<p>Site metrics for ford.com may be shared with other Ford Motor Company websites or subsidiaries or affiliates. The information shared will be aggregate data and will not include any of your personally identifiable information.</p>
