<b>Ford.com Privacy Statement</b><br>
We want you to get the most out of our Ford Motor Company site and to trust that we make every effort to protect your confidentiality. Personal information is either requested or required on many areas of Ford.com, to verify your identity and ensure that you qualify to use particular sections of the site.  The amount and type of information received depends on how you use our site. The information may be stored and used in order to enhance our relationship with you.<br>
<br>
Please take a few minutes to read our complete privacy statement so you can understand how information is used and the specific measures we take to protect your personal information. This page describes the policies of our company regarding any information we receive about you, while visiting Ford.com. <br>
<br>
<b>Normal Website Usage</b><br>
Visit Ford.com to access company, products, and services information, along with investment and media updates, without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information. The only data we collect and store during normal website usage is typical web server log data.  Examples of this type of data are: the name of your Internet service provider, the site that referred you to us, any pages you request, and the time and date of those requests etc.<br>
<br>
We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to benefit Ford.com users.  This same information may be shared with third parties in order to provide these services or to analyze, store, or aggregate the information. It may also be shared with other third parties, working with us to improve the services of Ford Motor Company or this website.<br>
<br>
<b>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
There are instances where Ford Motor Company requests personally identifiable information to provide site visitors with a service. This information, such as name, mailing address, email address, and type of request, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the request, as determined by Ford Motor Company, to fulfill your needs. To reiterate, all information you provide is used to improve the services offered by Ford Motor Company. This information may also be provided to our agencies for use on behalf of Ford Motor Company in accordance with our proscribed privacy statement. However, it is never provided or sold to any other company for that company's independent use.<br>
<br>
During the course of your visit, you may move to other Ford Motor Company websites, including the sites designed specifically for owners, to allow vehicle configuration, or intended to provide information about financing or sites specific to Ford Motor Company products.  In addition, this site may provide links to third party sites not controlled by Ford Motor Company, such as those belonging to Ford Motor Company product dealers or third party product review sites.   It is recommended that you check the specific privacy statements of any site before providing any personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>
<b>What are cookies?</b><br>
A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored within your browser when you visit a cookie-enabled website. As you browse the Web, cookie-enabled sites will send cookies to your browser, along with pages. Your browser probably has options that will let you control whether the browser accepts cookies, rejects cookies, or notifies you each time a cookie is sent to you.<br>
<br>
If your browser is set to reject cookies, cookie-enabled websites will not recognize you when you return. This provides you with anonymity, but it also makes it very difficult to offer you customized services. It is also less secure than using cookies, because all of your specific data must be sent to the website each time you view a page. Accepting cookies means your private data can stay at the Web server, and the only information transmitted over the Internet is your ID cookie.<br>
<br>
If your browser is set to accept cookies, any cookies that are sent to your browser are stored in your computer for a period of time. There are a few different types of cookies. A "session" cookie is stored only in your computer's working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all of your browser's windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever. A "permanent" cookie is stored on your computer's hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now. Permanent cookies stay on your computer until either<br>
a) they expire,<br>
b) they are overwritten with newer cookies,<br>
c) you manually remove them.<br>
<br>
We use cookies provided by Cyber Dialogue, Survey Site, and eCommerce software to develop generic web site metrics.<br>
<br>
<b>Ford Motor Company's Internet Services</b><br>
To use our Internet services, such as Investor Relations tools or Dealer Locator, we also require a certain amount of personally identifying information. That information may be in the form of a name, account number, vehicle identification number, zip code, or personal identification number. We use this information to verify that you are a Ford Motor Company customer or meet the criteria required to process your request. We may also use this information to enhance our understanding of you and improve our services.<br>
<br>
<b>Electronic Mail Containing Personal Information</b><br>
Website users may decide to send Ford Motor Company personally identifying information via email. We will use this information for the purpose identified in the email message and to enhance our understanding of you in order to improve our services to you.<br>
<br>
<b>Privacy Statement Revisions</b><br>
A revised privacy statement will only apply to data collected subsequent to its effective date on this version of the web site. Any revisions will be posted at least 7 days prior to its effective date. New versions of this web site may have a new privacy statement effective with its launch.<br>
