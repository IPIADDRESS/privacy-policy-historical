</section>
<section>
<h6>3.	TRANSPARENCY/NOTICE-TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</h6>

<ul>
<li>You may provide Personal Information directly to Fohr through interacting with the Services, participating in surveys, during events sponsored or held by Fohr, and requesting Services or information from Fohr.</li>
<li>As you navigate the Services, certain passive information may also be collected about your visit, including through cookies and similar technologies as described below.</li>
</ul>
<p>We endeavor to collect only that information which is relevant for the purposes of Processing. Below are the ways we collect Personal Information and how we use it.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h6>3.1	TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h6>
<p>Fohr collects Personal Information regarding its current, prospective, and former clients, customers, users, visitors, and guests (collectively "Individuals").</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Information You Provide Directly to Us.</b> When you use the Services or engage in certain activities, such as registering for an Account with Fohr, responding to surveys, requesting Services or information, or contacting us directly, we may ask you to provide some or all of the following types of information:
<ul>
<li><b>Account Creation.</b> We may collect Personal Information from you such as name, email address, phone number or mailing address when you create an Account. We may also collect financial data (i.e., credit card/billing information) along with demographic information, such as age gender, and zip code.</li>
<li><b>Communications with Us.</b> We may collect Personal Information from you such as email address, phone number or mailing address when you choose to request information about our Services, register for Fohr's newsletter that we may offer from time to time, request to receive customer or technical support, or otherwise communicate with us.</li>

If you do decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information which may include Personal Information. All information collected from your participation in our surveys is provided by you voluntarily. We may use such information to improve our products and/or Services and in any manner consistent with the policies provided herein.]</li>

You should be aware that, when you disclose information about yourself through Community Features, the Services will collect the information you provide in such submissions, including any Personal Information. If you choose to submit content to any public area of the Services, such content will be considered "public" and will not be subject to the privacy protections set forth herein.</li>
<li><b>Automatic Data Collection.</b> We may collect certain information automatically through our Services or other methods of web analysis, such as your Internet protocol (IP) address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising identifiers, IMEI, Advertiser ID, and other device identifiers that are automatically assigned to your computer or device when you access the Internet, browser type and language, geo-location information, hardware type, operating system, Internet service provider, pages that you visit before and after using the Services, the date and time of your visit, the amount of time you spend on each page, information about the links you click, search terms and pages you view within the Services, and other actions taken through use of the Services such as preferences.</li>

We use Technologies that are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a "<b>device</b>") that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, messaging, and tools, and to recognize you across devices.</p>
