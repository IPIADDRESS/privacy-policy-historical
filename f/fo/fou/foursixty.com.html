      </p>
      <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>

On occasion we use email address or other contact information to contact our Users to ask them for their input on our services.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also use personal information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze Site usage, to improve our content and product offerings, and to customize the Site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve the Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using the Site.

      <h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
      <p>
        Our primary purpose in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you become a User, we require you to provide various contact and identity information, billing information, and other personal information as indicated on the relevant forms on the Site (which vary, depending on what kind of User you are), and you are no longer anonymous to us. Where possible, on these forms we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, as you use the Site, you can from time to time enter or send to us personal information. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to become a User or by not using the particular feature of the Site for which the information is being collected.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use cookies and log data in various ways, as described below. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we use “persistent” cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site. Second, we use “session ID” cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and close your browser. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our Site.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use our Site, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends (“log data”). This log data may include information such as the browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Site’s technical administration, to increase the Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Site to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests.

This may involve the hosting of data, including personal information, on servers operated by those hosting companies. We take care to use only service providers that we believe are reputable and able to live up to our and your expectations, including about the handling of confidential information. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
        Foursixty strives to protect your personal information. For security of transactions, we use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts any information,  you send to us electronically. The encryption process protects your information, by scrambling it before it is sent to us from your computer. Once Foursixty receives your transmission, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our system. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. More information about security is available on the Site and in our Terms of Use.

      </p>
      <p>
        If you click on a link to a third-party site, you will leave the Foursixty site and go to the site you selected. If you elect to use a third-party product or service in conjunction with Foursixty, you yourself enter into a license agreement with the third party for use of their product or service and their use of your data. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as Foursixty. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to a Foursixty site, you should read that site’s privacy policy before providing any personal information.
