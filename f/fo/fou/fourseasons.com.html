			<b>1. Reviewing Our Web Site</b><br><br>
				<i>A. Initially Upon Contact With Our Web Site</i><br><br>
					When you visit our web site, you are initially given a "cookie", and your computer is assigned an ID number.
					A cookie is a commonly used device that tracks an individual userâ€™s preferences, and is capable
					of enhancing your visit to the site.  Cookies allow us to provide a customized experience without
					the visitor having to remind us of his or her preferences each time she or he visits our site.
					Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. Four Seasons cookies also do
					not follow visitors when traveling on the Internet after leaving the Four Seasons web site.<br><br>

					We also use cookies to collect and maintain aggregate web site data (such as the number of visitors to a
					particular site), which helps us see which areas are popular with our users and which are not. Among other
					things, this helps us improve and update the site, based on such data as total number of visitors and pages
					viewed.<br><br>

					If you do not want to accept cookies, you can block them by adjusting the settings on your Internet
					browser. Visitors should understand, however, that rejecting cookies will affect your ability to benefit
					from the conveniences afforded by the use of cookies, and you will not be able to use certain customization
					features associated with creating a user profile.<br><br>

					Once you have visited our web site and accepted our cookie,
					your ID number is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you visit our web site. Despite the fact
					that you remain anonymous until you enter personal information in the web site, the ID number allows us to
					log your session, so that we may better assist you should you need some individualized service or support.
					Once you enter personal information on the web site, we associate your ID number with your contact
					information so we can recognize you on a future visit. We also use it to keep track of information that
					appears to be of particular interest to you.<br><br>

					<i>B. While Browsing Our Web Site</i><br><br>
					While in the process of browsing our web site, you also provide us with information that does not
					reveal your personal identity - what type of destination you're seeking information about,
					for example. We use	this aggregated, anonymous data mainly for editorial purposes, but we do not
					connect it to any Personal Information, such as your name or address.<br><br>

					While you explore our web site for the information that interests you, you may wish to put in a specific
					"Information Request" about one of our hotels or resorts, or you may wish to participate in one
					of our on-line surveys or promotions. To respond to this request or to participate in our various
					programs, we may ask you for Personal Information, such as your name, zip/postal code, e-mail
					address, and phone number.<br><br>

					In the event you choose to provide us with this information, we will only use it for the purpose
					we have specified to you.  We will only e-mail you if you want us to, and you can choose a number of
					alternate methods by which to receive a reply to a request.
					Your transmittal of your personal data shall constitute your acknowledgment and agreement to the terms and
					conditions contained in this Privacy Policy. If you are uncomfortable providing this information over the
					Internet, you can always call our <a style="text-decoration:underline" href="http://www.fourseasons.com/contact_us/telephone_for_reservations.html">Worldwide Reservations Office</a> for more details.
					<br><br>

					If you wish, you may also submit your e-mail address in order to be placed on a subscription list or to
					receive other information. You will be placed on these lists only when you indicate your desire
					to be included. In deciding whether or not to join such lists, please note that	they are only used for
					internal purposes - we do not sell or rent our lists to anyone. In the event you choose to join one
					of our lists, you may ask to be removed from the list at any time.  Visitors will always have the
					ability to accept or decline any form of communication from Four Seasons.<br><br>


		<b>2. When Making a Reservation</b><br><br>

					<i>A. When Making a Reservation On Our Web Site</i><br><br>
					If you decide that you would like to make a reservation at any of our hotels or resorts, you will be linked
					to our reservation service site. Although it appears to be part of our site, the reservation site is, in fact,
					provided by Amadeus Travel Distribution, SA which provides an automated reservations and distribution system
					to the travel industry. We pass your computer ID number on to Amadeus, but they are unfamiliar with you.
					You can search for rates and availability at our hotels and resorts without providing any Personal
					Information.<br><br>

					Visitors to fourseasons.com who elect to make reservations online will be required to complete a reservation
					profile the first time they make a reservation.  When you create a reservation profile you will be asked to
					provide specific Personal Information, including your name, address and contact information, as well as
					certain guarantee and deposit information to secure your reservation, such as your credit card number.
					Your transmittal of your Personal Information shall constitute your acknowledgment and agreement to the terms
					and conditions contained in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

					Your credit card number will be verified using a checking sequence, but we do not authorize any payments at
					this point. Once your reservation is confirmed, Four Seasons will be sent all of the reservation information.
					From this point the information is sent to the selected hotel in exactly the same way as if you called us
					directly or if your travel agent made the reservation.<br><br>

					Due to the personal nature of the information you give when making a reservation through our web site, the
					reservation system is secure, such that your credit card number is protected with the most sophisticated
					encryption technology available and is transmitted on a private network.<br><br>

					We also receive a copy of the reservation profile at our web site excluding your credit card number connected
					to your ID number. We will then use that information to create a log in our web site database.<br><br>

					We also occasionally combine information from a number of web visitors in a way that does not identify any
					user, in order to identify user patterns.<br><br>

					<i>B. When Making a Reservation Through our Worldwide Reservations Offices or Hotels</i><br><br>

					Reservations can also be made by calling one of our Worldwide Reservation Offices (WROâ€™s) or by contacting a
					particular hotel or resort directly. When you make a reservation we may ask you for Personal Information
					such as your name, address, telephone number and method of payment. We may also obtain from you any room
					preferences or special requests. Personal Information obtained by a WRO will be sent in a secured
					communication to the relevant hotel. Confirmation of your reservation will be provided to you, generally by
					e-mail, directly from the hotel or resort.<br><br>



		<b>3. During your stay at a Hotel or Resort</b><br><br>
			During your stay, we record your itemized spending to properly assemble your folio, which sets out your room
			rate and other expenses billed to your room. We also record this information to comply with financial
			reporting requirements, including those imposed by our auditors and government regulators. Information
			particular to your stay may also be stored (i.e. health issues, payment difficulties). This stay specific
			information is stored at the particular hotel where you stayed and is combined with information from
			previous visits that you have made to that hotel. We may also collect certain information as required by
			local laws (e.g. passport number).<br><br>

			In addition, we may retain the content of any document (including comment cards, electronic documents such
			as e-mails and other similar forms of communication) that you send us before, during or following your stay.
			This information may be shared with employees of the hotel but will not be shared with any third party.
		</font></p>

		<hr noshade="" size="1">
			<font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:003366;">
			How do we store this information?</font>
		<hr noshade="" size="1">

		<p><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:333333;">
		<b>1. At the Hotel or Resort</b><br><br>

			Each hotel goes to great measures to ensure that all Personal Information is kept in a secure location,
			be it a database or filing cabinet. Furthermore, we take steps to ensure that only designated individuals
			have access to this information.
		<br><br>
		<b>2. In Our Guest Reservation System</b><br><br>

			In order to serve you better we also store certain guest information in our Guest Reservation System ("GUESTres").  GUESTres is a secure customer database stored on a dedicated server located in a data centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
			<br><br>
			The stored information includes guest name, address, phone numbers and credit card number.  When you make a reservation at another Four Seasons property, this information is sent to that hotel or resort.
			<br><br>
			We also store other transaction information in GUESTres, including the number of stays you have had at properties managed by Four Seasons and the number of nights of each stay. We do not share this information with other hotels.
		</font></p>

			What information is not secure?</font>
		<hr noshade="" size="1">
		<p><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:333333;">

	It is important to note that any e-mail communication is not secure. This is a risk inherent in the use of e-mail. Please be aware of this when requesting information or sending forms to us by e-mail (for example, from the Contact Us section of our web site). We recommend that you do not include any confidential information (i.e. credit card information) when using e-mail. For your protection, our e-mail responses to you will not include any confidential information.
	<br><br>
	Finally, Four Seasons cannot expressly warrant the operation of the reservation web site and/or matters relating to its security once you log on, as it is not our site. To be prudent, please be sure to always close your browsers when you are done using the reservation site. Although the session will terminate after a short period of inactivity, it is best to close your browsers immediately upon completion, since while you are logged on it is easier for someone to attempt to get access to your profile.

	<hr noshade="" size="1">
	<p><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:333333;">
	If you are invited and elect to create a Guest Profile, on our web site, you will be asked to furnish specific Personal Information.  You will also be asked to provide a password for use each time you log-in.  Once you have created a Guest Profile, we may add online session data to your Guest Profile on subsequent visits to our website. When you provide information, including revised information to your Guest Profile, we may use the information you provide to update other databases maintained by us.
	<br><br>
	By completing your Guest Profile you are considered to have provided consent to share your Personal Information within Four Seasons in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

	Why is Personal Information collected?</font>
	<hr noshade="" size="1">
	<p><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:333333;">

	<b>1.    To Provide Superior Customer Service</b><br><br>

	Personal Information is collected to assist us in making your reservation and providing the services you request at any of our properties, to ensure we meet your needs while you are staying with us and/or to allow us to contact you in relation to matters that arose from your stay with us.
	<br><br>
	Furthermore, by keeping certain Personal Information on file, such as information regarding guest history and itemized spending, former guests of Four Seasons have the ability to confirm prior transactions and reconcile statements or invoices.
	<br><br>
	<b>2.    To Keep Our Guests Informed</b><br><br>

	We may also use this Personal Information to advise you of promotions or to inform you of offers or other information that may be of interest to you.  In order to do this, your information may be shared with a third party, including a customer relationship management company and/or  a marketing and communications company. These companies are under contract with Four Seasons and must agree that guest information will never be sold, rented, exchanged or in any way transferred.
	<br><br>
	If you do not wish to receive information from Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts you may advise one of our hotels or send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:guest.historian@fourseasons.com">guest.historian@fourseasons.com</a>
	<br><br>
	<b>3.    For Marketing Research</b><br><br>

	Finally, we may wish to contact guests to conduct surveys or focus groups to
	receive your views of our properties and service delivery. Such information may be
	collected by a third party under contract with us and they will be required to
	protect your Personal Information as explained below. Occasionally we will combine
	information from a number of guests to better understand trends and expectations of
	our guests. Where this occurs, all identifiers are removed so that the aggregate
information cannot be linked to specific guests.

	Information is shared between certified data privacy personnel at individual Four Seasons hotels in certain limited circumstances, particularly where health or safety concerns have arisen in the past.
	<br><br>
	Further, if a guest does not pay the outstanding account on time, or acts in an unlawful manner in regards to payment obligations, this information may be shared among accounting personnel at Four Seasons properties.

	Agents, contractors or third party service providers of Four Seasons may receive your Personal Information in the course of providing services to Four Seasons to better serve the needs of our guests. Using contractual or other arrangements, Four Seasons ensures these parties protect your Personal Information in a manner consistent with the principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.
	<br><br>
	We will only share Personal Information about you outside Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts without your consent, where: (a) it is required or authorized by law (for example, in response to a legal subpoena); (b) it is required to provide you with services you have requested in which case you will be considered to have implied your consent (i.e. car rental); (c) if your stay has been paid for by a third party we will provide billing information to the paying party; (d) if you have failed to pay amounts owed to a property.
	<br><br>
	If Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts suspects any unlawful activity is taking place, it may investigate and/or report its findings or suspicions to the police or other relevant law enforcement agency.

	We understand that you may like to know what Personal Information we hold about you. We are happy to assist you with your request.
	To protect your Personal Information, however, we require that you prove your identity to us at the time your request is made.
	You may make a request to the Guest Historian at the Hotel where you stayed or to the Corporate Guest Historian as set out below.
	<br><br>
	When you make a request in person, we will require you to produce some form of photo identification such as a passport or a driverâ€™s license and you will be asked to sign a request form.
	<br><br>
	Where you make a request by other means, we require the request be made in writing via fax or letter including a copy of a government issued identification and signature. We also require home and business addresses and phone numbers so we can check them with our files and satisfy ourselves as to your identity.
	<br><br>
	The above information is required to create an audit trail of how the request has been handled. Where a request is made, any correspondence or application may be kept and added to your Personal Information.
	<br><br>
	Four Seasons reserves the right to decline access to your Personal information under certain circumstances. Where your Personal Information will not be disclosed, you will be provided with the reasons for this non-disclosure.

Changes will not apply retroactively to Personal Information for which you have given explicit consent, which was acquired before the change to the Privacy Policy except as may be required by law.
