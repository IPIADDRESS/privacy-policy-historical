            a web site in a storage place on your own computer. Our cookies do
            not contain any personally identifying information. We use cookies
            to track your computer's usage patterns on our site, and to enhance
            your visit to the site. We also use cookies to collect and maintain
            aggregate web site data (such as the number of visitors to a
            particular site) which helps us see which areas are popular with our
            users and which are not. Among other things, this helps us improve
            and update the site, based on such data as total number of visitors
            and pages viewed. If you don't like cookies, your web browser likely
            includes an option that allows you not to accept them. We don't
            recommend using this option, however, as it makes browsing our site

            allows us to log your session, so that we may better assist you
            should you need some individualized service or support. Once you
            enter personal information in the web site, we associate your ID

            decide you want to make a reservation at any of our hotels or
            resorts, you will be linked to our reservation service site.
            Although it appears to be part of our site, the reservation site is
            in fact provided by someone else. We pass your computer ID number on
            to them, but they are unfamiliar with you. You can search for rates
            and availability at our hotels and resorts without providing any
            personal information.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">Once you have determined that your requested reservation is
            available, you will be asked to give personal information including
            your name, address and contact information, as well as certain
            guarantee and deposit information to secure your reservation,
            including your credit card number. Transmittal of your personal data
            shall constitute your acknowledgment and agreement to the terms and
            conditions contained in this Privacy Statement. This site is secure.
            No one else is able to read the information you provide to the
            reservation site. Your credit card number will be verified using a
            checking sequence, but we do not authorize any payments at this
            point. Once your reservation is confirmed, Four Seasons will be sent
            all of the reservation information. From this point the information
            is sent to the selected hotel in exactly the same way as if you
            called us directly or if your travel agent made the reservation. We
            also receive a copy of the reservation at our web site except for
            your credit card number connected to your ID number. We will then
            use that information to create a log in our web site database. We
            also occasionally use it in aggregate for marketing services.
            However, we will not use it to market to you without your express
            permission.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">We
            will never share any of your personally identifying data with any

            <hr noshade="" size="1">
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">We
            always take the utmost care to ensure that the data we obtain from
            you is not used in a way that you may be unaware of or not agreeable
            to. For example, due to the personal nature of the information you
            give when making a reservation, the reservation system is secure,
            such that your credit card number is protected. However, there are a
            few special cases worth noting when you are contemplating giving
            personal information to us.</font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">It
            is important to note that any e-mail communication to and from our
            site is not secure. This is a risk inherent in the use of e-mail.
            Please be aware of this when requesting information or sending forms
            to us by e-mail (from the Contact Us section of the site). We
            recommend that you do not include any confidential information when
            using the e-mail forms in the site (for example do not provide
            credit card numbers here). For your protection, our e-mail responses
            to you will not include any confidential information.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">Finally, Four Seasons cannot expressly warrant the operation
            of the reservation web site and/or matters relating to its security
            once you log on, as it is not our site. To be prudent, please be
            sure to always log off when you are done using the reservation site.
            Although the site will log off automatically after 15 minutes, it is
            best to log off immediately upon completion, since while you are
            logged on it is easier for someone to attempt to get access to your
            profile.</font></p>
