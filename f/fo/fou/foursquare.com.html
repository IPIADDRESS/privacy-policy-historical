Privacy Policy</h2><p>This updated Privacy Policy covers Foursquare Labs, Inc. and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries, Placed, LLC, Foursquare Labs UK Limited, and Foursquare Labs Asia Pte. Ltd. (collectively, “Foursquare”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).</p><p>Foursquare knows that you take your privacy seriously. We do, too. We intend to be transparent with you about our data practices and to give you control over the information we collect about you (your “Data”), some of which may identify you or from which you may be identified (“Personal Information”).</p>Foursquare offers the following services:<ol><li>Consumer Services, which include our websites (<a href="https://foursquare.com/">www.foursquare.com</a>, <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/">developer.foursquare.com</a> and <a href="https://www.placed.com">www.placed.com</a>) (collectively, the “Sites”), our Foursquare City Guide, Swarm and Marsbot mobile applications (collectively, the “Foursquare Apps”), our features (i.e. attributes that Foursquare makes available, such as the ability for users to create lists), content (e.g. tips, reviews, photos that users may provide), and widgets (i.e. applications that allow users to access the Apps), and our Panel App, Give to Charity, Frequent Flyer, and Pathkeeper applications (collectively, the “Placed Apps”, and together with the Foursquare Apps, the “Apps”) (Apps, combined with the Sites, collectively, the “Consumer Services”); and</li><li>Enterprise Services, which include our media, attribution, segments, visit feeds, analytics, Application Programming Interface (“API”) and Software Development Kit (“SDK”) products (collectively, the “Enterprise Services”).</li></ol><p style="text-align: left;">This Privacy Policy is divided into four parts:<br><strong>Part I</strong> applies to Data about users of our Consumer Services (“Foursquare Users”).<br><strong>Part II</strong> applies to Data provided by customers of our Enterprise Services (“Enterprise Customers”) about users of Enterprise Customers’ products (“Partner End-users”).<br><strong>Part III</strong> applies to Data about individuals other than Foursquare Users and Partner End-users, such as individuals acting in their professional capacity as representatives of a third party developer, vendor, partner or enterprise customer.<br><strong>Part IV</strong> applies to all Data that we may collect and further process in the circumstances described in all of Parts I, II and III.</p><h3>Part I – Foursquare Users</h3><p>Below are the types of Data we collect about Foursquare Users and the ways in which we may collect, use and share that Data.</p><h4>What Data Does Foursquare Collect</h4><div class="subhead">Data You Provide To Us:</div><p>We receive and store Data that you provide to us when you create an account and use our Consumer Services. When you create an account, we collect your full name, email address, phone number, birthday, gender, the city in which you created your account, and where applicable, your Twitter, Facebook, Google or other social media username and other Data if you create an account using your third party log-in credentials (please see “Data Received From Third Parties” below). As you interact with us and use our Consumer Services, we also collect other Data that you directly provide to us, which on the Sites and Foursquare Apps may include pictures that you choose to upload to your account, any messages that you send to other users of the Apps, any restaurant or other venue searches you make, your likes, who you follow, check-ins, comments or tips you make, whether you have created or edited venues, and in the Placed Apps, survey responses, demographic information, and in both cases, any other Data that you voluntarily provide to us.</p><div class="subhead">Data Collected When You Use Our Consumer Services:</div><p>If you opt-in to sharing your location with us, we automatically receive Data about your location and/or IP address whenever you interact with, or use, the Consumer Services (e.g. open the App, visit our Sites, etc.). If you opt-in to have background location turned on in our Apps, we will collect Data about you even when you are not using the Apps and the Apps are closed (as permitted by your device settings).</p><p>We use various technologies to determine your precise location, such as the location services of your operating system or browser, sensor data from your device (e.g. magnetometer, barometer, gyroscopes, accelerometers, compasses, Bluetooth data, beacon data, Wi-Fi access points, GPS data, and cell tower data), and other Data that may help us to understand your precise location.</p><p>We also collect additional Data about you when you use the Consumer Services. For example, we receive Data:</p><ul><li>relating to how you interact with the Consumer Services, such as your search terms, what pages you view, your access times, the time you spend on each page, your IP address, the redirected pages, or posts you make to the Consumer Services;</li><li>relating to your device, such as your hardware model, operating system and version, unique ID and device identifiers, sensor activity, browser type, language, and wireless network, mobile device name, mobile apps installed; and</li><li>collected by cookies and other technologies, such as cookie ID, advertising ID or other unique advertising ID, web beacons, local storage and pixels. You can control certain types of cookies through your browser settings or other tools. You may review our <a href="https://foursquare.com/legal/cookiepolicy">Cookie Policy</a> for further information.</li></ul><p>You may turn off location services at any time by going to your device settings and toggling off background location. For more information about location, please see “Determining and Sharing Location” below.</p><div class="subhead">Data Received From Third Parties</div><p>We may receive Data about you from third parties, including Enterprise Customers (e.g. customers of our Media Products) and/or third parties with services that interact with the Consumer Services or that provide services to us, such as unaffiliated apps and websites (e.g., websites and applications offered by third party developers that integrate with our API, referral partners, advertising exchanges, ad platforms, ad networks or from our partners), and from other business partners, including third parties from whom we license Data. This Data includes Data about your activity when using the Consumer Services or on unaffiliated websites and apps, or Data received from web browsers or operating systems such as browser types and settings, the operating systems, device models, carriers, location information, IP address, mobile device and advertising identifiers (e.g. Apple IDFA or Google Advertising ID), as well as cookie information, pixel or other similar technology. If you created your account using your Google, Twitter or Facebook account profile, we may receive certain information from these companies, such as your first name, last name, gender, birthday, email address and your unique ID assigned from these social media platforms. All data collection is in accordance with the authorization procedures granted by the applicable social media platform.</p><h4>How Is My Data Used?</h4><p>Below are the ways that we use Data about Foursquare Users.</p><div class="subhead">To Operate, Maintain And Improve The Consumer Services</div><p>We use your Data to operate and maintain the Consumer Services, and to understand you better and tailor the Consumer Services to you. If you download more than one App, we combine your Data provided in each App. If you use the Consumer Services when you are not logged into your Foursquare account, when you subsequently log into your Foursquare account, we combine Data collected while you were not logged in with your Foursquare account.</p><p>We also use your Data for research and development, to improve the Consumer Services, or to offer new products, features and tools, and to infer certain details about you, including demographic information and whether separate devices are owned by you or by members of your household, but only to the extent that this is in compliance with applicable law. For example, we may redesign the Apps to make it easier for you to search for restaurants in Foursquare City Guide or to earn points or rewards in the Panel App from Placed. We also use your Data to customize our Apps and Sites to provide you with your own personalized  experience. We do this by inferring your interests and preferences, looking at your search history, or in the Foursquare Apps, by allowing you to find and add friends who are also using the Foursquare Apps and Sites from your device’s contact list or, if applicable, your Facebook, Google or Twitter account, if you have opted to connect these accounts to your Foursquare account. In these situations, we do not store your contact lists.</p><p>We also use your Data to help us map Locations (as defined below). For example, we may use device signals to determine that a particular device is within a particular venue. Additionally, if you consent to sharing crash data (when the Apps crash) with us, we may use that data to help us analyze the cause of the crash.</p><div class="subhead">Communicate With You</div><p>We use your Data to communicate with you, including by email, text (only if you opt-in), or in our Apps, about new product offerings, updates to the Consumer Services, or anything else we think may be of interest to you. To opt out of receiving Foursquare marketing and promotional communications, please click <a href="/settings/notifications">here</a> and follow the instructions.

When such Data is shared with our partners to measure conversion, the Data is blurred so that your detailed location trail history cannot be retraced or identified. We may also share or disclose aggregated or anonymous Data to other third parties, including Foursquare Users you may follow, and developers who use our API or SDK, or our other Enterprise Customers, for analytical or other purposes.

If you have your location services turned on, whenever you open and use or interact with our Apps (e.g. write a tip, check in to a restaurant, or take surveys to earn points or receive other benefits) on your mobile device, we collect and use your location data from your mobile device (e.g., latitude and longitude) to tailor the Consumer Services to your current location (i.e. we’ll show you a list of nearby locations) or to invite you to participate in a survey). We will only process your location data with your express permission.

While your location will still be collected by us, you can check-in “off the grid” so that you are not sharing your specific whereabouts with friends.</p><p>Each of your check-ins using the Consumer Services is saved to your "Check-in History," which allows you and your friends to look back at the locations where you have checked in since you created your account.

We may also share Data with third-party developers via flat data files, and may receive a flat data file from developers in return.</p><h4>SDK Products</h4><p>App developers partner with us to use our SDK, which they integrate into their own apps to help them identify when Partner End-Users are near interesting places of relevance to their service (e.g. a nearby store with respect to which they can offer a coupon), personalize content or information alerts for their locale, identify accurate venue data (such as the geo-coordinates of a restaurant or store) or to better understand their end users by identifying how often their end users have visited a specific venue or chain store (“Visit Data”). When partners use our SDK, we receive certain Partner End-User Data back (e.g. wifi end points, Visit Data, and other Data) if our Partner has contractually agreed to allow us to retain and use such Partner End-User Data. We incorporate such Partner End-User Data into our Enterprise Services, and if contractually permitted, license such Partner End-User Data to business partners.
