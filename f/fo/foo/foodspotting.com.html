We record information relating to your use of the Foodspotting Service, such as the searches you undertake, the pages you view, your browser type, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp information. We use this type of information to administer the Foodspotting Service and provide the highest possible level of service to you. We also use this information in the aggregate to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the Foodspotting Service. You cannot be identified from this aggregate information.</p>
