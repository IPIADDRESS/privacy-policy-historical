        Your privacy is important to Foodsby LLC (“Foodsby”), and we go to great lengths to protect it. This Privacy Policy applies to the online collection of
        personal information via software and Internet services and is incorporated into any applicable user agreement and service terms and any general terms of
        use for the website found at <a href="https://www.foodsby.com/">www.foodsby.com</a> (“Site”; collectively, “Services”). This Policy does not apply to
        information collected in any other way. The Services may contain links to sites maintained by others. This Privacy Policy does not reflect the privacy
        practices of those sites. By using the above Services, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to Foodsby’s processing of personal information
        and non-personal information for the purposes provided in the Privacy Policy. You further consent to reviewing the Privacy Policy from time to time to view
        any updates.

    <p>
        <strong>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES FOODSBY COLLECT AND HOW DO WE USE IT?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We collect information about our users in three ways: directly from the user, from our web server logs, and through cookies. We use the information
        primarily to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful
        to you. We don't share any of the information you provide with others, unless we say so in this Privacy Policy, or when we believe in good faith that the
        law requires it or when you authorize us to (for example, to our restaurant partners from whom you may order and receive food delivery).
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>User-Supplied Information</u>

    <p>
        In order to offer and provide a customized and personal service, we may use cookies to store and help track information about you. Cookies are simply small
        pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to help remind us who you are and
        to help you navigate our sites during your visits. Cookies allow us to save passwords and preferences for you so you won't have to reenter them each time
        you visit.
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of cookies is relatively standard. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. However, if you prefer, you can set your browser to either

    <p>
        <u>Third Party Services</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        We may use services hosted by third parties, such as Google® Analytics, to assist in providing our services and to help us understand our customers' use of
        our products. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including your IP address or cookies. If these
        third party services collect information, they do so anonymously and in the aggregate to provide information helpful to us such as website trends, without
        identifying individual visitors. Please see "Cookies" in the section above for information on how you can control the use of cookies on your computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Children’s Privacy</u>
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
        <strong>HOW DOES FOODSBY PROTECT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IT COLLECTS?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We have implemented certain appropriate security measures to help protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use,
        or disclosure. For example, some of our websites are protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Also, we store the information about you in a
        data center with restricted access and appropriate monitoring, and we use a variety of technical security measures to secure your data. In addition, we use
        intrusion detection and virus protection software. However, please note that we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will always be unable to defeat
        our security measures.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, please note that we may store and process your personal information in systems located outside of your home country. However, regardless of where
        storage and processing may occur, we take appropriate steps to ensure that your information is protected, consistent with the principles set forth under
        this policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>WHO HAS ACCESS TO THE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We will not sell, rent, or lease mailing lists or other customer data to others, and we will not make your personal information available to any
        unaffiliated parties, except as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        · To restaurant partners, agents and/or contractors who may use it on in connection with their relationship with us (for example, restaurants will use your
        personal information to deliver food orders you placed on the Site).
    </p>
    <p>
        · As required by law, in a matter of public safety or policy, as needed in connection with the transfer of our business assets (for example, if we are
        acquired by another company or if we are liquidated during bankruptcy proceedings), or if we believe in good faith that sharing the data is necessary to
        protect our rights or property.
    </p>
    <p>
        · We may rely on affiliates for support of the products and services we offer. If so, our affiliates would be required to preserve the confidentiality of
        any personal information they may access.
    </p>
    <p>
        · We will not disclose any information about your unique usage to unaffiliated third parties, except as necessary to service the account, to enforce the
        terms of use, to meet our obligations to content and technology providers, including their ability to offer products and services, or as required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        · As noted above, we may use statistics or other data regarding your usage of the Services for product development or other business analytic purposes, but
        only in anonymized aggregate form. We may make such data and statistics available to third parties, such as potential or existing customers, for business
        development, marketing or sales purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your access to some of Services and content may be password protected. We recommend that you refrain from disclosing your username(s) and password(s) to
        anyone. We also recommend that you sign out of your account or service at the end of each session. You may also wish to close your browser window when you
        have finished your work, especially if you share a computer with someone else or if you are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet
        cafe.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>HOW MAY I CORRECT, AMEND, OR DELETE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION AND/OR UPDATE MY PREFERENCES?</strong>
