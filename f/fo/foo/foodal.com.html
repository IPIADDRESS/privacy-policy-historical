      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>Welcome to Foodal.com (“Foodal.com”), owned, produced and   operated by Foodal.com Inc. (“Company”) and, potentially, in part or in   whole, by its parents, subsidiary and affiliate corporations,   successors, and assigns (collectively referred to as “Companies”).   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any current, updated and new   products and services (“Products and Services”), including the addition   of new properties shall be subject to this Privacy Policy, as well as   the General Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms and Conditions”).   By   using Foodal.com you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and the   Terms and Conditions, whether or not you register as a listener   (“Listener”).  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. </p>
          <p>Foodal.com is a music-oriented content and information website   that provides a service to musical artists and to record companies on   behalf of musical artists (each an “Artist” and collectively “Artists”)   to post information regarding themselves as well as musical content   owned and/or created by them.  Foodal.com members can view each others'   profiles (“Profiles”), communicate with each other, share photos, post   journals and comments, and describe their interests. Registered   Users can change their Profile information at any time and can   control how other Users and the service communicates with them.    Users and Artists are sometimes referred to hereinafter individually   and collectively as “Users.” </p>
          <p>Foodal.com cares about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at legal[at]Foodal.com[dot]com.</p>
          <h4>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE BY Foodal.com</h4>
          <p>Foodal.com collects User submitted personal information such as   name, mailing address, email address, telephone number and age to   authenticate Users, and to send notifications to those Users relating   to, without limitation, the Foodal.com service, special events, contests   and special offers. </p>
          <p>As is standard practice on many corporate websites, Foodal.com   also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address,   profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from   Users and other visitors to the site.  This data is used to improve   the website services, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to   track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic   information about our user base as a whole. Foodal.com will not use the   information collected to market directly to that person.  This   non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties   to provide more relevant services and advertisements to Users. User   IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.</p>
          <p>In addition Foodal.com uses pixel tags — tiny graphic images — to   tell us what parts of our website have been visited or to measure the   effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site.  Pixel tags   also enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read.    And they tell us whether emails have been opened to assure that we’re   only sending messages that are of interest to our customers. Foodal.com   stores all of this information in a secure database.</p>
          <p>Listener Profile information including Users' pictures and   first names is displayed to people in order to facilitate user   interaction in the Foodal.com social networking community. Users'   full names are never directly revealed to other Users.</p>
          <p>Foodal.com may also use a Listener’s email address to send   updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service.  Foodal.com may   send email messages which use a “click-through URL” linked to content on   the Foodal.com website. When a customer clicks one of these URLs, they   pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page.   Foodal.com tracks this click-through data to help determine interest in   particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer   communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking   text or graphic links in the email.</p>
          <p>From time to time, Foodal.com or a partner may sponsor a   promotion, sweepstake or contest on Foodal.com. Users may be asked   to provide personal information including name, email address or home   address or to answer questions in order to participate. Foodal.com may   transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have   explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at   the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and   whose privacy statement will apply. </p>
          <p>Foodal.com may also collect information for market research   purposes to gain a better understanding of our customers and thus   provide more valuable service. Foodal.com also collects information   regarding customer activities on our website, and on related websites.    This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to   customers and to understand which parts of our websites and Internet   services are of most interest to them.</p>
