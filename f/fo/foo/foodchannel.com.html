		<p>Food Channel may use “cookies” or “web beacons” to track how Users use the Web Site.  A cookie is a piece of software that a web server can store on Users’ PCs and use to identify Users should they visit the Web Site again.  Users may adjust their web browser software if they do not wish to accept cookies.  Food Channel may use third party advertising networks to serve advertisements on the Web Site.

		<h3>Disclosure of Information</h3>
		<p>Food Channel may disclose information collected from Users to trusted affiliates, independent contractors and business partners who will use the information for the purposes outlined above or for the specific purposes for which the information was collected.  Food Channel may disclose information at the request of law enforcement or governmental agencies or in response to subpoenas, court orders or other legal process, to establish or exercise Food Channel’s legal rights or defend against a legal claim or as otherwise required by law.  Food Channel may disclose information to investigate or prevent a violation by User of any contractual or other relationship with Food Channel or the perpetration of any illegal or harmful activity.
