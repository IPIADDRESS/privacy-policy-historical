			             What Information Is Collected?<br>
			             Alliance Atlantis collects three kinds of information 
			             from our web site(s):<br>
			             (1) your voluntarily provided personal information; 
			             (2) anonymous information about your visit, and: (3) 
			             "cookie" based information to help us track 
			             which pages on our web site(s) you're most interested 
			             in.<br>
			             1. Your Personal Information:<br>
			             During normal Web site(s) usage, you can visit our 
			             site without communicating any personal information. 
			             However, to make use of certain features on our site, 
			             such as contests, quizzes, promotions, personalized 
			             services, subscriptions or newsletters, users may 
			             need to register with the Alliance Atlantis web site(s). 
			             As part of this voluntary registration, Alliance Atlantis 
			             may request contact information (such as name, mailing 
			             address, e-mail address, etc.) and other data required 
			             for operating these services. The only way we can 
			             collect personal information from you is if you voluntarily 
			             provide it to us with your consent. By voluntarily 
			             providing this personal information to us by sending 
			             us a comment or suggestion, by entering a chatroom 
			             or bulletin board, or by entering a contest that is 
			             posted on our web site(s), you will be consenting 
			             to the collection, use and distribution of your personal 
			             information by Alliance Atlantis for the purposes 
			             of running the contest and/or for distribution to 
			             sponsors who manage the contests and for purposes 
			             of marketing (for example the sponsor may directly 
			             contact the contestant to promote products and services) 
			             and/or distribution to third parties who may participate 
			             in chatrooms and bulletin boards on the web site(s). 
			             You are under no obligation to provide us with this 
			             personal information and can access and enjoy many 
			             parts of the Alliance Atlantis web site(s) without 
			             providing us any personal information. However, for 
			             clarity, please understand that by volunteering this 
			             personal information you are also agreeing to its 
			             collection, use and distribution for the purposes 
			             stated below.<br>
			             We will or may at our discretion, use the personal 
			             information collected in the following ways:<br>

			             boards;<br>
			             · To keep aggregate information on web site(s) 
			             use. <br>
			             You should be aware that when you share personal information 
			             in public areas of our web site(s), such as chat rooms,

			             visitors, we keep track of the pages visited by our 
			             users by placing a small entry-in text file, called

			             is transferred to your browser by a Web server and 
			             can only be read by the server that gave it to you.<br>
			             Cookies do not reveal personal information. The only 
			             personal information a cookie can contain is information 
			             you supply yourself such as passwords, purchases and 
			             preferences. Cookies cannot read data from your hard 
			             drive.<br>

			             as their names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers) 
			             over the Internet. We will not knowingly encourage 
			             any minor to register with our site or to access those 
			             features which require registration. If a child has 
			             provided us with personal information, Alliance Atlantis 
			             asks that any concerned parent or guardian of the 
			             child contact us.<br>
