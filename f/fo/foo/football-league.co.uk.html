We use various tools to help us with this, including Google Analytics (see our&nbsp;Cookies Policy&nbsp;for further details).

Automated processes may assess your eligibility to receive services such as iFollow subscriptions (where offered on the Site), based on the information you provide – if you think that process has incorrectly refused you a subscription, let us know why and we will have a human review it.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<p>Processing your data for this purpose will usually be necessary (i) to perform any contract with you as applicable for the relevant service (ii) to comply with legal obligations where applicable or (iii) otherwise for our legitimate interests in complying with third-party requirements which enable us to provide the service(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Payments and Finance</i></b>- to collect payments from you for any paid for products or services, and/or administer any payments which may become due to you.&nbsp; This will usually be necessary (i) to perform any contract with you for the paid for service where relevant (ii) to comply with legal obligations where applicable or (iii) otherwise for our legitimate interests in recovering debts due to us.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Participation and Interactive Features (if any)</i></b>- to enable you to participate in chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups on or associated with the Site on which you can post information (if any)&nbsp; and, where we deem necessary, to respond to any such posts you make. Information you post in these areas may become public information and must always comply with our&nbsp;<a href="/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a>. The processing of your personal data here will usually be necessary (i) to perform any contract with you for the relevant service or (ii) for our legitimate interests in running and improving our services and managing our relationship with you as a customer.</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Marketing &amp; Associated Profiling</i></b>- to alert you to information about events, surveys, competitions, offers, products, services and other exciting updates relating to us, your Club and/or commercial partners.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>We only do this through email, sms, automated phone calls or online direct messaging (such as using any private message facility on the Site or as may be permitted on associated social media platforms) where you have agreed, so this is on the basis of your consent. However, if you are an existing customer we may contact you about our products or services similar to those you have previously received or enquired about (unless you have chosen not to receive such communications).</p>

This type of bespoke advertising (and any postal marketing) is carried out on the basis it is necessary for the legitimate interests of us or applicable commercial partners in marketing relevant products, services and exciting offers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Research, Analysis &amp; Personalisation</i></b>- to carry out market research so that we can improve the products and services we offer, and in some circumstances personalise content (including advertising as mentioned earlier) delivered to you. Your feedback is valued and helps to inform the commercial strategy, marketing activity and initiatives across the EFL Group and Your Club.

<p>In relation to personal data sent to the US, we usually check whether the ‘Privacy Shield’ applies – that ensures a similar level of protection to personal data shared within the EEA.
