<h2>FOO FIGHTERS ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
Foo Fighters understands the privacy concerns 
of visitors to our Internet website ("Site"). We have created this privacy 
statement to explain what information we collect from your visit to our Site, 
how that information is used, and the choices you have regarding the collection 
and use of such information.<br>
<b><br>
Use of Certain Information</b><br>
<br>
As a general practice, we do not automatically collect personally 
identifiable information (such as your name, mailing address or e-mail address) 
from your visit to our Site. We only gather personal information from visitors 
to our Site if that information is voluntarily submitted. However, certain non-personal 
information (such as the type of browser and operating system being used, and 
your IP address) is recorded by our servers when you visit our Site. This information 
is collected so we can provide you with a more personalized interactive experience 
on our Site.<br>
<br>
Depending on the activities on the Site in which you choose to participate, we 
may request that you provide us with certain information about yourself in order 
to participate in those activities. Our registration forms and surveys may request 
that you give us contact information (such as your name, mailing address and e-mail 
address), demographic information (such as your age and gender) and profile data 
(such as your preferences in entertainment). This information may be used by us 
and may be shared with our affiliates, subsidiaries and promotional partners for 
marketing and promotional purposes. On occasion, we may use your contact information 
to send you information about our products and services, and about us and what 
we're doing. You may always opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Opt-Out 
Election section below. We will not sell or lease your personally identifiable 
information to third parties, and will not use your personally identifiable information 
in any way other than as provided in this privacy statement <br>
<br>
If you request information, products or services through the Site, we may use 
order forms to collect contact information (such as your name, mailing address 
and e-mail address) and, when appropriate, financial information (such as your 
credit card number), to process your request. Contact information from an order 
form may be used to get in touch with you when necessary regarding your order. 
Any financial information collected to process your request will not be shared 
with third parties who are not involved with the transaction. When credit card 
information is transmitted, we use industry standard SSL (secure socket layer) 
encryption.<br>
We will disclose information gathered from the Site when required by law or upon 
the request of a law enforcement agency. We may also disclose user information 
in cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary 
to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing 
injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with our rights 
or property, other Foo Fighters Site users, or anyone else that could be 
harmed by such activities.<br>
<br>
<b>Use of Cookies and IP Addresses</b><br>
<br>
Cookies are files containing information about a user that 
a website transfers to a user's hard drive. We use cookies to enhance the user's 
experience on our Site by, among other things, saving user passwords and preferences. 
The cookies we place on a user's hard drive are used only in connection with our 
Site and do not contain personal information unless the user provides that information 
to us. If you do not want websites to be able to store cookies on your hard drive, 
you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to alert you when a cookie 
is being sent. However, disabling the use of cookies may affect the proper functioning 
of the site or may slow down the site considerably.<br>
<br>
An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer by your Internet service 
provider when you are surfing the Web. When you access our Site, our servers log 
your IP address. We collect and use IP addresses to gather information on the 
use of our Site, analyze trends, administer the Site, and to aggregate demographic 
information. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Chat Areas and Bulletin Boards</b><br>
<br>
Users of our Site are solely responsible for the content of 
messages they post on our Site, such as in any chat rooms or bulletin boards which 
may be supported by the Site. Users should be aware that when they voluntarily 
disclose personal information on bulletin boards or in chat areas, that information 
can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited contacts from 
other people.<br>
<br>
Each user who wishes to participate in any chat room or bulletin board which may 
be supported on this site must provide an e-mail address in addition to the user's 
screen name. Your participation in these features gives consent to having your email address included in our mailing list. In order to send a so-called "postcard," the sending user 
must provide the sender's screen name and e-mail address and the recipient's name 
and e-mail address in addition to the sender's message. We request those e-mail 
addresses in order to protect the security and integrity of the Site, including 
taking action against users who post inappropriate material or harass other users.<br>
<br>
<b>Links to Other Sites</b><br>
<br>
This Site is linked to websites operated by other companies. We are not responsible 
for the content or privacy practices of such other sites, and we recommend that 
you read the privacy statements of each website that you link to through us. This 
privacy statement applies only to the information collected by this Site.<br>
<br>
<b>Security</b><br>
<br>
The security of your personal information is very important 
to us. We strive to ensure the security of the information that you submit to 
us, and we have implemented various procedures to safeguard your personal information. 
Among other things, we use encryption software to protect the transmission of 
credit card information, and we require agents and contractors related to our 
Site to comply with our online privacy policy. However, data transmission over 
the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee 
or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or that is transmitted 
to you, and you do so at your own risk. <br>
<br>
<b>Information for Parents Concerning Privacy </b><br>
<br>
We do not knowingly collect, use or retain any personal information, 
for any purpose whatsoever (including internal or external marketing or promotional 
purposes) from visitors to the Site who are under the age of 13. In addition, 
we will delete any records of such personal information that come to our attention. 
We do not allow children under the age of 13 to provide personal information, 
to receive direct e-mail or marketing communications from Foo Fighters or 
from our third party affiliates or licensees, to participate in the chat rooms 
or bulletin boards which may be supported by the Site, or to register for contests, 
sweepstakes, promotions, or newsletters. If you believe your child has provided 
us with personal information at the Site, or if you believe your child has received 
inappropriate access to email or marketing communications, we invite you to notify 
us at the web contact listed below so we may delete the information from our records 
and discontinue any related features or services (see the Opt-Out Election section 
below). <br>
