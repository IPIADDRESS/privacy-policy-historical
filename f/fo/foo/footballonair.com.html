      <h2>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h2>
      <p>FootballOnAir  allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks,  to serve advertisements within the FootballOnAir Sites. These third-party ad  servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your  browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the FootballOnAir Sites.  They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may  also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web  Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to  personalize the advertising content you see.</p>

However, please note that if an  advertiser asks FootballOnAir to show an advertisement to a certain audience  (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men  ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond  to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that  you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The  advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the FootballOnAir  Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any  personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver  to you.</p>
