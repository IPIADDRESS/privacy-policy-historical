		<h1>Privacy Policy for foodbloggerpro.com</h1> 

		<p>Effective May 24, 2018</p>

<p>As the owner of this website (foodbloggerpro.com, referred to as the “Site”), Food Blogger Pro LLC understands that your privacy is of critical importance. This Privacy Policy describes what information we collect from you via the Site and how we use and disclose such information.</p>

<p></p><p><b>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOW IS IT USED?</b>
</p><ul>
<li><b>Information You Voluntarily Submit to the Site:</b> We may collect personal information from you such as your name or email address. For example, you may voluntarily submit information to the Site by leaving a comment, subscribing to a newsletter, or submitting a contact form. In addition, we may ask you to create a user profile, which would allow you to create a username and password. We will store the username, but your password will not be visible in our records.</li>
<li><b>Information We Collect from Others:</b> We may receive information about you from other sources. For example, if you use a third-party software through the site, they may transfer information to us for fulfillment.</li>
<li><b>Automatically-Collected Information:</b> We automatically collect certain information about you and the device with which you access the Website. For example, when you use the Website, we will log your IP address, operating system type, browser type, referring website, pages you viewed, and the dates/times when you accessed the Website. We may also collect information about actions you take when using the Website, such as links clicked. </li>
<li><b>Cookies:</b> We may log information using cookies, which are small data files stored on your browser by the Website. We may use both session cookies, which expire when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which stay on your browser until deleted, to provide you with a more personalized experience on the Website.</li>

<p>Different ways we collect information are detailed below. We reserve the right to change this list in our sole discretion. </p>

<h3>Our Use of Cookies</h3>

<p>A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.</p>

<p>We use cookies for the following purposes:<br>
(a) Authentication: We use cookies to identify you when you visit our website and as you navigate our website;<br>

<h3>Retargeting Ads</h3>

<p>From time to time, the Site may engage in remarketing efforts with third-party companies, such as Google, Facebook, or Instagram, in order to market the Site. These companies use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits to the Site. This means, after visiting the Site, you may see an ad for our services. However, your personally identifiable information is not used by any remarketing service other than to present you offers from the Site. We use the following third-party service providers for remarketing: </p>

<ul>
<li>Facebook: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217">Opt-out of Facebook remarketing here</a></li>

</ul>

<h3>Affiliate Program Participation</h3>

<p>The Site may engage in affiliate marketing, which is done by embedding tracking links into the Site. If you click on a link for an affiliate partnership, a cookie will be placed on your browser to track any sales for purposes of commissions.</p>

<p>Food Blogger Pro, LLC is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and links to Amazon.com. As part of this Amazon Associates program, the Site will post customized links, provided by Amazon, to track the referrals to their website. This program utilizes cookies to track visits for the purposes of assigning commission on these sales.</p>

<h3>Newsletters</h3>

<p>On the Site, you may subscribe to our newsletter, which may be used for advertising purposes. All newsletters sent may contain tracking pixels. The pixel is embedded in emails and allows an analysis of the success of online marketing campaigns. Because of these tracking pixels, we may see if and when you open an email and which links within the email you click. Also, this allows the Site to adapt the content of future newsletters to the interests of the user. This behavior will not be passed on to third parties</p>

<p><b>ANONYMOUS DATA</b></p>

<p>From time to time, we may use anonymous data, which does not identify you alone, or when combined with data from other parties. This type of anonymous data may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. Examples of this anonymous data may include analytics or information collected from cookies.</p>

<p><b>PUBLICLY VISIBLE INFORMATION</b></p>

<p>If you create a user profile on the Website or leave a comment, certain information may be publicly visible.</p>

<p><b>SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>

<p>At no time should you submit sensitive personal information to the Website. This includes your social security number, information regarding race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, health information, criminal background, or trade union memberships.
