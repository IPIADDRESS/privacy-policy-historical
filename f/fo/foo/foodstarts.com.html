<p>We may also offer various surveys on the site. If the survey is a news survey or about service satisfaction, we will not share that information. Certain other surveys and contests are promotional in nature, and are often sponsored by or hosted and run by our advertisers.</p>
<p>http://foodstarts.com/wp-admin/options-permalink.php</p>
<p>In such cases, we disclose that we collect and may share the information you provide to enter the contest or complete the survey with the advertiser.
