		This statement explains the online data collection and use practices of Foodlion.com; the statement and its description of our online data practices does not apply to other online sites or to other services provided by Food Lion, LLC, Delhaize America, Inc. or the Delhaize Group.  This statement does not apply to the offline data collection and use practices of Food Lion, LLC, Delhaize America, Inc. or the Delhaize Group, such as data collection in a Food Lion Store.  Please be aware that this privacy statement and the choices you make on this site will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided or will provide to Food Lion in other settings. 
		<br><br>
		Since Internet technologies continue to evolve and Internet business models are not fully established, this statement is subject to change.  Any changes to the privacy statement will be posted on this page and we will notify you of any material changes by placing a prominent notice on the home page of Foodlion.com.  We encourage you to periodically visit this page to stay informed about the data practices of Foodlion.com.  By using this site, you consent to the data practices described on this page and any updates.  
		<br><br>
		<b>The Information We Collect On This Site</b><br>
		Foodlion.com maintains and uses the anonymous, non-personal information collected in our server log files.  This information includes such anonymous data as number of visitors to the site, most popular pages, the user's operating system (for example, Macintosh or Windows), and user's browser type (for example, Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer).  We use this information to help us improve our website and enhance your viewing experience.  The server log files do not collect email addresses or other personally identifying information.  We do not tie this information to personal data and therefore it remains anonymous.
		<br><br>
		<b>Surveys</b><br>
		The information we gather from online surveys on the Foodlion.com site is for Foodlion.com use only. We generally do not request personally identifiable information such as name or email address in connection with our surveys.
