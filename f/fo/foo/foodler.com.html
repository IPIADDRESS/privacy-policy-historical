      <h2>Information Collection</h2>
<p>We collect information volunteered by consumers when they
register and place orders on our Web site. The information we
collect through registration and order placement is used to
provide the services specified on our Web site. We store
information such as page views, computer IP addresses and other
statistics in the form of logs. These logs are used solely to
enhance the technical performance of our Web site.</p>
<h2>Information Sharing</h2>
<p>In order to process your food order, we must share the
following information every time you place an order with a
restaurant: your name, e-mail address, delivery address, phone
number, food order and credit card information (if
applicable).</p>
<h2>Customer Communication</h2>
<p>Our customer service representatives may use your telephone number
or e-mail address to notify you of the status of your order as
necessary and appropriate. We do not share your information with any
third parties, except the local restaurant as stated above.</p>
<h2>E-mail</h2>
<p>We do not purchase bulk e-mail addresses nor do we use the services
of bulk e-mail companies for promoting our service. This means we will
not distribute, sell or rent your e-mail address to any third party
except local restaurants. Additionally, our e-mail servers do not
relay e-mail destined for non-local domains.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>We use "cookies" (small text files stored in your internet browser)

faster and more efficiently by storing information such as your email
address. We do not use cookies to track your surfing habits and
activities outside of our Web site. Cookies can be easily and safely
deleted from your system. See you browser's help section for
instructions.</p>
<h2>Security Information</h2>
<p>We always use industry standard encryption technologies, such as
256-bit SSL encryption, when transferring and receiving private
consumer data on our site. This information can only be translated
once it's received by our secure servers. These secure servers help to
protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we
have collected from you through our Web site.</p>
<h2>Policy Changes</h2>
<p>If our information practices change at some time in the future we
will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these
changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new
uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you
should periodically check this section of our Web site.</p>
