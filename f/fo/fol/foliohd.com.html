		<p class="lead-in">
			Your privacy is critically important to us. At Critical Axiom we have a few fundamental
			principles:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t
				stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent
				reason.)</li>
			<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with
				the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
			<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the
				on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
			<li>In our portfolio products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control
				what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently
				deleted.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Critical Axiom, LLC (“<strong>Critical Axiom</strong>”) operates several websites including
			<a href="http://foliohd.com/">foliohd.com</a>.
			It is Critical Axiom’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may
			collect while operating our websites.</p>
		<h3>
			Website Visitors</h3>
		<p>
			Like most website operators, Critical Axiom collects non-personally-identifying information
			of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
			browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
			visitor request. Critical Axiom’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
			information is to better understand how Critical Axiom’s visitors use its website.
			From time to time, Critical Axiom may release non-personally-identifying information
			in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
		<p>
			Critical Axiom also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
			Protocol (IP) addresses. Critical Axiom does not use such information to identify its
			visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the
			same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information,
			as described below.</p>
		<h3>
			Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
		<p>
			Certain visitors to Critical Axiom’s websites choose to interact with Critical Axiom in
			ways that require Critical Axiom to gather personally-identifying information. The amount
			and type of information that Critical Axiom gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
			Those who engage
			in transactions with Critical Axiom are asked to provide additional information, including
			as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.
			In each case, Critical Axiom collects such information only insofar as is necessary
			or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Critical Axiom.
			Critical Axiom does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
			below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information,
			with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
			activities.</p>
		<h3>
			Aggregated Statistics</h3>
		<p>
			Critical Axiom may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.
			For instance, Critical Axiom may monitor the most popular portfolios on the FolioHD.com
			site. Critical Axiom
			may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Critical Axiom
			does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
		<h3>
			Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
		<p>
			Critical Axiom discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
			information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations
			that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Critical Axiom’s behalf
			or to provide services available at Critical Axiom’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed
			not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
			organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Critical Axiom’s
			websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Critical Axiom will
			not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
			to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,
			as described above, Critical Axiom discloses potentially personally-identifying and
			personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Critical Axiom
			believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property
			or rights of Critical Axiom, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered
			user of an Critical Axiom website and have supplied your email address, Critical Axiom may
			occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback,
			or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Critical Axiom and our products.
			We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information,
			so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for
			example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the
			right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to
			help us support other users. Critical Axiom takes all measures reasonably necessary
			to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
			personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
		<h3>
			Cookies</h3>
		<p>
			A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer,
			and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
			Critical Axiom uses cookies to help Critical Axiom identify and track visitors, their usage
			of Critical Axiom website, and their website access preferences. Critical Axiom visitors
			who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers
			to refuse cookies before using Critical Axiom’s websites, with the drawback that certain
			features of Critical Axiom’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
		<h3>
			Ads</h3>
		<p>
			Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners,
			who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer
			each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you
			or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other
			things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest
			to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Critical Axiom and does not
			cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
		<h3>
			Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
		<p>
			Although most changes are likely to be minor, Critical Axiom may change its Privacy
			Policy from time to time, and in Critical Axiom’s sole discretion. Critical Axiom encourages
			visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If
			you have a FolioHD.com account, you should also check your portfolio’s dashboard for
			alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this
			Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
