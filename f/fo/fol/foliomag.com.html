						<h1>Red 7 Media Privacy Policy</h1>
					    <p>This Privacy Policy describes the online       information collection and use practices of the web sites operated by <strong> Red7Media</strong> and its divisions and       affiliates at       which this Privacy Policy is posted, which includes but is not limited to       the following web sites: FOLIOMAG.com, Circman.com, Eventmarketer.com,       Eventdesignmag.com, Folioshows.com, Foliosummit.com and Red7mediaâ€™s Events Online. </p>
					    <p>This Privacy Policy is current as of       October 1, 2005. If we make any substantive changes to this policy, we will       announce it on our web sites and, if you have provided us with contact       information, we will also send you a notice to the email or physical address       we have on file for you. If you have any questions or concerns regarding       this policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@red7media.com"> privacy@red7media.com</a>. Once       the changes have been made, your continued use of the site will constitute       your acceptance of the revised Policy. If you have questions regarding our       Privacy Policy, we may be reached via email at <a href="mailto:privacy@red7media.com"> privacy@red7media.com</a>, via fax       at 203-854-6730, or by writing to us at <strong> Red7Media</strong>; ATTN: SITE ADMINISTRATOR; 33 South Main St., Norwalk,       CT 06854.</p>
					    <p><strong>What information does      Red7Media collect and how is it used?</strong></p>
					    <p>Our sites collect information volunteered       by you in several areas, including newsletter sign up pages, site       registrations, and web site surveys. The information we request for you to       participate in these features may include personally identifiable       information such as name, address, telephone and fax numbers, and email       address, as well as "demographic" information such as your hobbies or       personal preferences. We will tell you at the time we collect information       whether the information requested is necessary for you to participate in a       particular feature. </p>
					    <p>The information we collect is used to       respond to your specific requests, to send you periodic information and       special offers from <strong>Red7Media</strong> and       our sponsors, to provide you with updates on <strong> Red7Media</strong> offerings and features, to provide you with product       information from manufacturers in our database, to provide notice of changes       to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, and to provide our sponsors with       aggregate data about our users. The information you provide is also used to       understand users' interests and behavior, and may be combined with       information <strong>Red7Media</strong> may have       from other online or offline sources.</p>
					    <p><strong>Red7Media</strong> uses cookies to identify registered web site users and to automatically give       them access to "member only" content areas such as articles and reports, and       to provide them with access to previously-stored information. <strong> Red7Media</strong> also uses cookies to       estimate our audience size and usage patterns and to track the aggregate       number of customer returns at our web site. Finally, <strong> Red7Media</strong> uses cookies to help       simplify the process of filling out certain forms on our web sites that       allow you to request information from manufactures in our catalog and/or our       advertisers. You can choose whether or not you accept cookies by changing       the settings of your browser. However, certain parts of our web sites may       not work if you turn off cookies on your browser. </p>
					    <p><strong>With whom does      Red7Media share your information?</strong></p>
					    <p><strong>Red7Media</strong> shares your information with its affiliates and business partners, including       agents such as third party mail processing facilities. We may employ       contractors to help with our operations. Some or all of these contractors       may access the databases of user information. These contractors are and will       be subject to confidentiality agreements that restrict their use and       disclosure of all information they obtain through their relationship with <strong> Red7Media</strong>. &nbsp;When sharing your       information with these third parties, <strong> Red7Media</strong> requires that the third parties follow practices       substantially similar to those of <strong>Red7Media</strong>,       and that your information not be further shared with any other third       parties. <strong>Red7Media</strong> will also share       your information if required by law to do so, to comply with applicable laws       or valid legal process, or to protect the rights or property of <strong> Red7Media</strong>. Additionally, if part or       some of our assets are purchased by a third party, <strong> Red7Media</strong> will share your information       with the purchaser of all or part of our assets.</p>
					    <p>If you use our "tell a friend" service to       email one of our articles, reports or product descriptions to a friend or       colleague, <strong>Red7Media</strong> will       automatically send this person a one-time email, attaching to the email the       content you wished for your friend to receive. Your email address will       appear on the "From" line of this email, thereby disclosing this information       to whoever opens and reads the email. The email address of you or your       friend or colleague will not be stored in our databases based on this       service. </p>
					    <p><strong>Red7Media</strong> may provide users with the opportunity to request additional information       from product manufacturers in our online directory or from our advertisers.       If you specifically request information from a manufacturer or from one of       our advertisers, your contact information will be given to that manufacturer       or advertiser, to allow them to decide the best way to fulfill your request.</p>
					    <p><strong>What options do you have about how       Red7Media uses or shares your information?</strong> </p>
					    <p>If you no longer wish for us to share your       mailing address or other contact information with our sponsors or other       third parties in whose products or services we believe you may be       interested, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:donotdisclose@red7media.com"> donotdisclose@red7media.com</a>. For us       to be able to locate your record, your email must include your name, mailing       address, email address, and must identify the Red7Media product, event, or       service for which you are registered. Your request will be processed within       10 days, and we will no longer share your contact information with third       parties. Please note that we will not be able to stop third parties from       sending you information about their products or services if your information       was shared with them before we received your request. </p>
					    <p>Regarding email specifically, you have the       opportunity to elect to stop receiving advertising messages from <strong> Red7Media </strong>about our products or       services each time you receive such a communication from us. To unsubscribe       from such advertising email messages, please follow the directions included       in that email message. Your request will be processed within 10 days. Please       note that during that time, you may continue to receive email messages from <strong>Red7Media</strong> about its products or       services. Additionally, regardless of whether you have unsubscribed from       receiving advertising and promotional material from <strong> Red7Media</strong>, you will continue to       receive transactional information from us, such as information relating to       your account or payment or bill information.</p>
					    <p>If you receive HW Offers, broadcast email       messages we send about third party manufacturers in whose products or       services we believe you may be interested, and no longer wish to receive       such messages, you can do so by following the directions included in the HW       Offer you receive. </p>
					    <p><strong>What Kind of Security Measures Does       Red7Media Use?</strong> </p>
					    <p>Information you provide to us is stored on       secure database servers. Any profile pages that display your personal data       is password-protected. We recommend that you do not share your passwords       with anyone. <strong>Red7Media</strong> will never ask you for your password in an       unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also, if you are using a       computer that others have access to, such as one in a computer lab, Internet       cafe or public library, always remember to log out and close your browser       window when leaving our site. </p>
					    <p><strong>Links to non-Red7Media       web sites</strong></p>
					    <p>Many of our web sites contain links to web       sites owned and operated by unaffiliated third parties. These links are       provided as a service to you, and do not constitute <strong>Red7Media</strong>'s endorsement or support of the third party web       sites. The third parties who operate these sites have their own information       collection and use practices, and <strong>Red7Media</strong> is not responsible for either the privacy practices or the content of these       sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of each site before       providing your personal information, and to contact the providers directly       if you have any questions about their privacy policies.</p>
