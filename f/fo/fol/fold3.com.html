<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Other Important Things for You to Understand When You Use Our Services</strong></p>

<p>You always maintain ownership of your DNA and DNA Data—you can manage and delete it as described in this Privacy Statement.</p>

<p>You may discover unexpected facts about yourself or your family when using our services. Once discoveries are made, we can’t undo them.</p>

<p>When you make new discoveries with us, you should feel confident and informed about how we use your Personal Information. Our full Privacy Statement is below and we encourage you to read it. It covers the following Ancestry and related brands: Ancestry®, <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/dna" target="_blank">AncestryDNA</a>®, <a href="https://www.fold3.com" target="_blank">Fold3</a>®, <a href="https://www.newspapers.com" target="_blank">Newspapers.com</a>™, <a href="https://www.archives.com" target="_blank">Archives</a>®, <a href="https://weremember.com/" target="_blank">We Remember</a>®, and <a href="https://www.findagrave.com" target="_blank">Find A Grave</a>®.</p>

<p><a name="Intro"></a><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</strong></p>

<p>At Ancestry, we empower journeys of personal discovery to enrich lives. As a result, we collect, process and store your Personal Information as you use our websites, mobile applications, and services (collectively the “<strong>Services</strong>”). Personal Information is information that can identify you, such as your name, email or street address, or it may be information that could reasonably be linked back to you, including your <a href="#GeneticInformation">Genetic Information</a>. This Privacy Statement describes our practices for collecting, storing and processing your Personal Information and the controls we provide you to manage it within our Services. In addition, we have a <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/cs/legal/AboutCookies" target="_blank">Cookie Policy</a> that describes our use of browser cookies and similar tracking technologies which is considered a part of this Privacy Statement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Account Creation and Your Engagement with Ancestry Services</strong></p>

<p>The Personal Information required to create an account with Ancestry is limited to your name, an email address, and a password. For Archives users only, billing information is also required for account creation.</p>

<p>Account creation also requires you to agree to the <a class="underline" href="https://www.ancestry.com/cs/legal/health-terms" target="_blank">Ancestry Terms and Conditions</a> and this Privacy Statement.</p>

<p>By creating an account you are telling us that you understand Ancestry will collect, process, and share your Personal Information (including your Genetic Information if you have taken the AncestryDNA test) as described in this Privacy Statement and in any other documents referenced in this Privacy Statement.</p>

<p>Access to Ancestry records to help you build a family tree, or to our DNA features (ethnicity estimate, etc.) requires additional personal information, including payment details, and, for the DNA test, the test code (when you activate your DNA test kit) and a saliva sample from which we can extract Genetic Information.</p>	

<p>At any time, you can request Ancestry delete information you have uploaded into your account, such as a family tree or your Genetic Information. You can also delete your entire account. Please see <a href="#Deletion">Section 10</a> for specific details about deleting your data.</p>

<p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;What are our retention practices?</strong></p>

<p>Ancestry Services are fundamentally premised on the notion that the personal voyage of self-discovery is not a one-time event and continues over lengthy periods of time—possibly lifetimes. Additionally, and with particular regard to our subscribers and DNA customers who pay fees or purchase subscriptions, the ongoing enhancement of our collections of historical records and DNA features provide benefits and insights to our Users over time. As a result, our retention practices reflect this ongoing value by retaining user accounts on our system until our Users inform us of their desire to delete their data or close their accounts.</p>

<p><strong>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Security</strong></p>

<p>Ancestry maintains a comprehensive information security program designed to protect our customers’ Personal Information using administrative, physical, and technical safeguards.</p>

<p>The specific security measures used are based on the sensitivity of the Personal Information collected. We have measures in place to protect against inappropriate access, loss, misuse, or alteration of Personal Information (including Genetic Information) under our control.</p>

<p>The Ancestry Security Team regularly reviews our security and privacy practices and enhances them as necessary to help ensure the integrity of our systems and your Personal Information.</p>

<p>We use secure server software to encrypt Personal Information (including Genetic Information), and we only partner with security companies that meet and commit to our security standards. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur, we use reasonable efforts to prevent this.</p>

<p>It is also important for you to guard against unauthorized access to your Personal Information by maintaining strong passwords and protecting against the unauthorized use of your own computer or device.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Transfer and Privacy Shield Notice</strong></p>

You have the right to withdraw consent at any time. Please note that your withdrawal of consent to collect and process your Personal Information will not affect the lawfulness of processing your Personal Information based on your consent before you withdrew your consent.</p>

For example, we process your credit card details when you provide them in order to use our Services or purchase access to premium features such as our DNA testing services.</p>

You can also access Ancestry’s Privacy Center for additional details on Ancestry’s privacy practices <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/cs/privacyphilosophy" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;What information does Ancestry collect through your use of the AncestryHealth Service?</strong></p>

<p>We collect the following information from you to provide the AncestryHealth® Service, which includes Health Activation Information, Your Health History, Family Health History and DNA Data, as defined below. This information, along with other information specified in the Ancestry Privacy Statement, is collectively referred to here as your “Personal Information”.</p>

<p><strong>Health Activation Information</strong></p>

	<li>Tube code</li>
	<li>Name</li>
	<li>Full Date of Birth</li>
	<li>Biological sex</li>
	<li>Street Address</li>
	<li>Phone number</li>

	<li>Whether you are a stem cell or bone marrow transplant recipient</li>
	<li>Information about current and past health history of you and your family, such as doctor diagnosed conditions, carrier status, and lifestyle choices that may have an impact on your health (“<strong>Your Health History</strong>”)</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<p><strong>Family Health History</strong></p>

<p>We collect personal and health history information about your family members (“<strong>Family Health History</strong>”) which you have voluntarily contributed to your AncestryHealth® account. The information collected may include:</p>
	
	<ul class="bulleted">
		<li>Relationship</li>

		<li>Condition(s)</li>
		<li>Age of diagnosis</li>
		<li>Additional notes provided by user</li>
	</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;How does Ancestry use your Personal Information?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Health Activation Information</strong></p>

<p>Ancestry uses your Health Activation Information to:</p>

<ul class="bulleted">
	<li>Support and facilitate
	<ul class="bulleted">
		<li>the determination of eligibility for the AncestryHealth® Service; and</li>
		<li>the patient-physician relationship with the independent physician network, which is provided as part of the AncestryHealth® Service.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Process your AncestryHealth® kit and deliver personalized health reports to you.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Your Health History</strong></p>

<p>Ancestry uses Your Health History information to:</p>

<ul class="bulleted">
	<li>Provide information to the independent physician network so they may determine your eligibility for the test(s), and identify possible health issues or factors which may impact the results of your test; and</li>
	<li>Deliver a personalized experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ancestry may also use Your Health History information in a de-identified format to improve, update and expand the AncestryHealth® Service.</p>

<p><strong>Family Health History</strong></p>

<p>Ancestry may use your Family Health History information to deliver a personalized experience. Ancestry may also use your Family Health History information in a de-identified format to improve our AncestryHealth® Service and identify new product offerings.</p>

<p><strong>Genetic Information and Health Reports</strong></p>

<p>If the independent physician network partner approves your laboratory test, and, depending on which AncestryHealth® product you buy and whether we have your DNA Data from prior testing, Ancestry will either share your DNA Data, or send your sample for processing to our independent laboratory partner. Using your DNA Data, our independent laboratory partner will generate a test result, which Ancestry, in turn, will use to provide your health report.</p>

<p>Ancestry's independent physician network will also have access to your test result and health report.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> As addressed in our Privacy Statement, Ancestry commits not to share any Personal Information of AncestryHealth® Users with insurance companies, employers, or third party marketers. Ancestry does not voluntarily cooperate with law enforcement. To provide our Users with the greatest protection under the law, we require all government agencies seeking access to Ancestry customers’ data to follow valid legal process and do not allow law enforcement to use Ancestry’s services to investigate crimes or to identify human remains.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;When do we share your information and who are the recipients?</strong></p>

<p>Ancestry will share your Health Activation Information, Your Health History, test results, health report, and any questions you submit through the “Submit a Question” feature with the independent physician network who has been appointed as part of the AncestryHealth® Service. The independent physician network will use this information to determine your eligibility for the test, to review and provide oversight of the health reports, as well as to assist in providing genetic counseling services to you.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The use of your information by the independent physician network, PWNHealth, will be subject to their <a href="http://ancestry-csc.pwnhealth.com/terms-of-use" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="http://ancestry-csc.pwnhealth.com/privacy" target="_blank">Notice of Privacy Practices</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Choices and Access to your Personal Information?</strong></p>

<p>You may access your AncestryHealth® Core or Plus test results and reports at any time, through the AncestryHealth® product. You may also download your DNA data obtained from the micro-array technology used to provide you AncestryHealth® test results free of charge from your DNA test settings page. If you are a AncestryHealth® Plus customer, there may be additional charges to download your full next generation sequencing (NGS) DNA Data once the download feature becomes available.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;What are Ancestry’s retention practices for the AncestryHealth® Service?</strong></p>

<p>Ancestry will retain the Personal Information you provided to the AncestryHealth® Service until you tell us to delete it. This is to ensure that you always have access to your test results, health reports, and to the physician network service which is included as part of the AncestryHealth® Service. In addition, if you have purchased the AncestryHealth® subscription, you will be entitled to receive results to new tests as they become available, and Ancestry will need access to your Personal Information in order to provide this service.</p>

<p>Please note that our laboratory partners are required to retain your data for a period of at least ten (10) years, or as required by state law and the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Act (CLIA) and the guildelines that apply to laboratories certified by the College of American Pathologists (CAP). The independent physician network will retain your Personal Information as required by applicable laws and regulations and subject to their Terms of Use and Notice of Privacy Practices.</p>
