<p class="title"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p class="maintext">FriendsHangout.com is committed to respecting and protecting the 
privacy of those who use FriendsHangout.com. This statement outlines how we handle 
any personal information we obtain.</p>
<p class="maintext">From time to time, we may ask for information that personally 
identifies you, as in user surveys or orders placed through our site. We use 
this information to operate this site, provide you with the highest quality 
services and offer you opportunities we think will be of interest.</p>
<p class="maintext">You also may choose to provide personal information by 
participating in various forums we intend to offer for readers. You should 
remember that when you yourself voluntarily disclose personal information to 
other Internet users, such as when you include personal information in a posting 
to an online discussion forum, that information could be used by others and may 
result in unsolicited messages or other forms of attention.</p>
<p class="maintext">We use IP addresses to analyze traffic and administer this 
site. IP addresses track individual computers and do not contain personally 
identifiable data. </p>
<p class="maintext">In order to describe our services to prospective partners, 
advertisers and others, we may disclose user information, but only in a form 
that does not identify individual users. For example, we might disclose that a 
certain percentage of our users are from US households or within a certain age 
range. </p> 
<p class="title"><strong>Privacy of Minors</strong></p>
<p class="maintext">
We are committed to comply with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”). 
COPPA defines a "Child" as anyone under the age of 13. Children are not eligible to use the site unsupervised. If you are 
under the age of 13, you may only use this site in conjunction with and under the supervision of your parents or guardians. 
Internet safety experts have advised that children do not fully appreciate the risk of providing too much personal information 
online or communicating with strangers they encounter online.
