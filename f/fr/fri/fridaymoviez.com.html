Your IP address is used in diagnosing problems with our server and administering our website and services. Through our surveys, subscriptions, and registrations, we request users to give us contact, demographic and/or financial information (like name, locale, gender, age, income level and email address) so that we could enhance our user experience by being more content specific. The contact information is used to notify users of new services and content, as well as for surveys and newsletters. Our site may use an order form for customers to subscribe to our for-pay services. We collect contact information (like e-mail address) and financial information (like account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send billing invoices.
</p>
 <br>
<p>
Contact information is also used to get in touch with the subscribers when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future communications by unsubscribing. Financial information that is collected is used, among other things, to bill the user for products and services for in-house statistics, advertising, and marketing target information. We do not share personal financial information with any other parties without your consent. Information collected during registration is used for in-house statistics and marketing target information. This site contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites or any website from which you may have linked to us. We are committed to protecting your privacy online. We collect certain personal information in order to provide you with customized services, content, and advertisements. We may disclose to third parties certain aggregate information only when such action is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, legal process, or to enforce the terms of service.
</p>
 <br>
<p>
We will also use your personal information for the purposes of providing you with any services to which you subscribe, service-related activities and notifying you or contacting you regarding any problem with, or the expiration of, such services. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.
