<h1>FriendFeed Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><i>Last updated: September 26, 2008</i></p>
<p>FriendFeed takes your privacy seriously. We respect and protect the privacy of our users and take appropriate steps to safeguard your personal information. This privacy policy (the “Policy”) explains the types of personal information that we receive and collect when you use the FriendFeed website ("Site") or the services offered by FriendFeed ("Services").</p>
<p>Because FriendFeed is intended for users to share information, photos, ideas, etc. with their friends, it is important to distinguish between what we will share with third
parties, and what users are themselves sharing on the Site. We do not generally
restrict what you share with your friends on the Site, and you are solely
responsible for the content and privacy of what you share. FriendFeed, however, does not sell personal
information to third parties at any time for any reason. The information we
collect, as described below, is used solely to facilitate the delivery to you of
our Services. Despite our policy against the sale or use of personal
information of users other than for the purpose of delivering the Services, users
should be aware that what they share on the Site may be discovered by third
parties without the involvement of FriendFeed, including, without limitation,
search engine crawlers, bots and the like. Users should always take that into
consideration whenever they share something, whether on our Site or on other
third-party sites.</p>
<p>FriendFeed adheres
to the US safe harbor privacy
principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access
and Enforcement, and is registered with the <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">U.S. Department of Commerce's safe
harbor program</a>.</p>
<p>If you
have any questions about this Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@friendfeed.com">privacy@friendfeed.com</a>, or write to us
at FriendFeed Inc., 313 W. Evelyn
Ave., Mountain View, CA 94041.
</p>
<h3>Information we collect</h3>
<h4>Information you provide</h4>
<ul>
<li>When you sign up for a
FriendFeed account, we ask you for personal information, such as your
name, email address, and a nickname. You'll be asked to create a password
for your FriendFeed account. You may also provide us with additional email
addresses that we will link with your account.</li><li>You may create a public
profile that includes certain personal information and pictures, which can
be accessed and viewed by other FriendFeed users.</li><li>If you choose to have
FriendFeed aggregate your activity from other websites, you must provide
us with your username for each site. You should be aware that for certain
sites, this may expose your email credentials. For some sites, we will ask
for a password if it is required by that service to display the
information on FriendFeed.</li><li>When you provide friends'
email addresses and the services they use, we store these in order to
provide Services to you. We also store your imported contact list if you
choose.</li><li>When you invite friends to FriendFeed
or send messages through FriendFeed, we collect and maintain information
associated with those messages, including email addresses and content.</li></ul>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>A cookie is a
small file containing a string of characters. This information is sent to your
computer when you use FriendFeed, and it’s stored on your computer so that we
can uniquely identify a user’s browser. We use cookies to store user
preferences and track user trends. Because FriendFeed is entirely personalized,
your browser must accept cookies for us to provide our Services to you.</p>
<h4>Contents of entries</h4>
<p>The contents of any entry that you post directly to the Site, as well as any text, images, photos, videos and audio, are stored and maintained on our servers in order to publish these items and provide the Service. Your submitted content will be associated with your account.</p>
<h4>User communications</h4>
<p>When you send email or other communication to FriendFeed, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.</p>
<h4>Non-personally-identifying information</h4>
<p>This is information that is commonly made available by web browsers and servers, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. FriendFeed uses this information to better understand how visitors use our website. From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in FriendFeed usage.</p>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>We
maintain and process your personal information in order to provide your
FriendFeed account and access. When you send messages or invitations through
FriendFeed, your name, email address and personal FriendFeed URL are identified
in the message. We also use your name and email address to notify you of
FriendFeed updates that you have selected for in “Settings”, as well as other
information, such as friend subscription requests.</p>
<p>We store
passwords for third-party services if it is required by that service to display
the information on FriendFeed. We do this in order to provide Services to you.
We do not store passwords for third-party sites when you provide them as part
of contact information retrieval, such as contacts import from Gmail.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, FriendFeed may process personal information for such purposes as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending you information
related to your FriendFeed account or other FriendFeed services;</li>
<li>Auditing, research and
analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;</li>
<li>Ensuring the technical
functioning of our network; and</li>
<li>Developing new services.</li>
</ul>
<p>FriendFeed
processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America. For users
outside the United States,
please note that any personally-identifying information you enter into the Site
will be transferred out of your country and into the United States. You consent to such
transfer through your use of the Site and our Services. You also warrant that
you have the right to transfer such information outside your country and into
the United States.</p>
<h3>Choices for personal information</h3>
<p>You may
change your FriendFeed account settings in the FriendFeed “Settings” section.
You may delete your entries through FriendFeed, and this will take immediate
effect in your account view. Residual copies of deleted entries remain in our database
to keep them from accidentally reappearing in people's feeds. When an entry is
deleted in FriendFeed, it often is not deleted in the third-party site from
which that entry came. FriendFeed retains the original entry so that it is not
added as a "new" item during a future crawl.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to terminate your FriendFeed account, you can do so at: <a href="/account/delete">http://friendfeed.com/account/delete</a>. You can also write to us at FriendFeed Inc., 313 W. Evelyn Ave., Mountain View, CA 94041. If you terminate your account, your profile and any entries or comments you’ve made will be removed from the site. Your account will be deleted immediately, but it will remain in our backup systems.</p>
<p>You can decline to submit personal information to our Service, in which case FriendFeed may not be able to provide the Service to you.</p>
<h3>Information sharing</h3>
<p>In
addition to the uses noted above, FriendFeed only shares personal information with
other companies or individuals outside of FriendFeed in the following limited
circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have your consent. We
require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal
information.</li><li>We have a good faith belief
that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is
reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal
process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable <a href="terms">Terms of Service</a>, including
investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or
otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect
against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of FriendFeed, its
users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li></ul>
<p>If
FriendFeed becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of
some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information
is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p>Please contact
us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or
use of personal data.</p>
<h3>Information security</h3>
<p>We take
appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or
unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include
internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and
security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against
unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.</p>
<p>We restrict
access to personal information to FriendFeed employees, contractors and agents
who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our
services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be
subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they
fail to meet these obligations.</p>
<h3>Data integrity</h3>
<p>FriendFeed
processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected
and in accordance with this Policy. We review our data collection, storage and
processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the
personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take
reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is
accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or
correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p>
<h3>Accessing and updating personal information</h3>
<p>When you
use FriendFeed, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your
personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to
delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained
by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify
themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed
before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that
are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical
effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical
(for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or
for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide
information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge,
except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.</p>
<h3>Links to Third Party Sites</h3>
<p>This
Policy only applies to the FriendFeed website and services. We do not exercise
control over the sites that our service links to. These other sites may place
their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit
personal information from you. We encourage you to read such privacy policies
of any third-party sites you visit. It is the sole responsibility of such third
parties to adhere to any applicable restrictions on the disclosure of your
personally-identifying information, and FriendFeed and its affiliates shall not
be liable for wrongful use or disclosure of your personally-identifying
information by any third party.</p>
<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>FriendFeed
regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy. Please feel free to direct
any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or FriendFeed’s treatment of
personal information by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@friendfeed.com">privacy@friendfeed.com</a>
or by writing to us at the address below. When we receive formal written
complaints at this address, it is FriendFeed's policy to contact the
complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the
appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection
authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data
that cannot be resolved between FriendFeed and an individual.</p>
<h3>Changes to this policy</h3>
<p>This
Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this
Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be
minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the
changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. Each version
of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date,
and we will also keep prior versions of this Policy in an archive for your
review.</p>
<p>If you
have any additional questions or concerns about this Policy, please contact us
at <a href="mailto:privacy@friendfeed.com">privacy@friendfeed.com</a>, or write
to us at FriendFeed Inc., 313 W.
Evelyn Ave., Mountain View, CA 94041.
