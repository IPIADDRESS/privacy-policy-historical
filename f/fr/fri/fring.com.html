<p class="topp">Introduction</p>
<p class="myp">We are committed to respecting your online privacy and 
recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally 
identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us. 
<br><br>
Personal Information means any information that may be used to 
identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, 
personal profile, a home or other physical address and an email address or other 
contact information.<br><br>
In order to provide you with the services given under the 
Site, you must provide us with your telephone number that will be used by us as 
your User ID for the Site and we will send via SMS to such telephone number the 
software that you download from the Site. In order to download from the Site or 
to provide other services we may request additional Personal Information such as 
your name&nbsp; the country that you are resident in, your email address (which 
will be used for the purpose of resolving password problems) or other items.<br><br>
If you would like to receive any email notifications or 
updates from us regarding support services, as well as goods and services which 
may be of interest to you, please register to create a profile and provide your 
email address. At a later time, you may add additional Personal Information to 
your profile. <br><br>
When you use fring’s software, we may record information about 
your usage, such as when you use the fring software, the size of your contact 
list and the contacts you communicate with, and the frequency and size of data 
transfers. Information displayed or clicked on in the fring software interface 
(including UI elements, settings, and other information) is also recorded.<br><br>
We may transfer that Personal Information within fring or to 
fring's third-party service providers and business partners, but only to provide 
services on the Site or to you, across borders, and from your country or 
jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.

best possible service to you, such as improving the fring software user 
interface and maintaining a consistent and reliable user experience.<br><br>

with your account. <br><br>
When you use fring software, people included in your contact 
list may be able to see your online presence, username, and any information that 
you choose to add to your profile, including images, links, and custom status 
indicators. Users may choose to present them as being unavailable.<br><br>
We may relay content for users in some cases. &nbsp;</p>

browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them 
and how to remove them.<br><br>

cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note
