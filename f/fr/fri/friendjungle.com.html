By using the Website in any way, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, whether or not you register as a member to the Service. We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. Notification of changes in this Privacy Policy will be posted on the Website or sent via electronic mail, as we may determine in our sole discretion. Your continued use of the Service will constitute a binding acceptance by you of this Privacy Policy, or any subsequent modifications.</p><h4>Overview</h4><p>As part of the normal operation of our services we collect information about you in order to offer the highest possibility of finding a partner through our site.  As a matter of policy, we do not sell, rent, or give any personally identifiable information about you to any third party; <strong>except for in cases where our terms and conditions may have
                                    been broken.</strong></p><h4>Information you supply</h4><p>If you have started, but not completed, the registration process, we may send you email messages encouraging you to complete the process and become a subscriber. Once you complete the registration process, we may also occasionally send you newsletters and email you notifications of special events or information on users that are establishing contact with you through our site. If you would rather not receive emails about new products, promotions or other noteworthy news, you may opt-out by visiting the "Settings" section. We further offer a subscriber-based service to users seeking partners. To process subscriptions we may require your name, billing address, phone number, email address and credit card information. Credit card transactions are processed through a third party billing company, which only uses your information for that purpose. In the event that we are acquired by another company, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party. If this occurs, you will be notified if there are any material changes to the way your personally identifiable information is collected or used.</p><h4>Information collected automatically</h4><p>We automatically collect information, provided by your browser, when you visit our website.

These uses improve our Websites and help us better meet your needs as a user.</p><h4>Disclosure</h4><p>As a matter of policy, we do not sell, rent, or give any personally identifiable information about you to any third party; <strong>except for in cases where our terms and conditions may have been broken.</strong> All personally identifiable data is accessible solely to authorized employees, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. However, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed. By way of example (without limiting any of the foregoing), we may be required to disclose information to the government, law enforcement agencies or third parties. Under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or members may abuse or misuse your information that they collect from our Websites. Accordingly, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private. That being said, we want you to feel confident using our website. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.

Under no circumstances may you disclose personally identifiable information about another member to any third party without our consent and the consent of such other member after adequate disclosure.</p><h4>Age Restriction</h4><p>You must be 18 years of age or over to register as a member of or be permitted use of the Website. Any information we receive from people we believe to be under the age of 18 will be purged from our database.
