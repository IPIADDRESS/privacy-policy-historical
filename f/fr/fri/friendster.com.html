<h4>About Friendster and the Information We Collect</h4>
<p>
        Friendster is an online social networking community that connects
        people through networks of friends for dating or making new friends.
        To accomplish this, our users create their own profiles which are shown
        to the people in their personal network.  A personal network consists
        of a user's friends as well as the extended group of people that a user
        is connected to via chains of mutual friends.  To fulfill the purpose
        of this site, some personal information we ask for is displayed to
        people within these personal networks.
      </p>
<h4>Information Collected/Tracked by Friendster</h4>
<h6 class="smalltopbottommargin small">
        Information submitted to Friendster
      </h6>
<p>
        Friendster collects user-submitted account information such as name
        and email address to identify users and send notifications related
        to the use of the service.  Friendster also collects user-submitted
        profile information such as gender, age, occupation, location, etc.
      </p>
<h6 class="smalltopbottommargin small">
        Information not Directly Submitted by Users to Friendster
      </h6>
<p>
        This is information we collect that is not personally identifiable,
        such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered
        for all users to the site.
      </p>
<h4>Use of Information Obtained by Friendster</h4>
<h6 class="smalltopbottommargin small">
        Information users submit to Friendster
      </h6>
<p>
        Profile information as well as first name and photos are displayed to
        people in a user's personal network, to support the function of the
        site as social networking community where users can meet new people
        through their friends.  Email address and full name are used when a
        user invites a friend via email to join the service, when a user
        requests to add another user to their friend list, and when we send
        notifications to a user related to their use of the service. Except
        when inviting or adding friends, a user's email address is not shared
        or displayed with people within a user's personal network.  Users
        within a personal network communicate on Friendster with each other
        through the Friendster service, without disclosing email addresses. We
        may also use a user's email address to send weekly updates or news
        regarding our site, but the user may choose not to receive email of
        this type by accessing their Account Info.
      </p>
<h6 class="smalltopbottommargin small">
        Information that users do not submit to us
      </h6>
<p>
        We use your server, IP address, and browser-type related information
        in the general administration of our website.
      </p>
<h4>Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</h4>
<p>
        As a matter of policy, except where you are expressly informed
        otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your
        personal information unless required by law or for the protection of
        your membership.  However, Friendster may share profile information and
        aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable manner to
        advertisers and other third parties in order to present to members more
        targeted advertising, products and services. In such situations we will
        never disclose information that will be used to personally identify you.
      </p>
<h4>Links</h4>
<p>
        This site may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that
        Friendster is not responsible for the privacy practices of other Web
        sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and
        to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects
        personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies
        solely to information collected by this Web site.
      </p>
<h4>Use of Cookies</h4>
<p>
        A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to
        information about the user.  We use both session ID cookies and
        persistent cookies.  For the session ID cookie, once users close the
        browser, the cookie simply terminates.  A persistent cookie is a small
        text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of
        time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser
        help file directions.  Cookies are used to manage sessions on our site.
        Users must enable cookies to use our site.  Also, users may optionally
        use a cookie to remember their password in order to automatically log
        in to our site.  We do not and will not use cookies to collect private
        information from any user which they did not intentionally submit to us.
      </p>
<h4>Correcting/Updating or Removing Information</h4>
<p>
        Friendster users may modify or remove any of their personal information
        at any time by logging into their account and accessing features such
        as Edit Profile and Account Info.
      </p>
<h4>Changes in Our Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>
        If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our web
        site so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how
        we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we
        are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner
        different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify
        users via email or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
      </p>
<h4>Invite a Friend</h4>
<p>
        If a user elects to use our Invite feature to invite a friend to our
        site, we ask them for the friend's email address.  Friendster will
        automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the site.
        Friendster stores this email address for the purpose of automatically
        adding the respondent to the friends list of the user sending the
        invitation, and also to send reminders of the invitation.  Friendster
        does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other
        communication besides invitations and invitation reminders.  The friend
        may <a class="biglink" href="/info/contacts.php">contact Friendster</a>
        to request the removal of this information from our database.
      </p>
<h4>Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums</h4>
<p>
        Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal
        information online for example on message boards, through e-mail, or
        in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others.
        In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly
        accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in
        return.
      </p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>
        Your Friendster account is password-protected. This web site takes
        every precaution to protect our users' information. We use industry
        standard measures to protect your information that is stored within
        our database. We limit the access to your information to those
        employees who need access to perform their job function such as our
        customer service personnel. If you have any questions about the
        security at our website, please 
        <a class="biglink" href="/info/contacts.php">contact us</a>.
      </p>
<h4>Email Choice/Opt-out</h4>
<p>
        Users who no longer wish to receive our weekly updates or news may
        opt-out of receiving these communications by following the instructions
        contained in the email or by logging-in and changing their settings in
        the Account Info section of the site.
      </p>
<h4>Third Party Advertising</h4>
<p>
        The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by our Web
        advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may set cookies.
        Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time
        they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may
        compile information about where you, or others who are using your
        computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked
        on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted
        advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
        Friendster  does not have access to or control of the cookies that may
        be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.
      </p>
<p>
        This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Friendster and
        does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
