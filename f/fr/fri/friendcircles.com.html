<p>We at&nbsp;<strong>FriendCircles.com</strong>&nbsp;("<strong>FriendCircles.com</strong>" a.k.a. "The Circle of Friends Network") have created this&nbsp;<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>&nbsp;for the protection of its Members ("Friendizens").&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy outlines the policy purpose, audience and parameters in which personal privacy is protected.&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;<strong><em>Privacy Policy</em></strong>&nbsp;only applies to transactions and activities within the online services in which Members subscribe.&nbsp;&nbsp;Online services to be all inclusive of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FriendCircles</strong><strong>Website</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>FriendCircles.com</strong>&nbsp;Network Partner sites&nbsp; (collectively, the "<strong>Site</strong>") but does not apply to any other Website or offline point of contact between&nbsp;<strong>FriendCircles.com</strong>&nbsp;or any other company, and consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;We reserve the right to modify this&nbsp;<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>&nbsp;periodically.&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>&nbsp;was last revised on December, 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time you visit the internet site, use the online services or provide us with information, you are accepting the practices described in this&nbsp;<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>&nbsp;at that time.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>YOUR IP ADDRESS</strong></p>
<p>Like most e-commerce internet sites, each time you visit the site,&nbsp;<strong>FriendCircles.com</strong>&nbsp;captures and stores origination information.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to administer and optimize the site and perform diagnostics with the site,&nbsp;<strong>FriendCircles.com</strong>uses origination IP addresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Origination data is also used to manage demographic data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>COOKIES</strong></p>
<p>Similar to other internet sites, this site uses cookies to keep track of activities, purchases and other online transactions on this site and to enhance user experience for online transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies are also used to deliver content specific of user interests, save and store passwords, and cookies can store personal and financial information so to prevent multiple entries containing the same data.&nbsp;&nbsp;Third party advertisers on the internet site may also place or read cookies on the user’s browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wish to disable these cookies, the "<strong><em>Help</em></strong>" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will instruct the user to modify settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, browser modifications may inhibit access to links and other online services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><strong>CHILDREN</strong><br><br>In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will not knowingly provide access to FriendCircles to persons under the age of thirteen (13). If FriendCircles later learns that a member is under the age of thirteen (13) we will take appropriate steps to remove the member's information from the database and restrict the individual from future access to the FriendCircles service.<br>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>COLLECTED INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>In customizing online services to meet user and Member demands, we may collect "personal information" (i.e. information that could be used to contact you directly (without using the site) such as full name, postal address, phone number or email address), "financial information" (i.e. credit card numbers or passwords) or "demographic information" (i.e. information submitted or collected that is neither personal information nor financial information; this may include, but is not limited to, zip code, postal code, hometown, marital status, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, username, age/birth date, purchase history information, browsing history information, searching history information, registration history information, and the content of communications between individual Members and other Members over the site), subject to the rest of this paragraph.</p>
<p>Demographic information is divided into two categories: 1) "non-public information", which consists of purchase history information and one-on-one communications between Members and other users of the Site; and 2) "public information", which consists of all other demographic information.&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal information or financial information should not be entered into the user “Profile” (for example, do not use your address or pass code as your username, or include your name or address in written responses).&nbsp;&nbsp;If this info is used, that information may likely be considered "demographic information" that is "public information."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
