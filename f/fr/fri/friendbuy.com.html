	  <h1>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h1>

	  <h2>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h2>

	  <p>As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience for all recipients of Friendbuy
	  advertising, we may use log files, web beacons and cookies (defined below) to collect and store data from
	  browsers, advertiser and third party sites ("Sites") to aggregate Information. The Information collected is
	  used for marketing purposes, enables us to determine which advertisements perform well, allows us to more
	  effectively match advertisements and website content to your interests, if necessary, assists us in improving
	  the operation of our services, helps us to maintain the quality of our services, enhances our services to our
	  business partners and clients and enables us to provide general statistics to our business partners and
	  clients regarding use of Friendbuy's services.</p>

	  <p>"Log files" store tracked actions occurring on Sites and collect data including your IP address, browser
	  type, referring url, request url, user agent, browser accept language, platform type, and date/time stamp (for
	  clicks and sales/leads only), which make up click, impression, and sales/lead data, advertisements viewed, and
	  any other data that comes from interaction with Friendbuy's network.</p>

	  <p>"Web beacons" are objects that are embedded in a web page or e-mail and are usually invisible to the user
	  but are used to track a web user's navigation of a website or collection of websites or pages, interaction
	  with an e-mail, the completion of transactions, submittal of applications and browsing behavior.</p>

	  <p>"Cookies" are files (e.g. flash browser objects or http header) that are stored on your web-enabled client
	  (such as your web browser). There are many misconceptions about Cookies, some of which we will try to address
	  in this policy. Cookies cannot erase your hard drive or otherwise damage your computer and do not tell us an
	  e-mail address or any other PII. Friendbuy does not and cannot use Cookies or web beacons to retrieve PII from
	  your computer. Cookies are used to improve the experience web users have when they see web
	  advertisements. When a consumer responds to or views an Internet advertisement served by Friendbuy (such as
	  through third-party Web sites or email solicitation) or visits a Friendbuy Network site, we send a Cookie
	  and/or gif file to assign an anonymous, unique identifier to the end user's Internet browser. One function of
	  these Cookies is to provide Friendbuy with information for the purpose of paying third-parties commissions
	  when an Internet user clicks on a link, creates a lead, or makes a purchase on an Retailer's Web site. If the
	  Internet user re-visits the Retailer's site directly, Friendbuy is able to continue to track the user's
	  activities (excluding PII) on the Retailer's site and reward the third-party Web site that referred the
	  user. We may use Cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of
	  display. This allows advertisers to determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they
	  reach. Cookies may also be used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser, and to
	  limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement. We also may use Internet browsing and
	  online purchase data associated with an anonymous identifier to develop a predictive statistical user profile
	  of the end user's needs and interests. We reserve the right to retain all ad delivery and reporting data as
	  long as may be reasonably necessary for accounting and audit purposes.</p>

	  <p>There are two classes of Cookies based on how long they remain on an internet enabled device: (i) "Session
	  Cookies," which are used only during a web user's visit to a website or web page and are erased once such user
	  closes the browser, and (ii) "Persistent Cookies," which remain on a web user's browser for no more than 5
	  years from a user's last interaction with an advertisement.</p>

	  at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

	  <h1>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION</h1>

	  <h2>Information Shared by Friendbuy</h2>
	  
	  <p>Friendbuy will only share your Information for the limited purposes provided for in this Privacy
	  Policy. This may include sharing Information (1) to enable third party service providers to assist or
	  facilitate in the services we provide to our clients; (2) to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to
	  respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information received by us, whether or not a
	  response is required by applicable law; (3) to enforce our terms of use and other agreements or to protect our
	  rights; (4) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service; (5) third party marketing
	  partners (including retailers and publishers) for marketing purposes; (6) with vendors, administrative service
	  providers, technology providers, and carefully selected partners for data validation, enhancement, information
	  verification and suppression services; or (7) for any other purpose for which you provide consent. We may
	  share Information with other third parties for marketing purposes and online behavioral advertising, but such
	  Information does not include PII; provided, however, such retailers, publishers and other third parties may
	  combine such Information with any PII that you may choose to give in registering and transacting with their
	  websites and other platforms, and such information and PII may be sent through Friendbuy to the relevant
	  retailers, publishers and other third parties. With respect to online behavioral advertising, we and other
	  third parties may use non-personally identifiable information collected or shared with respect to your visits
	  to websites we have relationships with for various purposes, including, but not limited to providing
	  advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. Typically a cookie or third
	  party web beacon is used to collect this information.  While Friendbuy chooses its business partners and
	  clients carefully and strongly encourages them to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, Friendbuy
	  is not responsible for the information and privacy practices of such third parties. The collection, use, and
	  disclosure of information by clients and partners are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may
	  differ from this Privacy Policy. You should check the applicable privacy policies of these third parties to
	  determine how they handle any information they receive.</p>

	  <p>In the event that Friendbuy is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in
	  any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from you as part of such
	  merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency,
	  reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or
	  equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your Information
	  is treated, transferred, or used.</p>

	  <h2>Information Collected by Third Party Sites</h2>

	  <p>Please be aware that the websites of our retailers and publisher clients as well as the websites on which
	  we place advertisements or any third party websites linked to one of our sites also may collect information
	  from you for various purposes, including, but not limited to providing advertisements about goods and services
	  likely to be of greater interest to you. Such information may include non-personally identifiable information
	  through the use of Cookies and other technology and any personally identifiable information you may choose to
	  give in registering and transacting with such website. These companies typically use a cookie or third party
	  web beacon to collect this information.  Although we choose our business partners and clients carefully,
	  Friendbuy is not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. You should check the applicable
	  privacy policies of such third parties to determine how they handle any information they collect from you.</p>

	  <h1>YOUR CHOICES</h1>

	  <p>You will have the option of blocking the use of Cookies by changing a setting in your Internet
	  browser. Please see your browser supplier's Web site for details on how to do this.</p>

	  <h1>PROCESSING AND STORING YOUR DATA</h1>

	  <h2>Data Processing</h2>

	  <p>By providing information to us, you acknowledge that we operate in the US and you agree to (i) permit us to
	  transmit and use your user Information anywhere necessary, including across international boundaries, to
	  better improve the services and transactions provided by Friendbuy; and (ii) that such use by us shall be
	  subject to the terms and conditions stated in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.</p>

	  <h2>Security</h2>
	  
	  <p>Friendbuy employs appropriate measures to ensure the security of all Information, and we routinely evaluate
	  our practices to identify security threats or opportunities for the improvement of our services. No
	  transmission of information is guaranteed to be completely secure. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or
	  software failure, and other factors may compromise data security. You acknowledge and agree to assume this
	  risk when communicating with us.</p>

	  <h1>CHANGES</h1>

	  <p>As the standards governing Internet privacy continue to evolve, Friendbuy may find it appropriate or
	  necessary to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. As a result, we reserve the right to change this
	  Privacy Policy at any time and shall post such changes on the Website. Our Website will state the date the
	  Privacy Policy was last updated. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you use this Website
	  to make sure you understand how your information will be used.</p>

	  <h1>MISCELLANEOUS</h1>

	  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

	  <p>Friendbuy is very sensitive to the issue of the privacy rights of children. Friendbuy Websites and services
	  generally are neither developed for, nor directed at, children.</p>

	  <h2>Your Representations</h2>

	  <p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE OVER PRIVACY IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS
	  PRIVACY POLICY AND APPLICABLE SITE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. You also agree that you have provided notice to, and
	  obtained consent from, any third party individuals whose Information you supply to us with regard to: (a) the
	  purposes for which such third party's Information has been collected; (b) the intended recipients or

	  and which data, if any, are voluntary; and (d) how the third party can access and, if necessary, rectify the
	  data held about him/her. It is the express wish of the parties that the Privacy Policy and all related
	  documents have been drawn up in the English language and that the English version of this Privacy Policy shall
	  be the sole version used in interpreting and enforcing this Privacy Policy.</p>
