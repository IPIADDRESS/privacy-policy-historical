<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

The following describes the Privacy Policy for our website.

<p>Your privacy is important to us.  To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.  You agree to agree to these policies by virtue of using our website in a way that leads to you providing us with personal information..</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: BY USING THIS WEBSITE YOU GIVE YOUR CONSENT THAT ALL PERSONAL DATA SUBMITTED BY YOU MAY BE PROCESSED BY US FOR THE PURPOSES SET OUT BELOW</p>

<p><b>1. COMPLIANCE</b><br>
We comply with Australian Privacy Act. To access current Data Protection legislation materials, click <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au/law/act/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

State Law &amp; Accompanying Rights
Please understand that you may have additional rights originating from State laws based on where you live.  These State-based rights may augment, strengthen, or otherwise somehow compliment any privacy rights you have inherently or under Federal law.  Our policy is to comply fully with the privacy policies of every jurisdiction in which we operate.  Accordingly, you are free to use our Contact information to reach us at any time to assert any State rights.
                              
 <p><b>1.1   Our Commitment To Children's Privacy    </b><br>
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, our website will never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 18, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 18.

Under our Terms of Service and Conditions of Use, children under 18 are not allowed to use our website and access our services.  It is not our intention to offer products or services to minors.
                             

</p><p><b>2. PRIVACY</b><br>
We take care to protect the privacy of our customers. This policy explains how we process information about website visitors and those registered with us.</p>

<p><b>3. WEBSITE DATA COLLECTION</b><br>
Collection of Personal Information
When visiting our website, the IP address used to access our website may be logged along with the dates and times of access. This information is purely used to analyze trends, administer our website, track users movement, and gather broad demographic information for internal use such as statistical assessments and website improvement. Most importantly, any recorded IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

Other information may be collected as well, which is rather typical of most websites.  For instance, the source that referred you to our website is generally known.  Likewise, your duration on our website, and your destination when you leave our website can also be tracked.  Other common data collected includes the type of operating system the computer you are using to access our website has.  Similarly, the type of web browser is often noted.  Again, this is common data collection, and helps ultimately produce a better end-user experience.

Cookies are another common internet practice.  Cookies are a key means of improving user experience by allows us to customize your use of our website.  Simple information is transferred to your computer to allow the content and experience to reflect your actions, preferences, and so on.  You should simply make the assumption our website uses cookies, and note that you are free to make adjustments in your web browser to disable these or otherwise receive notification of cookies so you can take whatever desired action you so choose.  Please understand that refusing cookies may cripple some of our website features and render some aspects useless to you.

At times, you will be fully aware of information received, as you are the direct source providing it.  For instance, you may comment on a blog post, reply to an email (whether broadcast message or autoresponder), provide an email address, complete a survey, requests SMS, or otherwise.  Likewise, purchases necessarily involve collecting certain information, such as credit card information, Paypal addresses, your physical address for billing and/or shipping, phone number, and so on.  Refusing to provide some of this information may lead to us being unable to provide you with the products or services you�ve requested.

A prime example of limited access to our website is where content may be protected by a username and password.  Whether a username and password is generated by our website, or created by you, these will almost always be connected with some other information related to or connected with you.  This is true since much content that is protected on the internet is subscription based, often paid for.  Thus, the username and password must necessarily be tied to your other account data.  Usernames and passwords, by their very nature, should be kept private.  .</p>

<p><b>4. YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b><br>
Personal data submitted by you to this website will be used for the following purposes only. We will only collect and retain personal data to the extent that it is strictly necessary for our purposes. These purposes are;
To assist us in setting up and managing your account. To build up an accurate customer profile of you, in order to make available to you promotional or relevant information from us;</p>

<p>If you have registered with this website and do not wish to receive promotional or relevant information then please "Login", and "Update your details" to opt out.</p>

<p><b> 4.1 Handling of Personal Information </b><br>
Note that any personal information you provide to others apart from us or our vendors is wholly optional.  As an example, you might disclose something in a blog post comment.  That �private� information is now �public,� and we have no control over that.  In like fashion, you sharing information with any other third party not functioning as a service provider to us puts that information beyond our control and becomes subject to the policy that party has in place.
                             
Our primary intention for collecting personal and private information from you is simply to conduct our business.  We can use this internally to better serve you.  Accordingly, we see no reason to share your personal information to other parties and outside interests unless you have authorized us to do so.  Of course, there are instances where your information is stored with third party service providers, such as email service providers, as they provide services that are industry-leading in quality and security and are far more beneficial to our end user than attempting such services �in-house.�  However, you are never required to deal with any such third party directly, they are limited in how they use your information, and they cannot sell or transfer it to others in any way.

However, of course, your information does comprise part of an overall whole.  This aggregate of information, by contrast, may be used to understand our overall user base.  Further, we may share this information about our website visitors as a whole, not individually, with third parties for various purposes, in our sole discretion.

While we are staunch privacy advocates, there are times when even we may be forced to abandon these ideals.  Just as major search engines face ongoing compulsion to provide data against their will, so too may the same occur with our website.  Illegal activity or other serious acts or allegations could create legal liability for our website.  In those cases, we reserve the right to share your information, or else may simply be compelled to do so by law.  On the other hand, there may be times when we would need to share your private information in order to protect our own interests.  For instance, in cases of suspected or alleged copyright infringement or other intellectual property violations, it may be necessary to share personal information.  </p>

<p><b> 4.2 Google Adsense and the DoubleClick DART Cookie   </b><br>
Google, as a third party advertisement vendor, may use cookies to serve ads on this website. The use of DART cookies by Google enables them to serve adverts to visitors that are based on their visits to this website, including past visits, as well as other websites on the internet.

To opt out of the DART cookies you may visit the Google ad and content network privacy policy at the following url http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html Tracking of users through the DART cookie mechanisms are subject to Google's own privacy policies.

Other Third Party ad servers or ad networks may also use cookies to track users activities on this website to measure advertisement effectiveness and other reasons that will be provided in their own privacy policies, our website has no access or control over these cookies that may be used by third party advertisers.  However, you can opt out of some, though likely not all, of these cookies in one easy location at http://ww.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp          </p>

<p><b>Links to Third Party Websites  </b><br>
We have included links on this website for your use and reference. We are not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites. You should be aware that the privacy policies of these websites may differ from our own.  </p>

<ul>
<p>a). Any company or other entity to whom we may sell all or part of our business;</p>
<p>b). Any competent legal, regulatory or law enforcement authority. In the latter case, you will not be informed of any disclosure nor of any reasons for such disclosure and you hereby waive any and all rights that you may have, whether at law or otherwise, of any nature and in any jurisdiction, in connection with such disclosure;</p>
<p>c). Our professional advisers or other appropriate third parties, if your use of our service or this website is in breach of these terms and conditions.</p>
</ul>

<p><b>6. DATA ACCESS &amp; CORRECTIONS</b><br>

Changes to certain parts of your account information can also be made by accessing "Login" and checking "Update your details". We regularly delete data which is no longer required.</p>

<p><b>7. TRANS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS</b><br>
No transfers of your personal data are currently made outside of the European Economic Area. However, we reserve the right to relocate our web servers to a secure location outside the EEA in the future. If we do this, we will enter into agreements requiring the guardians of your personal data to adhere to standards of data protection substantially similar to those prevailing in the European Economic Area. However, the Internet is made up of a large variety of international connections and if you are visiting this website the various communications may well result in the temporary transfer of information outside the European Economic Area other than pursuant to contractual arrangements made by us. By visiting the website and communicating electronically with us you consent to these transfers.</p>



<p><b>9. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTES</b><br>
This policy and consent forms part of our website terms of use and as such it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Western Australia. You irrevocably agree that the courts of Western Australia shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve any dispute or claim of whatever nature arising out of or relating to this policy and consent or otherwise to the use of your personal data, and that the laws of Western Australia shall govern such dispute or claim.

You are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdiction from which you are accessing this website. We operate this website from Western Australia and make no representation or warranty that the information contained herein is appropriate or available for use in other locations outside Western Australia.</p>

<p></p><h2>Social Media Disclosure</h2>
<br>
The following describes the Social Media Disclosure for our website.

<p><b>Social Media Issue </b>
We live in an interesting time when privacy rights are championed alongside an unprecedented voluntary willingness of people to share their most intimate and superfluous life details with the world, even in places such as our website.  While apparently benign on the surface, the dangers of unrestrained public disclosure of sensitive information is beginning to surface.  

Key social media players are being sued for unauthorized or abusive use/misuse of personal information.  Failure to protect and warn are likely going to be focal factors.  Lawsuits are filed seeking damages for statements held to be responsible for people's death or suicide.  Bloggers presuming to operate under an unfettered freedom of speech or greater latitude offered to members of the press are losing civil cases for defamation, slander, libel, and so on.  

As social media rapidly advances to allow more technologically sophisticated and easy dissemination, the simultaneous fallout of revelation without boundaries is mounting.  Thus, a sober approach to the benefits of social media, while sidestepping the perils of imprudent disclosure, can facilitate an enjoyable online experience, without the consequences of excess, in settings such as our own website.
  </p>
  <br>
<p><b>Presence/Scope of Social Media  </b>
You should assume that social media is in use on our website.  A simple click of a button to endorse a person, product, or service is building a cumulative profile about you, which you should always assume can be discovered by others.  Attempting to share a website with someone, whether by direct press of a button or else by email forwarding facilitated on a website, you should assume that this may not stop with the intended recipient, and that this can generate information about you that could be seen by a veritable infinite number of people.  Such a domino effect could initiate right here on our website.  

Something as simple as a blog comment provides the opportunity for knee-jerk reactions that can become public and may not truly represent a position (at least in strength or severity) that you might hold after a period of more reasoned contemplation.  You should also note that the ease of accessing one site through the login credentials of another, or the use of a global login for access to multiple sites can accumulate  a dossier on you and your online behavior that may reveal more information to unintended parties than you might realize or want.  Any or all of these features could exist on our website at one time or another. 

These few examples illustrate some possible ways that social media can exist, though it is not an exhaustive list and new technologies will render this list outdated quickly.  The objective is to realize the reach of social media, its widespread presence on websites in various forms (including this website), and develop a responsible approach to using it.
  </p>
  <br>
<p><b>Protecting Others </b>
You should recognize the fact that divulgences made in and on social media platforms on this website and others are rarely constrained just to you.  Disclosures are commonly made about group matters that necessarily affect and impact other people.  Other disclosures are expressly about third parties, sometimes with little discretion.  What can appear funny in one moment can be tragic in the next.  And a subtle "public" retaliation can have lifetime repercussions.  

Ideal use of social media on our website would confine your disclosures primarily to matters pertaining to you, not others.  If in doubt, it's best to err on the side of non-disclosure.  It's doubtful the disclosure is so meaningful that it cannot be offset by the precaution of acting to protect the best interests of someone who is involuntarily being exposed by your decision to disclose something on our website (or another).
 </p>
 <br>
<p><b>Protecting Yourself </b>
You should likewise pause to consider the long-term effects of a split-second decision to publicly share private information about yourself on our website.  Opinions, likes, dislikes, preferences, and otherwise can change.  Openly divulging perspectives that you hold today, may conflict with your developing views into the futures.  Yet, the "new you" will always stand juxtaposed against the prior declarations you made that are now concretized as part of your public profile.  While the contents of your breakfast may hold little long-term impact, other data likewise readily shared can have consequences that could conceivably impact your ability to obtain certain employment or hinder other life experiences and ambitions.

As with sharing information about other people, extreme caution should be used before revealing information about yourself.  If in doubt, it's likely best not to do it.  The short term gain, if any, could readily be outweighed by later consequences.  Finally, you should note that we are not responsible for removing content once shared, and we may not be able to do so.

  <br>
<p><b>Restrictions on Use of Social Media Data  </b>
You, as a visitor to our website, are not permitted to "mine" social media or other platforms contained herein for personal information related to others.  Even where people have publicly displayed data, you should not construe that as though you have the liberty to capture, reproduce, or reuse that information.  Any use of social media or related platforms on our website are for interactive use only, relevant only during the website visit. 
 </p>
 <br>
<p><b>Accuracy of Social Media Data   </b>
As any social media platform is built on user-generated content, you should consider this fact in seeking to determine the authenticity of anything you read.  We are not responsible for verifying any user-generated content for accuracy.  A best practices policy would be to view all such content as strictly opinion, not fact. 
  </p>
  <br>
<p><b>Potential Issues of Liability   </b>
You should also be mindful of the fact that your words could trigger liability for harm caused to others.  While you have the right to free speech, you do not have the right to damage other people.  Under basic principles of tort law, you are always responsible, personally, for situations where either:
 <br>
1. you were required to act, but did not (i.e. - some "duty of care")     <br>
2. your were required to refrain from acting, but did not (i.e. - slander, defamation, etc.)
   <br>
<b>These "sins of omission and commission" could cause problems for you,</b> irrespective of whether you assert you are conducting business under the guise of one or more business entities.  Illegal and unethical conduct, when done in the name of a corporation or LLC, is still illegal and unethical conduct.  As it is rarely part of a business plan to engage in illegal and unethical conduct, you are doubtfully operating in any official capacity, but rather, perhaps, leveraging that capacity to effectuate personal wrongdoing.  You should consult a licensed attorney if you wish legal advice as to the (potential) ramification of your situation or legal problems stemming from this website or another.
