           	          <p align="left">General: We use your Collected Information to improve our  marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to  improve our content and product offerings and to customize our Site's content,  layout and service specifically for you. We may use your Collected Information  to service your Account with us, including but not limited to investigating  problems, resolving disputes and enforcing agreements with us. We do not sell,  rent, trade or exchange any personally-identifying information of our Users. We  may provide your Collected Information to our affiliates and service providers  under contract (such as customer care) to support the operation of the Site and  our services. We may share certain aggregate information based on analysis of  Collected Information with our partners, customers, advertisers or potential  Users. We may use your Collected Information to execute marketing campaigns,  promotions or advertising messages on behalf of third parties; however, in  these circumstances, your Collected Information will not be disclosed to such  third parties unless you respond to the marketing, promotion or advertising  message. Your Collected Information may be transferred, stored, used and processed  outside your home jurisdiction. In case of a merger with or transfer of  business to another business entity, we will transfer your Collected  Information to the entity which acquires the business (Should such a  combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this  Privacy Policy with respect to your Collected Information). <br>
           	            Registration Information: We may use your Registration  Information to provide services that you request or to contact you regarding  additional services about which FRBIZ.COM determines that you might be  interested.

           	            Publishing Information: All of your Publishing  Information will be publicly available on the Site and therefore accessible by  any internet user. Any Publishing Information that you disclose to FRBIZ.COM  becomes public information and you relinquish any proprietary rights (including  but not limited to the rights of confidentiality and copyrights) in such  information. You should exercise caution when deciding to include personal or  proprietary information in the Publishing Information that you submit to us. <br>
           	            Payment Information: FRBIZ.COM will share your Payment  Information with banks or vendors relevant to the transaction in order to  enable transactions to be completed. In addition, FRBIZ.COM may use Payment  Information to determine your credit-worthiness and, in the process of such  determination, FRBIZ.COM may make such Payment Information available to banks  or credit agencies. Any credit card information that you provide through the  Site is directly submitted to a payment server of the credit card processing  bank. FRBIZ.COM does not maintain electronic or physical copies of your credit  card information.
