		<h1>Frame.io's Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Frame.io, Inc. (“<u>we</u>”, “<u>our</u>” or “<u>us</u>”) on the

		 collection, use 

		and disclosure of your information on www.frame.io (the “<u>Site</u>”) and the services, features, content or applications we 

		offer (collectively with the Site, the “<u>Services</u>”). We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) if 

		you register for the Site and the Services, through your user account on the Services (your “<u>Account</u>”); (ii) your use of the

		Services generally; and (iii) from third party websites and services. When you use the Services, you are consenting to the 

		collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

		<h2>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>
		<p>This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“<u>Personal Information</u>”) gathered when

		you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our 

		business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.</p>

		<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited

		to any third party websites, services and applications (“<u>Third Party Services</u>”) that you elect to access through the Service 

		or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services 

		that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party 

		Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.</p>

		<h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
		<p>The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection with

		certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information. We collect the 

		following types of information from our users.</p>

		<h4>Account Information:</h4>

		<p>When you create an Account, you will provide information that could be Personal Information, such as your name,

		username, password, email address, profile picture, location and company affiliation. You acknowledge that this 

		information may be personal to you, and by creating an Account on the Services and providing Personal Information 

		to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not be anonymous. We may use your contact 

		information to send you information about our Services, but only rarely when we feel such information is important. You 

		may unsubscribe from these messages through your Account settings, although we, regardless, reserve the right to contact 

		you when we believe it is necessary, such as for account recovery purposes.</p>

		<h4>User Content:</h4>
		
		<p>Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services, such as written comments. All content 

		submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your account. We may 

		continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this 

		Privacy Policy.</p>

		<h4>Financial Information:</h4>

		<p>We do not currently collect financial information, such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration

		date or other financial information); that information is collected and stored by our third party payment processing company 

		(the “<u>Payment Processor</u>”), and use and storage of that information is governed by the Payment Processor’s applicable 

		terms of service and privacy policy.</p>

		<h4>IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services,

			including your IP address and cookie information. This information is used for fighting spam/malware and also to 

			facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on).</li><br>

			<li>Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as which parts of the Site you use and the number

			and frequency of visitors to the Site. We may use this data in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of 

			data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that 

			we can analyze and improve them.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Email Communications:</h4>
		<p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our customer 

		service.</p>

		<h4>Information Collected Using Cookies:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a

			website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable 

			our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Services 

			through the Internet.</li><br>

			<li>Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, but we may combine the general information

			collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, we use cookies to identify 

			that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services and may associate that information with your Account if 

			you have one.</li><br>

			<li>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new

			cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of 

			each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that

			to take advantage the most attractive features of the Services.</li><br>

			<li>This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not

			control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link 

			points may set cookies on your computer.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Aggregate Information:</h4>

		<p>We collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the Services

		(“<u>Aggregate Information</u>”). Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. While Aggregate Information is 

		not Personal Information, it may be tied back to you, your Account or your web browser.</p>

		<h2>How, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared?</h2>
		<p>The Services are designed to help you share information with others. As a result, some of the information generated

		through the Services is shared publicly or with third parties.</p>
		
		<h4>Public Information about Your Activity on the Services:</h4>

		<p>Some of your activity on and through the Services is public by default. This may include, but is not limited to, content you 

		have posted publicly on the Site or otherwise through the Services.</p>

		<p>Registered users may have some of this information associated with their Accounts. Unregistered users will not have this

		association, but information concerning their use of the Services (such as what pages they have visited) may be tracked 

		anonymously through the use of cookies and stored by us.</p>

		<p>Please also remember that if you choose to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the Services, then

		that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be publicly available. Individuals 

		reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your 

		knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any 

		specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through the Services.</p>

		<h4>IP Address Information:</h4>
		<p>While we collect and store IP address information, that information is not made public. We do at times, however, share

		this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise 

		specified in this Privacy Policy.</p>

		<h4> Information You Elect to Share:</h4>
		<p>You may access other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those Third Party

		Services from within the Site. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these Third Party Services, 

		and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Services’ privacy policies. This Privacy Policy 

		only governs information collected on the Services.</p>

		<h4>Aggregate Information:</h4>
		<p>We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. 

		We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Services and 

		their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them. In 

		addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you 

		that they have independently developed or acquired.</p>

		<h4>Email Communications with Us:</h4>
		<p>As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us, such as communications

		relating to your Account. Communications relating to your Account will only be sent for purposes important to the 

		Services, such as password recovery.</p>

		<h4>User Profile Information:</h4>
		<p>User profile information including your name and other information you enter may be displayed to other users to facilitate

		user interaction within the Services. We will not directly reveal user email addresses to other users.</p>
		

		<h4>Financial Information:</h4>
		<p>As stated above, we do not currently collect financial information, as that information is collected and stored by our

		Payment Processor. However, we may from time to time request and receive some of your financial information from our 

		Payment Processor for the purposes of completing transactions you have initiated through the Services, enrolling you in 

		discount, rebate, and other programs in which you elect to participate, protecting against or identify possible fraudulent 

		transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business.</p>


		<h4>Information Shared with Our Agents:</h4>
		<p>We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our

		control (our “<u>Agents</u>”). We may need to share Personal Information with our Agents in order to provide products or 

		services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other 

		information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal 

		Information with our Agents.</p>

		<h4>Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:</h4>
		<p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the 

		transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business 

		or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You 

		acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal 

		Information as set forth in this policy.</p>

		<h4>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others:</h4>
		<p>We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as it reasonably believes is necessary to (i)

		satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms 

		of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or 

		technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. 

		This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware 

		prevention.</p>

		<h4>Information We Share With Your Consent:</h4>
		<p>Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will 

		be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>

		<h2>Is Information About Me Secure?</h2>
		<p>Your Account information will be protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized

		access to your Account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting 

		access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account.</p>
		<p>We seek to protect Account information to ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee the security of any

		Account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the 

		security of user information at any time.</p>
		<p>We otherwise store all of your information, including your IP address information, using industry-standard techniques. We

		do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store, 

		Personal Information or otherwise.</p>

		<h2>What Information of Mine Can I Access?</h2>
		<p>If you are a registered user, you can access information associated with your Account by logging into the Services.

		Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings.</p>
		<p><i>California Privacy Rights</i>: Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to

		ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information which we share with our affiliates and/

		or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you 

		are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: 

		Frame.io 307 7th Ave. Suite 907. New York, NY. 10001.</p>

		<h2>How Can I Delete My Account?</h2>
		<p>Should you ever decide to delete your Account, you may do so by emailing support@frame.io. If you 

		terminate your Account, any association between your Account and information we store will no longer be accessible 

		through your Account. However, given the nature of sharing on the Services, any public activity on your Account prior to 

		deletion will remain stored on our servers and will remain accessible to the public.</p>

		<h2>What Choices Do I Have Regarding My Information?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>You can use some of the features of the Services without registering, thereby limiting the type of information that we

			collect.</li><br>

			<li>You can always opt not to disclose certain information to us, even though it may be needed to take advantage of some

			of our features.</li><br>

			<li>You can delete your Account. Please note that we will need to verify that you have the authority to delete the Account,

			and activity generated prior to deletion will remain stored by us and may be publicly accessible.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>What Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?</h2>
		<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in

		effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you 

		by posting an announcement on the Services or sending you an email. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy 

		when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first posted.</p>

		<h2>What If I Have Questions or Concerns?</h2>
		<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services, please send us a detailed message to legal@frame.io . We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.</p>
