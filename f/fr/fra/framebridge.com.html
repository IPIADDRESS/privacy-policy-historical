Examples of Personal Information include your name, email address, postal address, shipping address, phone number, and shopping history on our Site. Our mobile application may request access to the photographs stored on your mobile device; if you choose to allow that access some of the photographs may be personally identifiable. You may also provide us with your email address or other personal information in an offline format. If you register using a social media account (such as Facebook Connect or Google Connect), we collect information from the site you use to register consistent with that site’s privacy policy as described in the Social Media section below.</li><br><li><b>Payment Information:</b> If you use the Site to make purchases, we will also collect certain payment information, such as payment card, PayPal or other financial account information, and billing address. A third-party payment processor collects that information; we do not store your credit card information.</li><br><li><b>Non-Identifying Information:</b> We also may collect other information, such as ZIP codes, and other information regarding your use of the Site (“Non-Identifying Information”) or from you in response to surveys. Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified (for example, combining information with your name). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information, but Framebridge will treat the combined information as Personal Information.</li><br><li><b>General Audience Site:</b> The Site is general audience and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children younger than age 13. If we become aware that a child younger than 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our files.</li><br></ul><p><b><i>Information Received from Third Parties</i></b></p><p>We also may receive information about you from third parties. For example, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records, or third parties may provide information in connection with a co-marketing agreement or at your request (such as if you choose to sign in with a third-party service such as Facebook). If we combine the information we receive from others with Personal Information we collect through the Site, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p><p><b><i>Information Collected from Users Automatically</i></b></p><p>We and our third party service providers, including advertisers, analytics, and third party content providers, may automatically collect certain information from you whenever you access or interact with the Site. This information may include, among other information, the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to the Site, the search terms you entered into a search engine that led you to the Site, areas within the Site that you visited, and other information commonly shared when browsers communicate with websites.</p><p>The information we collect also includes the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address or other device identifier (“Device Identifier”) for any device (computer, mobile phone, tablet, etc.) used to access the Site. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned or connected to the device you use to access the Site, and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access the Site. If such information is linked to your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</p><p>The technology used to collect information automatically from Framebridge Users may include the following:</p><ul><li><b>Cookies:</b> Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use both persistent cookies that remain on your computer or similar device (such as to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site and to track your compliance with any Framebridge applicable policies) and session ID cookies, which expire at the end of your browser session (for example, to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how Framebridge Users interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by Framebridge Users and web traffic routing on the Site). You may be able to instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all functionality of the Site.</li><br><li><b>Web Beacons:</b> We may also employ software technology known as “web beacons” or “tracking tags” to help us keep track of what content on our Site is effective and to serve relevant advertising to you. Web beacons are small graphics with a unique identifier that may be invisible to you, and which are used to track the online activity of Internet users. Web beacons are embedded in the web pages you review or email messages you receive. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Site, to monitor how Framebridge Users navigate the Site, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</li><br><li><b>Embedded Scripts:</b> An Embedded Script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Site.</li></ul><p>In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes and we may use third parties to perform these services on our behalf.</p><p><b><i>How We Respond To Do Not Track Signals</i></b></p><p>Please note that your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online service you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many websites and online services, Framebridge does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.</p><p><b><i>Community Postings</i></b></p><p>The Site may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly on blogs, as reviews, through interactive features and through other communication functionality (<b>"Community Postings"</b>). You may choose, through such features or otherwise, to submit or post questions, comments, or other content (collectively, "User Submitted Materials"). Such User Submitted Materials may be displayed publicly along with certain of your Personal Information, such as your name or a screen name. Please note that your use of Community Postings is subject to our Terms of Use.</p><p><b>Note that any Community Postings that you make are public –others will have access to your User Submitted Materials and may use it or share it with third parties. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information in your User Submitted Materials, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply.</b></p><p><b><i>Social Media</i></b></p><p>You may register to join the Site directly via the Site or by logging into your account with a third party social media service via our Site (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, and other third party services that let you sign in using your existing credentials with those services). If you choose to register via a social media service, or to later link your account on our Site to your account with a social media service, we will use Personal Information you have provided to the social media service (such as your name, email address, gender and other information you make publicly available via the social media service) to create your account. Note that the information we collect from and through a social media service may depend on the privacy settings you have with the social media service, that site’s terms of service, and the permissions you grant to us in connection with linking your account with the Site to your account with a social media service. Other than what we may share with the social media service as described below, the Personal Information a social media service has about you is obtained by the social media service independent of our Site, and Framebridge is not responsible for it.</p><p>The Framebridge Site also may permit additional interactions between it and a third party website, service, or other content provider, such as enabling you to “like” or share content to a third party social media service, or to share content from a third party social media service to our Site. If you choose to “like” or share content, or to otherwise share information from or via our Site with a third party site or service, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party may have access to information about you and your use of our Site (and we may have access to information about you from that third party). Please note that your relationship with any social media service is governed solely by your agreement(s) with such social media service and your interactions with third parties through social media or similar features are governed by the respective privacy policies of those third parties.</p><p>You represent that you are entitled to use your social media account for the purposes described herein without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern the social media service, and without obligating Framebridge to pay any fees or making Framebridge subject to any usage limitations imposed by such social media service. If your social media account terminates, then functions enabled through the link between your Framebridge account and your social media account will terminate as well.</p><li id="use-and-retention-of-information"><b>USE AND RETENTION OF INFORMATION</b></li><p>Framebridge may use information collected through the Site, including your Personal Information and Device Identifier, in order to:</p><ul><li>process your registration with the Site, including verifying the information that you provide to us;</li><br><li>provide you with services or information or fulfill transactions that you have requested or otherwise agreed to receive;</li><br><li>send you special offers from us, artists on our Site, our advertisers, or third-party business partners or other third-parties that we believe may be of interest to you, and to tailor content we display to you, including offers we present to you, both on the Site and elsewhere online or offline;</li><br><li>publish promotional material, including in such material Community Postings that you have made;</li><br><li>allow you to participate in the public areas and other features of the Site;</li><br><li>provide customer service to you, including, without limitation, to respond to your questions, complaints or comments;</li><br><li>contact you with regard to your use of the Site or, in our discretion, changes to the Site's policies;</li><br><li>improve the Site or our services, and for internal business purposes;</li><br><li>for legal and regulatory compliance; or</li><br><li>for purposes as disclosed at the time you provide your information or otherwise with your consent, and as further described in this Privacy Policy.</li><br></ul><li id="information-sharing"><b>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</b></li><p>We may disclose Personal Information and Non-Identifying information to third parties in our discretion as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
