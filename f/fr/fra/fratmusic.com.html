<h2>How the Website Uses Information Provided by You </h2>
<p>
Fratmusic uses your user username and password to grant you access to and use of the Website. Your e-mail address will be used, at your request, to send you a copy of your user name and password. If you provide personally identifiable information, it will be used to provide you with the service you have requested. We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products or services, and/or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs.

We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services. We may also provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs or match your interests. While Fratmusic will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, Fratmusic does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties. We may also disclose appropriate information, including personally identifiable information, in order to cooperate with official investigations or legal proceedings, including, for example, in response to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or other legal process.
