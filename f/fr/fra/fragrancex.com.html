          Security&nbsp;</a></b><br>
          <br>
          The FragranceX.com web site uses secure sockets layer (SSL) to encrypt 
          the transfer of sensitive information, such as your account password 
          and billing information, from your web browser to our web server.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          The same SSL protocol also acts to authenticate the 
          www.FragranceX.com.com site and prevent unauthorized "hackers" from 
          masquerading as the FragranceX.com site. This is accomplished through 
          a "digital certificate", which is an unforgeable electronic "identity 
          card".&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          If another website attempts to falsely identify itself as 
          www.FragranceX.com.com, your web browser will display a warning 
          indicating that there is a problem with the digital certificate for 
          www.FragranceX.com.com. Do not log in to the FragranceX.com site if 
          you see any such warning.<br>
          <br>
          <b>How You Can Help Keep Your Information Secure&nbsp;</b><br>
          <br>
          The most important step you can take to keep your information secure 
          is to keep your password secure. Do not give your password to other 
          people and avoid choosing "easily guessed" passwords (e.g. any single 
          word in the dictionary, proper names of people and places easily 
          associated with you, etc.). Change your password immediately if you 
          suspect someone has been accessing your account without your 
          permission (click on the "Profile" section of the FragranceX.com web 
          site after logging in). If for any reason you suspect a security 
          violation has occurred, please immediately send an email to
          <a href="mailto:support@fragrancex.com">support@fragrancex.com</a>

          <a href="#IP Address">IP addresses</a> "in the aggregate" do so to

          Cookies are small pieces of information that a web site stores in your 
          computer. Temporary, or session, cookies only last as long as your 
          browser is running. Persistent cookies are stored on your hard disk 
          (they take up very little space). Sites often use cookies to identify 
          repeat visitors and offer them personalized service, or to simply 
          associate data with a particular visitor, like a shopping cart.<br>

          <br>
          When you are connected to the Internet, your computer has a unique 
          Internet ID called an IP address. Most people that connect through a 
          dial-up service, such as America Online, get a different IP address 
          each time they login. Others logging in from work or school might have 
          a permanently assigned IP address, called a static IP address. It is 
          difficult or impossible for a web site to collect personal information 
          about you (i.e., your name, email address, etc.) from your IP address 
          alone, although a static IP Address can be used to identify a little 
          bit more about you (i.e. your company name, or university name).<br>
          <br>
          <b><a name="SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)">SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)&nbsp;</a></b><br>
          <br>
          SSL is a communication protocol that accomplishes two things:&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          1. It allows your web browser to verify that a web site you're 
          visiting is actually the site that you think it is (and not some site 
          posing as another).&nbsp;<br>
          2. It lets your web browser and a web server communicate with each 
          other (i.e. pass web pages back and forth) in a completely secure 
          fashion through the use of very strong encryption techniques. This 
          encrypted communication makes it impossible for anyone else to see any 
          information passed between your web browser and our web server.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          On WebTV, press the "INFO" button on the keyboard (select the 
          "Options" button and then select "INFO" on the small remote). If the 
          "Security Details" button is displayed, the page is secure. Select
