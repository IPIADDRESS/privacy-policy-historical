<li class="cat-item cat-item-82"><a href="http://www.franchisehelp.com/industry/business-opportunity" title="People often get confused as to the difference between a business opportunity and a franchise. Loosely speaking, a business opportunity is anything that allows a person to start his or her own business. A business opportunity is typically less regulated but easier to start when compared to a franchise. Business opportunity seekers will be pleased with the comprehensive database below this article.

New Business Opportunities
As the land of entrepreneurship and innovation, the U.S. offers a nearly unlimited selection of business opportunities, spanning every state, industry, and area of interest. Low cost business opportunities exist even for those with a small amount of capital but big dreams. Whether youâre looking to own a part of a regional enterprise or a global conglomerate, thereâs a business opportunity for you. We also have small business opportunities available for those who can't commit themselves full-time.

The business opportunitiesâ licensor usually sets the entrepreneur up with a turnkey business, helping them find a good location and explaining the product, but afterward are usually not strict about how the business opportunity owner actually operates.

<li class="cat-item cat-item-21"><a href="http://www.franchisehelp.com/industry/business-services-franchise" title="Business services include any support services that are provided for other businesses. Nearly any business can count itself a part of the business services industry by virtue of selling to other companies, but there are distinct advantages to specializing in business service. We've compiled a database of the best business service franchises below this article for your convenience.

Business Services Franchise Opportunity
Every business demands various services to help them improve their operations which is why the business service industry will always be needed. In addition, low capital cost and high use of labor makes it a very stable market. As a business service owner, you will not have to constantly worry about some transformative product that will suddenly replace your services. Another important aspect is that the services are not location dependent so a franchise can provide value to any part of the country.

Part of your investigation into this field will include deciding what scope your franchise will target. For instance, a general business services franchise may try to provide for all the standard needs of a company, while others choose to specialize more. Some market themselves to large corporations, while a small business services franchise is better fitted to proprietary owners.

Business Services Franchises For Sale
Businesses have many of the same needs as individuals, such as:
insurance
tax filing
printing
packing and shipping
However, businesses have other needs that are better fulfilled through specialized business support services.

Business to business franchises only deal with other businesses, so they usually churn at a higher volume than their consumer-oriented counterparts. Top business service franchises can handle this additional responsibility by targeting their services to a narrow share of the market. Some provide on-site services such as commercial cleaning or maintenance, but most tend to operate more remotely, such as:
Accounting
Staffing Agencies
Business Brokerage
Financial Services
Business Consulting
Advertising
