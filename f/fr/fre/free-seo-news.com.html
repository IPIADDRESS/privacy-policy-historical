<h1 class="three">We respect your privacy</h1> <p>At Axandra GmbH we respect and protect your privacy. Our site is a safe environment
 for anyone who visits and purchases.</p>
 <p>We are committed to providing you with the best possible online service
 and experience as well as the best products. We never rent, sell or share any information you give
 us.</p>

 <p>Your privacy is important to us!</p> <a name="general"></a><h3>General information</h3>
 <p>When you visit the Axandra site, we collect some
 basic information that does not identify individual users.
 This includes which pages are visited, types of products
 purchased, and any feedback from our visitors. We then
 collate this information with other pieces of information
 to improve our site and make your experience on the site
 as valuable and efficient as possible.</p>
 <p>On some pages, you can order products, make requests,
 and register to receive unlock codes. The types of personal
 information collected on these pages are:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>First and last name
 </li><li>Billing address
 </li><li>Shipping address(es)
 </li><li>Email address
 </li><li>Phone number
 </li><li>Credit card account number
 </li><li>Titles of items you purchase from us
 </li></ul>

 <p>We use the information you provide about yourself when
 placing an order only to complete that order, to send
 you our announement newsletter (we'll inform you when
 updates are available) and to use it internally for statistical
 reasons. We do not share this information with outside
 parties except to the extent necessary to complete that
 order.</p>
 <p>We use return email addresses to answer the emails we
 receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose
 and are not shared with outside parties.</p>
 <p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable
 information provided to us online in ways unrelated to
 the ones described above, without also providing you with
 an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated
 uses.</p>

 <a name="card"></a><h3>Credit dard processing and security</h3><p></p>
 <p>Shopping with Axandra GmbH is absolutely
 safe - you never have to worry about credit card safety
 when you shop at our site. We guarantee that each
 purchase you make is protected and safe. If fraudulent
 charges are ever made, you will not have to pay them.</p>

 <p>Axandra GmbH uses the services of SWREG.org
 to provide the highest level of secure online transactions.
 Your credit card
 information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering
 system. SWREG.org maintains their own privacy and security
 policies. If you have questions about these services,
 or how they handle the information they receive, please
 contact <a href="http://www.SWREG.org" target="_blank">SWREG</a>.</p>
 <p>All information you enter in the SWREG.org order form
 will be shared with Axandra GmbH in
 order to send you the unlock code for the software. This
 does not apply to your credit card information. We never
 get your credit card number. SWREG will send you a single
 additional email message one week after your purchase.</p>
 <p>You can access all your personally identifiable information,
 that we collect online and maintain, by sending us an email
 with your name and the unlock code for the Axandra product
 you purchased. The exception, as explained above or in
 the "Credit Card Processing and Security" section,
 is your credit information, since it is not kept.</p>

 <p>You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable
 information by sending us a request that credibly shows
 error.</p>
<a name="commitment"></a> <h3>Our commitment to data security </h3>
