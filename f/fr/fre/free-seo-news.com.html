 <p>At Axandra GmbH we respect
 and protect your privacy. Our site is a safe environment
 for anyone who visits and purchases. We are committed
 to providing you with the best possible online service
 and experience as well as the best products. The purpose
 of this policy statement is to fully share with you:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>why the Axandra online shop is so secure
 </li><li>a complete description of what we collect
 </li><li>how we use that information
 </li><li>how you can access or correct your information
 </li></ul>
 <p>We never rent, sell or share any information you give
 us. You privacy is important to us!</p>
 <p><b>What information does Axandra GmbH
 collect, and how is it used?</b></p>
 <p>When you visit the Axandra.com site, we collect some
 basic information that does not identify individual users.
 This includes which pages are visited, types of products
 purchased, and any feedback from our visitors. We then
 collate this information with other pieces of information
 to improve our site and make your experience on the site
 as valuable and efficient as possible.</p>
 <p>On some pages, you can order products, make requests,
 and register to receive unlock codes. The types of personal
 information collected at these pages are:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>First and last name
 </li><li>Billing address
 </li><li>Shipping address(es)
 </li><li>Email address
 </li><li>Phone number
 </li><li>Credit card account number
 </li><li>Titles of items you purchase from us
 </li></ul>
 <p><b>The Way We Use Information </b></p>
 <p>We use the information you provide about yourself when
 placing an order only to complete that order, to send
 you our announement newsletter (we'll inform you when
 updates are available) and to use it internally for statistical
 reasons. We do not share this information with outside
 parties except to the extent necessary to complete that
 order.</p>
 <p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we
 receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose
 and are not shared with outside parties.</p>
 <p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable
 information provided to us online in ways unrelated to
 the ones described above without also providing you with
 an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated
 uses.</p>
 <p><b>Credit Card Processing and Security</b></p>
 <p>Shopping with Axandra GmbH is absolutely
 safe - you never have to worry about credit-card safety
 when you are shopping at our site. We guarantee that each
 purchase you make is protected and safe. If fraudulent
 charges are ever made, you will not have to pay for them.</p>
 <p>Axandra GmbH uses the services of SWREG.org
 to provide the highest level of secure online transactions.
 Your credit card
 information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering
 system. SWREG.org maintains their own privacy and security
 policies. If you have questions about these services,
 or how they handle the information they receive, please
 contact <a href="http://www.SWREG.org" target="_blank">SWREG</a>.</p>
 <p>All information you enter in the SWREG.org order form
 will be shared with Axandra GmbH in
 order to send you the unlock code for the software. This
 does not apply to your credit card information. We never
 get your credit card number. SWREG will send you a single
 additional email message one week after your purchase.</p>
 <p><b>How You Can Access or Correct Your Information</b></p>
 <p>You can access all your personally identifiable information
 that we collect online and maintain by sending us an email
 with your name and the unlock code for the Axandra product
 you purchased. The exception, as explained above or in
 the "Credit Card Processing and Security" section,
 is your credit information, since it is not kept.</p>
 <p>You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable
 information by sending us a request that credibly shows
 error.</p>
 <p><b>Our Commitment to Data Security </b></p>
 <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy,
 and ensure the correct use of information, we have put
 in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
 procedures to safeguard and secure the information we
 collect online.</p>
 <p><b>Other</b></p>

 on these Web sites is beyond our reach and will be the
 responsibility of the linked-to entity and not Voget Selbach

 <li>Safety in Numbers: Axandra products are sold by SWREG,
 Inc. USA. SWREG is one of the oldest and biggest
 online stores on the Internet.
 When you shop at Atlantic Coast, you'll be one of thousands
 of customers who have safely shopped with SWREG
 without credit card fraud.<br>
 <br>
 </li><li>Safe Technology: SWREG's secure server software
 (SSL) is the industry standard and among the best software
 available today for secure commerce transactions. It

 will not be liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges.
 In the unlikely event that you are subject to fraudulent
 charges, remember to first notify your credit card provider
 in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
 If, for whatever reason, you are held responsible for
 this amount, Axandra.com will cover the entire liability
 for you, up to $50, as long as the unauthorized use of
 your credit card resulted through no fault of your own
 from purchases made from Axandra.com while using the secure
 SWREG.org server.</p>
