<h3>Location information</h3>
Freeboh offers a variety of location-aware products and services to provide you with more relevant content for where you are in the world.

Freeboh is not able to control the sharing of such information directly. Instead, you are able to withdraw your permission for Freeboh to access pinpointed location information through your web browser permissions.<br><br>
When your web browser or email application requests a web page or email from another computer on the Internet, it automatically sends that computer the address where it should reply with the information requested. This is your computer's "IP address" (IP stands for "Internet protocol"). Depending on how you connect to the Internet through your Internet Service Provider (ISP), the IP address assigned to your computer may be different every time you log on. Freeboh may derive information about where your device is generally located based on your IP Address.<br><br>

Freeboh may also access publicly available calendar information for displaying significant public events, such as public holidays.<br><br>
<h3>Information about others/inviting friends</h3>
You can also submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to share content or recommendations. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. Some of our Services also allow you to invite your friends to join our services and to connect with you through social media features. Inviting friends is always optional. To do so, you may provide their contact information or may enter your log-in credentials to import email addresses from your address book from other sites that support such functionality (e.g., Google mail). You select the friends you want to invite to share in this experience.<br><br>
While the supply of the information by you is voluntary, if you cannot provide or do not wish to provide the information sought, Freeboh may be unable to meet the purposes for which the information was collected.<br><br>
Although every reasonable effort has been made to ensure that all personal data will be so protected, Freeboh cannot be responsible for any unauthorised use or misuse of such information and from risks which are inherent in all internet communications.<br><br>
Freeboh reserves the right to change this Policy with or without notice from time to time.<br><br>
