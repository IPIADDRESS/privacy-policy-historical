<strong>SCOPE AND YOUR AUTHORIZATION</strong>
<p>This Privacy Statement ("<strong>Privacy Statement</strong>") applies to KingsIsle Entertainment, Inc.

As a result, if you are visiting or using our Online Games and Services from a country other than the United States, your personal data will cross an international boundary.

<strong>Passive Information Collection</strong>
<p>As you navigate through our Online Games and Services, other information that does not, on its own, identify any particular individual may be collected. This information includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Log data</strong>. When you use or interact with our Online Games and Services, our servers record certain information that is automatically reported by your browser (such as Apple's Safari, Microsoft's Edge, Google's Chrome, or Mozilla's Firefox) or device each time you request our Online Games and Services, or when content is downloaded to your browser from our Online Games and Services. This "<strong>log data</strong>" includes your IP address (which is used to infer approximate location); Internet service provider; browser type and settings (<em>for example</em>, content language, cookie/DNT preferences); device information (<em>for example</em>, type of device, operating system, device manufacturer); referring/exiting URL; request/response date and time; "clickstream" data which reflects activities on our Online Games and Services such as the features you visit and in what order; device ID or advertising ID; and data contained in cookies and similar technologies (discussed below). <strong>However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal data.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Location data</strong>. Depending on the Online Games and Services and your computer or device permissions, we may collect information about your device's approximate (<em>for example</em>, country or zip code) or precise location ("<strong>location data</strong>"). Various technologies may be used to collect this location information, such as IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may provide information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points, and cell towers. <strong>We will only collect your computer's or device's precise location with your consent.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Cookie data</strong>. Our Online Games and Services also use technologies which are common among websites and online environments to collect and store certain information (such as log data or unique identifiers) when you visit or interact with our Online Games and Services. These technologies include cookies, Web beacons (also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs), statistical identifiers, and similar technologies. A "<strong>cookie</strong>" is a unique numeric code that is transferred to your computer or device to track your interests and preferences and to recognize you as a return visitor. A "<strong>Web beacon</strong>" is a transparent graphic image placed on a website that enables the monitoring of things such as user activity and site traffic. "<strong>Statistical identifiers</strong>" refer to identifiers created using certain device information and identifiers that makes your browser or device sufficiently distinct for a server or similar system to reasonably determine that it is encountering the same browser or device over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Online Games and Services use cookies and similar technologies to help us secure our Online Games and Services, as well as the information processed by our Online Games and Services; to monitor and enhance the performance of our Online Games and Services; to remember your preferences on our Online Games and Services; to collect "clickstream" data which reflects activities on our Online Games and Services such as the features you visit and in what order; to better understand visitor and user behavior; and to facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and website features.</p>
<p>The relevant legal basis under European law (where applicable) is our legitimate interest to guarantee the stability and security of our Online Games and Services, provide, manage and optimize our products and services (including our Online Games and Services), improve your experience while using our Online Games and Services, promote our products and services, provide customer support, develop new products and services, better understand users and their preferences, and measure and manage the frequency of our ads.</p>
<p>We may tie personal data actively collected from you to information collected passively as described above or from third parties. <em>In such cases, if we associate non-personal data with personal data, the combined information will be treated as personal data for as long as it remains combined.</em></p>
<strong>Do Not Track</strong>
<p>Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to websites with which the browser communicates. The webserver for our Online Games and Services does not currently respond to these signals.</p>
<strong>Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies by Our Online Partners</strong>
<p>We may use vendors and other online partners to perform some of the activities described above, including to provide audience measurement and analytics services, to serve ads on our behalf on our Online Games and Services and on third-party sites, and to track and report on the performance of such ads. These online partners may use cookies and similar technologies to collect and store certain log data, location data, cookie data and other information when you visit or interact with our Online Games and Services and other unaffiliated sites in order to identify your browser or device and provide their respective services. Further, these online partners may combine data collected on our Online Games and Services with information collected on unaffiliated sites or with any other data maintained by these online partners. Their use of data collected on our Online Games and Services and third-party sites will be subject to their own terms of use and privacy policies.</p>
<p>For example, we may use third-party cookies to deliver our ads on third-party websites through a common form of online advertising known as "retargeting." Retargeting works by serving ads on one website based on an individual's activities on a different website. To do this, we allow our online partners (such as Google or other ad network vendors) to serve their own third-party cookies when users visit our Online Games and Services, allowing these online partners to recognize users who have previously visited our Online Games and Services. When these users visit a third-party website that includes features provided by our online partners (for example, where our online partners have purchased ad space), our online partners can recognize the users' interest in our products and services and deliver one of our ads on the third-party website.</p>
<strong>Your Cookie Choices</strong>
<p>Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. However, browsers typically allow individuals to remove or block browser cookies if they choose.

<p><strong><em>BY CONTINUING TO USE OUR ONLINE GAMES AND SERVICES, YOU CONSENT TO THE USE OF COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</em></strong>.</p>
<strong>INTERACTION WITH SIGN-IN SERVICES AND SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS</strong>
<p>From time-to-time, our Online Games and Services may allow you to log in using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect, Appleâ€™s Game Center, or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and may provide you the option to share certain personal data with us such as your name, email address, and resume to pre-populate our sign up form. Once your identity has been authenticated, we may collect certain information such as the sign-in service used and a unique identification code associated with the sign-on service.</p>
<p>From time-to-time, our Online Games and Services may also contain functionality which enables you to import profile information or contacts from third party services (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, FourSquare, Instagram, Vine, etc.) (collectively, "<strong>Third Party Social Media Accounts</strong>"). If you choose to do this, you may have to log into the applicable Third Party Social Media Account, using such accountâ€™s user name and password. The copy of the information received by us shall be subject to this Privacy Statement.

All such postings are also subject to the terms of use and privacy policy of the applicable third parties as well as the terms of this Privacy Statement.</p>

These service providers may have access to personal data about you if it is needed to perform their functions for us, but they are not authorized by KingsIsle to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements, and they are required to maintain the information in confidence.</li>
	<li><strong>Social Media.</strong> As discussed in the "Interaction with Sign-In Services and Social Media Accounts" section above, you may have the ability to share information from our Online Games and Services to your Third Party Social Media Accounts. Online Games and Services that allow you to do this use social plugins (e.g., the Facebook "Like" button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit our Online Games and Services, the operator of the social plugin can place a cookie on your computer, enabling that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our Online Games and Services. If you are logged into the Third Party Social Media Account (e.g., Facebook) while browsing on our Online Games and Services, the social plugins allow that social media websites to receive information that you have visited our Online Games and Services.

We may also disclose your information as part of an investigation or enforcement action relating to improper or illegal conduct in connection with our Online Games and Services, including, without limitation, any situations that may potentially involve threats to the safety or privacy of any person, misuse of Online Games and Services or violation of our Terms of Use.</li>

</ul>
<strong>SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN</strong><br>
<strong>Users in the United States</strong>
<p>Except as described below, KingsIsle will not ask children under the age of 13 who register to use our Online Games and Services hereafter to submit any personal data. The only information requested from children under 13 will be a username and a user password. We may also ask such users to answer one or more security questions that do not request personal data. PLEASE NOTE: it is critical that users under the age of 13 retain their passwords because KingsIsle may not be able to reset the passwords when we have not collected a user or parental e-mail address.</p>
<p>If it becomes necessary to collect personal data from children under 13, KingsIsle will only do so after obtaining verifiable parental consent, as defined under COPPA, or as otherwise permitted under COPPA. For example, COPPA permits collection of personal data where (i) the sole purpose of collecting online contact information from a child is to respond directly on a one-time basis to a specific request from the child, and where such information is not used to re-contact the child or for any other purpose; (ii) the purpose of collecting a childâ€™s and a parentâ€™s name and online contact information is to protect the safety of a child; or (iii) KingsIsle collects online contact information of the childâ€™s parent or guardian to obtain parental consent or to provide voluntary notice and/or updates to the parent or guardian about participation in our Online Games and Services.</p>
<p>On our Online Games and Services, we offer many features, such as the ability to view or download game content or images, news, or participate in forums, which do not require a child to provide any personal data. KingsIsle will not condition a childâ€™s participation in any online activity on the childâ€™s disclosure of more personal data than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. We also may enable users to chat online through our Online Games and Services, but we take measures to limit usersâ€™ ability to communicate personal data through this chat function.</p>
<strong>Parental Review of Personal Data</strong>
<p>In certain circumstances on some of our Online Games and Services, parents will have the ability to set up parental accounts to administer their childrenâ€™s accounts and review the personally data maintained by KingsIsle from such accounts. Parents or guardians may establish a parental account during the initial registration process for the childâ€™s account or, subsequently, through the account management features applicable to the childâ€™s account. Although a child over the age of 13 may register without the electronic consent of a parent or guardian, a parent or guardian may also submit a request to KingsIsle at the contact information below to review any personally data from such child. However, such requests will be subject to the parent or guardian demonstrating proper identification to KingsIsleâ€™s satisfaction after reasonable investigation</p>
<strong>Users located in Europe</strong>

If you believe that a minor of whom you are a parent or guardian has provided us with personal data, please contact us at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:Privacy@KingsIsle.com">Privacy@KingsIsle.com</a> and we will make reasonable efforts to remove all personal related to the minor.</p>
