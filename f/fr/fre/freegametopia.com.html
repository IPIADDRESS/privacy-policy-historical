Having said that, this is also a great chance to find some new favorites as well as return to old classics. Even if you generally dedicate most time to playing classic games such as the Sonic the Hedgehog game and Space Invaders then you should considering making some time to get playing entirely new games, many of whose names will presumably be completely unknown to you before you come across them here.

If you haven’t played the Sleepless Knight series, for example, then this is a chance to find out all about these games and enjoy a different sort of online challenge. You might just find a new personal favorite which you just can’t enough of, or a number of games which you would like to divide your playing time between.

So why not give a few of these games a go and see if you can find something to keep you entertained in the evenings and take your mind off all of the more difficult things in life? Although getting started is as easy as we mentioned, the only problem might be getting around to switching off your PC. ">Casual Games</a>

What kinds of thing can bring great memories of our youth flooding back to us? The sound of an old song or the taste of some good old fashioned home cooking? An old movie on the TV or the sight of someone you hadn’t seen for years? Now we can add classic games onto that list too.

There are some arcade games which are just so amazingly good that the mere sight of them or mention of their name is enough to transport us mentally to that amusement arcade of our youth where we spent long hours with our friends trying to beat that elusive high score. Here are a few of our best classic games which probably hold special memories for you too.

Sonic game. Who can forget this fantastic character who ran and jumped his way into our hearts with his series of all action games? Many of us played this game over and over again on home consoles without ever tiring of it. Now we have chance with free Sonic games online to find out if it still as good as ever. Would you bet against it?   

Space Invaders game. Another of those classics which never seem to age is Space Invaders. Would you have imagined the first time that you played it that it would have carried on being as popular so many years later? The gameplay is simple, the action is brilliant and the addictiveness levels go through the roof; just what you want from a classic arcade game.
 
Pacman arcade game. If we are talking about games which never age then the best example of all is probably this one. With the chance to play Pacman free online we can now enjoy the timeless good vs. evil battle of round blob against colored ghost type creatures all over again.    

Frogger game. How many of the world’s best ever arcade games have been as cunningly simple as this one? You take a little amphibian and help him cross a danger filled road and stream in order to reach his home. If you haven’t been given the opportunity to play Frogger for a while you may very well be taken back by the stunning way in which it grips you again and just doesn’t let go.
  
Asteroids game. What more can we say about this all time classic space game. The rocks keep on coming and you need to keep on thrusting and shooting. This is one of those games which come loaded with a whole load of memories for many of us, and playing the Asteroids game online is almost like wandering back in time a decade or two.

Apart from these wonderful games you will find plenty more here that you have half forgotten about, as well as a few you probably never had the chance to play the first time around. Zombie Invader, Dodo Hunt and Stone Breaker are among some of the games you may not have played before which you could very easily get hooked on if you give them a try.

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-5"><a href="http://www.freegametopia.com/free-online-games/category/puzzles/" title="Choose Puzzle Games to Give Your Brain Some Exercise

Once you have smashed up some big rocks on Asteriods and had a battle with those ghosts on the Pacman arcade game you might want to have a go at something which stimulates other parts of your brain.

This is where taking a step back from the all action arcade games and having a look at some brain teasing puzzle games can give you a completely different type of entertainment which is just as satisfying.  Magic Orbs, Crush the Castle and Monkey Metric are just some of the games you will find on here which require you to keep your wits about in order to play them well.

Most of these games may be new to you right now but there are plenty which will keep you coming back over and over again to see if you can solve the fiendish puzzles and advance further than before. The beauty of these puzzle games is that they are simple to get started on but as the level increases you will find them more and more difficult to progress on. To win on these games you need a big dollop of patience as well as a lot of brain power, and if you can manage it then the feeling of satisfaction is immense.

If you are big fan of card games then you might very well be tempted by Solitaire, while simple yet addictive games such as Words and Numbers will keep you scratching your head for hours on end. Another idea is to look at the famous Chinese puzzle game called Mah Jong. This classic has been popular for centuries and here you can have a go at the game which, according to the legend, was invented by Confucius and which has left so many people beaten over the years.

As well as being interesting games for adults there are also some which are recommended for youngsters. If you are fed up seeing your child playing the Sonic the Hedgehog game all day long then you can encourage him to diversify his game playing with some of these brain stretching puzzles.

Another great use for this type of free online entertainment is when you feel as though your brain is ticking over too much in the evening to let you get to sleep. If you have problems or concerns on your mind then focusing your energies on finding the smart way to solve these games is one fantastic way to concentrate on something else and let your worries melt away.

Of course, once you have finished with these mind games you might want to go back and shoot some more aliens or help that little frog cross the road in the Frogger game. That’s the great thing about these online games being free; you can jump back and forward between the different ones whenever you feel like a change. However, once you find a few favorite puzzle games and get hooked on them we are sure you will keep coming back for more until you crack them once and for all.

When you get home and want to take out some of your tension or frustration then your dog will be delighted that you have found these free online shooter games.

Some of the best arcade games ever made were built on the simple premise that human begins like to shoot at things, and this is place where you will find lots of chances to do just that.

If we are going to talk about shooter games then you will probably be expecting to see Asteroids here, and you won’t be disappointed. The Asteroids arcade game was an absolute revelation when it came out way back in 1979 and now it is free to play online any time you want. If you were a big fan of this game before then this is a super chance to remember what made it so special, and if you have never played it before then you are in for a treat.

Having said that, if you are in the mood for something new and fresh you might decide to leave the Asteroids online game for later and have a look at something different. Names like Zombie Rampage and Tank Patrol should be enough to give you an idea of the kind of shooting fun which is to be had by playing them.
 
If you like to shoot and fly at the same time then Battle Over Berlin and Sky Chopper are a couple of recommended ways of having some sky high fun which will take your breath away. Anyone looking for a bit of cute shooting fun might like to have a go at the hilarious, monkey filled Milky Shoot or the cute but deadly Mad Cows.

Urban Sniper and Urban Sniper 2 give you a chance to test out how steady your aim is under pressure, while Lucky Boot is a cheeky little game which will have you throwing shoes all day long.

The best thing about these cool shooting games is that they are so much fun that they will have you coming back for more time and time again. Whenever you feel like a change from blowing up tanks to shooting down spacecraft you just need to hop onto a different game and get a different sort of adrenalin rush. The sheer variety of different types of shooting scenarios on offer means that you could try out a few new games every day and still be coming back for more.

If you want to survive more than a few seconds in these games you will need to have fast reflexes and good aim, as the action tends to be pretty fast and furious. This is part of their charm and what makes them an enormously effective way to blow off your cobwebs and make you forget about everything else that has gone on during the rest of the day. For a few hours all that matters is how many zombies or soldiers you are able to gun down in as short a time as possible, and we can’t ask for much more than that from a game, can we?

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-7"><a href="http://www.freegametopia.com/free-online-games/category/sports-games/" title="Online Sports Games with Added Fun

Whatever type of sport you love you can now find it online. In fact, sometimes even sports which we aren’t that keen on in real life can be a lot more enticing on the internet than down at the local sports center or stadium.

A lot of online games players stick to arcade classics such as free Space Invaders and free online Pacman games. These are great games without any doubt, and you will find them on this site too, but sometimes a change of scene with a sports challenge can be an exciting way to keep your internet playing interesting.

When it comes down to the different sports on offer soccer fans are spoiled for choice of course. From the cool graphics of Kick Ups and the nonstop action of Emo Soccer to the fun Keep Ups 2 there are a number of ways to get the ball rolling and enjoy this internationally popular game. 

Bike racing is another kind of sport which has traditionally been well represented in PC games, and here the choice is pretty awesome. Dirt Bike 5, Manic Rider and Dirt Bike Championship are among the many top ways to get racing and enjoy the thrills and the spills of a high octane competition where one wrong move can see you splayed on the ground. 

Another type of sport which we enjoy seeing online when it is a well thought out game is boxing, and Hot Blood Boxing really hits the spot for us.  For something even more action packed Muay Thai is one to look out for as well.

Medieval Golf and Fog Golf are two interesting takes on the classic PC golfing game which are well worth having a go at, while other sports such as cricket, pool, table tennis and show jumping are also well represented along with a large number of others. In fact, there are very few mainstream sports which aren’t covered here by at least one fun game.

As you can see from just a brief run through of a selection of the games on offer, many of them take the idea of a sports game and add in a fascinating, off the wall element to make it even more fun to play. Go Santa is one of our favorites in this respect and even if you aren’t sure if sports games are for you or not you will find plenty of ideas here which you will have fun trying out and which might just hook you in.

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-8"><a href="http://www.freegametopia.com/free-online-games/category/strategy-games/" title="Take Your Tactics onto the Next Level

Online strategy games cover a wider variety of types of game than you might think, and having a quick look at some of these will show you that the description covers a large number of different sorts of games.

Basically, strategy games are those which require you to come up with tactics and to make decisions as you progress. This rather broad definition means that you can such varied games as Coffee Shop, War Machines and Pig Wars in this section

War games always make up a high percentage of the most popular strategy games around, and here we have rounded up some of the very best ones for you to prove your leadership material on. Stalingrad, Ultimate War and Tower Defence are all based on the idea of attacking the enemy or defending your empire from them in the smartest possible way.

Tactical games set in outer space are always sought after too, and here we have the likes of STAR Defense and Stormwinds which let you battle to take control of a bigger share of the universe.    

If you prefer something a bit less violent and confrontational then some classic games such as Master Checkers, Knockers, Ludo and Beat the Banker let you use your brain to good effect without anyone getting hurt in the process.

For some cute and lovable action Conquer Antarctic is a winner, while Youda Farmer gives you something completely unique. As you can see, there are lots of ways to get some fun out these intelligent games and all you need to do is decide which ones most interest you.

If you are used to fast moving arcade games such as Frogger and the free Asteroids game then you might find that the transition to these slower moving but generally more complex ones takes you a bit of time. However, it is worth it, as you will discover a whole new world of entertainment which you can take advantage of whenever you feel like a change of pace.

These games are, on the whole, a little bit longer and more complex to play then arcade shooting games. That doesn’t mean that they are too difficult to pick up but it does mean that it is worth setting aside a bit of time to really get involved in them and work your way through the different levels. If you get really hooked on strategy games then you will be able to spend hours planning and carrying out your tactics, and some players like to set aside a whole evening where they settle down in front of the their PC with some snacks and enjoy the depth and quality which this kind of online fun can give you.     

If you find that some of these games are just what you were looking for then you might like to give all or most of them a try. You will find that even though the scenarios and characters change greatly a really good strategy game always has the same sort of basic challenge at the heart of it.
