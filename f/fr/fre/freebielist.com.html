                misused over the Internet. The vast majority of Web sites will 
                at some point ask you to provide your e-mail address and/or other 
                personal information. This privacy statement, produced independently 
                by FreebieList.com (<a href="http://www.freebielist.com/"><font color="#000080">http://www.freebielist.com</font></a>),

                purposes and never distribute it to third parties. The sections 
                below explain how we use the information collected.</font></p>
