<h3 align="center" style="text-align:center"><font face="Arial">Advice
Company Privacy Statement</font></h3>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">FreeAdvice.com
is a unit of the Advice Company, and has created this privacy statement in order
to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our
information gathering and dissemination practices for the FreeAdvice.com
website. 
Questions
regarding this statement should be directed to the Webmaster by emailing <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial"><a href="mailto:admin@adviceco.com">admin@adviceco.com</a>
</span>
</font></p>

 <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial">

<h4><font face="Arial"> Advice
Company Privacy Policy</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial"> Advice
Company is a leading provider of information and advice on the Internet and
e-commerce solutions for individuals and businesses. We invite you to explore
our Web site and find out what all the talk is about.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial"> Information
this Site Gathers/Tracks

</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial"> The Advice
Companys Web site logs IP addresses and browser types, but we do not link IP
addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a users
session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> You can
browse our site without entering any personal information and therefore remain
anonymous during your visit. However, we hope that all of our visitors will
register with us so that we can learn more about our valuable customers and keep
them updated with our monthly newsletter. Our registration form asks users for
name, email address, preferences, and various types of demographic information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> We
encourage all visitors to register with Advice Company. Your name and email
address are used to send you our newsletter containing news about the subjects
you and fellow readers have asked us about. If you would rather not receive the newsletter, but
would still like to register, please indicate your preference by marking the
appropriate box presented on the registration form. Occasionally, we like to
present you with special offers from our partners. This involves sharing your
information with them so they can send you the offer. If you prefer, you can
choose that your information not be shared with our partners by indicating your
preference on the registration form. Preferences and demographic information is
used to help us improve our service and products. The more we know about you,
the better we can serve you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> Visitors
may choose to voluntarily "Sign In", or request our Free online
newsletter, use the Tell a Friend feature, complete a Visitor Survey, enter our
contests, request information from us, or choose to use the FreeAdvice Live!
feature. If so, we may on our own behalf send you Email, copies of our Free
newsletters or surveys. (We would delete your Email address on request.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> If
you choose to request a Consultation from an attorney listed on AttorneyPages'
Lawyer Directory, you may do so directly by telephone, by fax, by mail or by
using the online Request Form. As the Request Form states, you should NOT send
any attorney any confidential information until and unless the attorney asks you
to do so.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> If
you choose to use the online Request Form, your message is typically transmitted
directly to the attorney by Email or through an independent provider's
"Email to Fax service". We can take no responsibility for the
transmission or delivery of any such message. A copy of most messages sent via
the Request Form is sent to our archives, where it may be used on a confidential
basis solely for Advice Companys own purposes, such as to determine traffic
flow, attorney responsiveness or visitor satisfaction. Advice Company will
maintain the confidentiality of any request from its end of the Internet to the
fullest extent permitted by law.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> If
a visitor, within a short period of time, sends multiple copies of a similar
message using a Request Form, or tries to evade our programs designed to prevent
the sending of multiple messages, our systems or staff may alert us and/or some
or all of the attorneys to that fact to enable the attorneys to take that into
account in determining whether or not to reply or grant a Consultation. We may
also bar the visitor from future use of the Websites or any of its features.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> FreeAdvice.com
and AttorneyPages.com NEVER require reports from attorneys on who contacts them
through our Websites, or who becomes a client, or the nature or specifics of any
matter. FreeAdvice.com and AttorneyPages.com are publishers, and not "legal
referral bureaus" nor law firms, and NEVER receive any portion of any
attorneys fees should you become a client of any attorney.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> The
only other place that we collect personal information on our Web site is on the
order forms, which ask for billing information such as name, postal address,
email address and credit card number should you decide to place an order online.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial"> Use of the
Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial"> The Advice
Company Web site logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes and these
logs are analyzed to constantly improve the value of the materials available on
the website.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial"> Surveys,
Bulletin Boards and FreeAdvice Live!

</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial"> <span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Our
online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their email address)
and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use
contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company.
Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This information is
shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.</span> 

</font></p>
 <span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
<h4><font face="Arial">Posting
information on the </font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial"> Our
FreeAdvice Live! feature allows visitors to chat directly with a<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> an Advice Company participating professional. Visitors can
sign on using an assumed name, but if they do identify themselves, by giving
their email, name, address or other identifying information, the Company may use
that information to contact you.</span></font></p>
 <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> 
<p><font face="Arial">The
Company maintains special relationships, such as "Powered by CommTouch"
and Powered by LivePerson with various partners, business partners, and
operated several co-branded sites. The operators of the co-branded sites may
gather additional information; the Company sometimes has access to some or all
of the information, and the Companys partners use of the information is
not within the Companys control.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial"> Advice
Company Order Form</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial"> The
information that we require on our order form is only used to process your order
quickly and accurately. Your contact information will only be used to send you
the product that you purchase and your billing information will only be used to
bill you for that product. This information may be used for marketing purposes
by Advice Company. <span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when
necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the
choice/opt-out section below.</span></font></p>
 <span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
<h4><font face="Arial"> Sharing of
the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial"> For those
visitors who register with Advice Company, we share your name, email address,
preferences, and demographic information with select partners so they can
present you with special offers. Though, as mentioned above, you may tell us
that you dont want your information shared, in which case we will of course
respect your wishes. Please see the Opt-out section below.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> The
information that you submit on the order form (contact and billing information)
is never shared with any third parties, including our partners.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial"> Security</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial"> When you
place an order online, your personal information and credit card information are
scrambled using encryption technology before being sent over the Internet. This
makes it virtually impossible for your information to be stolen or intercepted
while being transferred through cyberspace. When we receive your order, it is
kept encrypted until we're ready to process it. In addition, we erase your
credit card information from our web site database so it isnt connected to</font> <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial"><font face="Arial"> the Internet, and is therefore safe from
"hackers."</font></span></p>
<h4><font face="Arial"> Links</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">Advice Company websites contain links to other Web sites.
Please be aware that our privacy policy does not apply to these linked sites. We
encourage you to read the posted privacy statement whenever interacting with any
Web site.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial"> Cookies

</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial"> Our site
uses cookies to keep track of items in your shopping cart and to provide our
visitors with a tailored user experience. With the help of cookies, we can
present you with customized content and ads that will be of more interest to
you. We also use cookies in our bbs-forums to remember your passwords for you so you dont have
to re-enter them each time you visit the site. You have the option of setting your browser to reject cookies. However, if certain
cookies that track your purchase are rejected then we won't be able to keep
items in your cart.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial"> Advertiser
Cookies

</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial"> You may be
served cookies from our advertisers or advertising agencies while visiting our
site. We do not control, nor do we have access to any of the information they
may collect.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial"> Opt-out
Policy</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial"> If at any
time after registering, you change your mind about receiving the newsletter or
sharing your information with third parties, you may send your requests to:
Advice Company Privacy Manager, admin@adviceco.com</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial"> Correcting/Updating
</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial"> If you would
like to correct and/or update your registration information, please contact:
Advice Company Customer Services, <a href="mailto:admin@adviceco.com">admin@adviceco.com</a></font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">General Advice</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">Finally,
although Advice Company has a very strong Privacy Protection policy on our end,
and does its utmost to protect privacy of all visitors, we bear no
responsibility for anyone elses conduct with respect to material you
transmit. As is true with ANY Internet usage and access to ANY Website, if you
are using someone elses computer, or someone else has access to your
computer, or you are using a corporate or other "network", it may be
possible for that "someone else" or the "network" operator
to retrieve copies of Email you sent from the computer and/or to trace the
places you have been visiting on the Internet.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Amendments</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial"> We may
amend this Privacy Policy on a prospective basis (i.e., for future visits) at
any time by posting a revised policy on our Web site. Further, nothing in this
Privacy Policy is designed to protect the privacy of visitors whose use of the
Companys Websites is, in the reasonable opinion of Advice Company or its
attorneys, intended for illegal, improper or abusive purposes, for purposes of
marketing or solicitation, or would violate any other terms and conditions
relating to use of the Web site. This FreeAdvice.com Privacy statement is
effective November 7, 1999.</font></p>
