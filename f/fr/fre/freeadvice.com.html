<h2>Privacy Statement for FreeAdvice.com</h2>

<p>Management of FreeAdvice.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our 

  firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering 

  and dissemination practices for the FreeAdvice.com website. Questions regarding 

  this statement should be directed to the Officer named below by emailing <a href="mailto:admin@adviceco.com">admin@adviceco.com</a></p>

  <p>FreeAdvice, recognized as a leading consumer and small business legal website, 

    is a unit of Advice Company (Advice &amp; Counsel Incorporated), a leading 

    provider of information and advice on the Internet and E-commerce solutions 

    for individuals and small businesses. We invite you to explore our Web site 

    and find out what all the talk is about.</p>

  <h3><b><font face="Arial">Information this Site Gathers/Tracks </font></b></h3>

<p>We collect aggregate information site-wide, including anonymous site stats. 

  We also log domain names and/or IP addresses. On certain pages we give users 

  the option of providing us with names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, 

  email addresses, demographic, preference and other personal information, and 

  various other kinds of details. Such personal information is not gathered by 

  us without users` knowing and active permission and participation. </p>

<p>Portions of our site use ?cookies? to keep track of your visit, to help you 

  navigate between sections, thus delivering content specific to your interests 

  and to give us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do 

  not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a 

  user?s session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous. A cookie is 

  a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit 

  them.&nbsp; A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the 

  site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information 

  a cookie contains is information you supply yourself. A cookie does not&nbsp; 

  read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. </p>

<p>Most of our site does not require that visitors complete a registration form 

  or give us contact information (such as a name and email address) to visit. 

  Our Bulletin Boards do not require that visitors register or use their actual 

  names to post questions or to provide answers, although those who do register 

  receive certain benefits, such as automatic email notification of responses 

  and edit privileges. Visitors may also register for our Email newsletters. However, 

  we require visitors to register and identify themselves when using our one on 

  one chat feature, FreeAdvice Live! We use customer contact information from 

  the registration form to send the user information about our site and our company. 

  We reserve the right to use customer contact information to contact a visitor 

  when we deem it necessary or appropriate. Users may opt-out of receiving future 

  mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.</p>

<p>This site contains links to other sites. FreeAdvice.com is not responsible 

  for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.</p>

<p>Certain portions of our site are also the result of special relationships, 

  such as "Powered By" or Co-branding or affiliate programs. For example, 

  we provide a Free Email feature in cooperation with CommTouch, a Bookstore in 

  affiliation with Amazon.com, and Legal Forms in conjunction with US Legal Forms. 

  These firms share varying amounts of information with us. You should review 

  the privacy policies of such providers.</p>

<p>Certain portions of our site may provide a form for customers to request or 

  share or distribute information, or order products or services. We collect visitor's 

  contact information (like their email address) and, if they are making a credit 

  card purchase, financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). 

  Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information 

  about our Web site and our company to our customers. The customer's contact 

  information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when we believe it 

  is necessary or appropriate. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; 

  see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected 

  is used to bill the user for products and services.</p>

<p>Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) 

  and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We 

  use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our Web 

  site and company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact 

  the visitor when we believe it is necessary or appropriate. Users may opt-out 

  of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic 

  and profile data is also collected at our site. This information is shared with 

  advertisers on an aggregate basis.</p>

  companies to display ads on our site.&nbsp; We work with several unaffiliated 

  companies that serve ads.&nbsp; These ads may contain cookies. While we use 

  cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are

  to this information. To find out more about how these sites have told us they
