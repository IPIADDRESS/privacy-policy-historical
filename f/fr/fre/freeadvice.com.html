<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FreeAdvice, recognized as the Number 
  1 Legal Website for consumers and small businesses, respects the privacy of 
  visitors to our site. FreeAdvice.com is a unit of Advice Company (Advice &amp; 
  Counsel Incorporated), a leading provider of information and advice and E-commerce 
  solutions on the Internet. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please read this Privacy Policy so 
  that you can understand how we seek to enforce our firm commitment to privacy. 
  Questions regarding this statement should be directed to the Officer named below 
  by emailing <a href="mailto:admin@adviceco.com">admin@adviceco.com</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We invite you to explore FreeAdvice.com 
  and its affiliated Websites, including <a href="http://www.attorneypages.com/">www.AttorneyPages.com</a> 
  and <a href="http://www.expertpages.com/">www.ExpertPages.com</a> and <a href="http://www.doityourself.com/">www.DoItYourself.com</a>.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Information this Site Gathers / 
  Tracks </font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The information gathered by Advice 
  Company falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors 
  to our websites when they register or initiate transactions, and (2) tracking 
  information gathered as visitors navigate through our sites. Third party providers 
  featured on or linked to from our websites, such as vendors of products and 
  services offered through our sites, may be gathering the same kinds of information. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To help make our sites more responsive 
  to the needs of our visitors, help you navigate between sections, tailor content 
  to your needs and to measure traffic within our sites, our web servers automatically 
  collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, 
  including your IP address, when you visit our sites. They also invoke a standard 
  feature of browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each visitor 
  a unique, random number, a sort of user ID, which resides on your computer. 
  The cookie helps give us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting 
  and doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor 
  uses to access our site. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unless you voluntarily identify yourself 
  (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign 
  a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain 
  is information you supply. Our cookies can't read unrelated data from your computer. 
  Our advertisers and the third parties that provide products or services through 
  our sites may also assign their own cookies to your browser, but we don't control 
  their cookies or their processes, and they do not regularly share information 
  they gather with us. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To make use of certain features on 
  our websites (such as free email, personal web pages, our ask a lawyer live 
  chat, bulletin boards and other interactive forums) visitors need to register 
  and to provide certain information as part of the registration process. We may 
  also ask for information from those who buy products or services or conduct 
  other transactions on our websites. We may ask, for example, for your name, 
  email address, street address, sex, age, city or town, zip code (and for those 
  who seek to purchase a product or service, credit card number), and we sometimes 
  request information on your interest in other topics. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The information you supply may help 
  us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our sites to your interests 
  and make them more useful to you, and to process e-commerce transactions. Of 
  course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're still free to 
  take advantage of the wealth of content available on our sites without registration. <span style="font-family:
Arial">
  The vast majority of our site does NOT require visitors to complete a registration 
  form or give us contact information (such as a name and email address) to visit. 
  </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The more we know about our visitors 
  the more value we can potentially offer them. Supplying such information is 
  entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply the information we require, we may 
  be unable to provide you with services we make available to other visitors to 
  our sites. For example, while we allow anyone to read postings in our Bulletin 
  Board / Forums without registration, asking a question or furnishing an answer 
  requires registration, which enables visitors to modify their own posts. Our 
  one-on-one live chat feature, FreeAdvice Live! also requires a separate registration. 
  And we can't send you targeted email alerting you to a relevant new service 
  we're offering, or articles on topics of interest to you, if you don't tell 
  us what you're interested in and give us your email address. Similarly, we can't 
  notify you that you've been lucky enough to win a prize in a promotional contest 
  if we don't know how to contact you. Such personal information is gathered by 
  us only with our users` knowing and active permission and participation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our online surveys and contests ask 
  visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic 
  information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Demographic and profile 
  data collected at our site may be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We collect financial information 
  (like an account or credit card numbers) only from visitors making a credit 
  card or other purchase. We use the financial information solely to bill the 
  user for products and services and necessary information from the order form 
  to send orders. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also use customer contact information 
  from the various registration forms, opt in features and service features to 
  send the user information about our site, our company and our affiliates. Users 
  may opt-out of receiving routine future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section 
  below</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As this privacy policy reaffirms, 
  we strive to protect confidentiality for our visitors. We do reserve the right 
  to use customer contact and other information when we deem it necessary or appropriate 
  to comply with applicable laws, rules, or lawful orders of courts and governmental 
  agencies, to enforce compliance with the terms and conditions for use of our 
  sites, or to protect third parties from what we regard as threats of serious 
  harm. </font></p>
