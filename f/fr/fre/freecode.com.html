We may also use Aggregated Information to inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked through links to their websites. With respect to polls, we will treat information provided by you in accordance with this section and Section F (Polls &amp; Sweepstakes) below. Circumstances under which we would publicly disclose such Aggregated Information include, but are not limited to, sharing poll results on the Sites, providing data to our advertisers on user preferences and/or demographics, and publicizing overall usage data in press communications. Where polls allow users to submit written comments, and where we advise users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the poll, we reserve the right to disclose and/or commercially exploit any information provided by users, provided that no Personal Information identifying a specific user is disclosed.

<ul>
 	<li>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #212121;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The first one is our legitimate interests, which we weigh against any risks to your rights. By “legitimate interests,” we mean the ordinary needs and objectives of a business that offers the types of services available on our Sites, including security, quality assurance (such as preventing the dissemination or malware and misuse of our Sites and services), customer service, communicating with users to better serve them, and improving and developing new products and services. </span></span></span></p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #212121;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The second one is when processing is necessary to enter into or perform a contract with you.</span></span></span></p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #212121;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The third basis is consent – you will know when we are relying on consent because we will have expressly asked you for your consent (and if you don’t give us consent, we won’t perform the processing in question). &nbsp;Also, the sections titled “How we use Personal Information” and “How we share information we gather” flag the uses that are based on consent by marking them with an asterisk.</span></span></span></p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #212121;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">We may also process your Personal Information on the basis that we need to do so to fulfill our legal obligations. We expect this would be a rare situation.</span></span></span></p>
