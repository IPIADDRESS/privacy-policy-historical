		  <p align="center">PRIVACY POLICY</p>
		  </b>
		  <p>Last Updated: June 1, 2012</p>
		  <p>FreeAffiliateInsider strives to offer its visitors the many 
		  advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and 
		  personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable 
		  Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone 
		  number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. "</p>
		  <b>
		  <p>How we gather information from users</p>
		  </b>
		  <p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are 
		  visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the 
		  services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide 
		  information when you register for access to certain portions of our 
		  site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make 
		  a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in 
		  sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other 
		  interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, 
		  FreeAffiliateInsider.Com also collects information automatically and 
		  through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our 
		  visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service 
		  Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold 
		  information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store 
		  your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that 
		  information each time you visit, or may control the number of times 
		  you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As 
		  we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through 
		  other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with 
		  information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept 
		  cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of 
		  the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and 
		  we may not be able to customize the site’s features according to your 
		  preferences.</p>
		  <b>
		  <p>What we do with the information we collect</p>
		  </b>
		  <p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your 
		  visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising.</p>
		  <p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally 
		  identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine 
		  information about your usage patterns with similar information 
		  obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., 
		  to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most 
		  attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with 
		  our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does 
		  not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow 
		  anyone to identify you individually.  We reserve the right to sell, rent, and/or share a visitor/consumer’s Personally Identifiable Information to any third party for marketing purposes</p>
		  <p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on 
		  FreeAffiliateInsider.Com to communicate with you about your 
		  registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and 
		  privacy policy; services and products offered by 
		  FreeAffiliateInsider.Com and other topics we think you might find of 
		  interest. We may also share your information with third party marketing partners. Marketing communications may include direct mail, telemarketing, SMS and email. </p>
		  <p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by 
		  FreeAffiliateInsider.Com may also be used for other purposes, 
		  including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, 
		  processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes 
		  and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties 
		  who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web 
		  hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use 
		  your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to 
		  time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge 
		  or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, 
		  user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also 
		  disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times 
		  when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in 
		  connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to 
		  law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or 
		  necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to 
		  disclosure in such cases.</p>
		  <b>
		  <p>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</p>
		  </b>
		  <p>FreeAffiliateinsider.Com expects its partners, advertisers and 
		  affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, 
		  that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates 
		  and other content providers accessible through our site, may have 
		  their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For 
		  example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as 
		  part of a frame on a FreeAffiliateInsiderr.Com page, certain content 
		  that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through 
		  FreeAffiliateInsider.Com you may be introduced to, or be able to 
		  access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes 
		  offered by other parties. FreeAffiliateInsider.Com is not responsible 
		  for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check 
		  the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing 
		  information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>
		  <p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other 
		  third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to 
		  identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. 
		  For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and 
		  may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether 
		  you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features 
		  available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and 
		  may use cookies or other technology to gather information. 
		  FreeAffiliateInsider.Com does not control the use of this technology 
		  by third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible 
		  for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
		  <p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose 
		  Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat 
		  areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected 
		  and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in 
		  unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such 
		  activities are beyond the control of FreeAffiliateInsider.Com and 
		  this policy.</p>
