		<h5>FreeWheel Media, Inc. Privacy Statement</h5>
		<p>
	Effective Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; July 18, 2011</p>
<p>
	This privacy statement (this “Statement”) describes the types of information that FreeWheel Media, Inc. (“FreeWheel” or “we”) collects from users of its corporate Web site (<a href="http://www.freewheel.tv/">www.freewheel.tv</a>) and the Web site that its customers use to access the services FreeWheel provides to its customers.&nbsp; This Statement also describes the services that we provide to our customers, including our hosted solution that enables our customers to manage and monetize online video advertising (the "Services"). &nbsp;This Statement also contains our end user opt-out mechanism. &nbsp;Unless otherwise provided in this Statement, this Statement does not cover our offline data practices.</p>
<p>
	This Statement is effective as of the date set forth above.&nbsp; We encourage you to check this Statement from time to time. &nbsp;If we make material changes that will affect any personal information that we have already collected from you, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the changes and to give you the opportunity to opt out. &nbsp;Your continued use of this Web Site constitutes your acceptance of the current posted privacy policy. If you have questions about our privacy policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@freewheel.tv">privacy@freewheel.tv</a>.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Privacy policy for the FreeWheel Web Sites</strong></p>
<p>
	You can visit and navigate through our main, corporate Web Site (<a href="http://www.freewheel.tv/">www.freewheel.tv</a>) to gather information about our company and Services without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information.&nbsp; We use “Cookies” (described below) in connection with a Web Site analytics service that helps us better understand how our visitors use this Web Site.&nbsp; We review the information provided by this use of cookies to better understand how our visitors navigate through this Web Site, to learn what content is being reviewed, and to administer this Web Site.&nbsp; We collect no information that personally identifies you through our use of these cookies. &nbsp;You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie so you have the chance to accept it and/or can set your browser to turn off cookies.</p>
<p>
	You may wish to request information about our Services or our company. &nbsp;In order to facilitate the distribution of this content, you will be asked to provide information that could identify you personally, such as your name, company, title, phone number, e-mail address, site name, URL, and address. &nbsp;Based on the nature of your request, FreeWheel may also ask for additional information, such as number of page views your site receives, how you anticipate you will make use of our products and services, and how you heard about us.&nbsp; Again, all of this information is provided by you on a voluntary basis only and is not required in order for you to use and enjoy our corporate We Site.</p>
<p>
	If you are a customer, you will be required to enter certain information that can identify you personally (such as username and password) in order to access our user interface (www.mrm.freewheel.tv).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	FreeWheel may use the information that you provide to us to contact you to further discuss your interest in our company and our Services, and to send information regarding our company or partners (such as marketing promotions and events). &nbsp;This information may also be used to improve the Services we provide you. &nbsp;The information is collected and stored in a manner that is appropriate for the nature of the data that we collect and the need to fulfill your request. &nbsp;This information is not shared with third parties for their own use, unless you specifically authorize such sharing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	When we are contacted via email, we answer by sending an email response to the sender. &nbsp;We also store the email we receive for archival purposes and for our own marketing purposes if we feel that it is consistent with the nature of the inquiry. &nbsp;We will not use return email addresses for any other purpose unless you give us permission to do so.</p>
<p>
	We may in connection with our Web Sites use the services of third parties (i.e., technology consultants, CRM vendors, etc.), who may, in the course of providing services to us, be given access to the information you have provided to us.&nbsp; Each of these service providers iscontractually obligated to provide services to us in a manner consistent with this Statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Our Web Sites may contain links to other Web Sites, such as those of our customers and partners.&nbsp; FreeWheel is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.</p>
<p>
	<strong>FreeWheel’s Provision of Services to Customers</strong></p>
<p>
	FreeWheel is an application services provider, meaning that we host a software application that our customers access via the worldwide web. &nbsp;Each customer understands that in the course of providing Services to it, we collect or receive information from the Web browsers of individuals that are either visiting such customer’s Web site(s) or viewing such customer’s content.&nbsp; This information includes frequency of ads delivered, time, browser type and version, and visitor’s operating system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	None of this information that we collect and store on our customers’ behalf can identify an individual person.&nbsp; As between FreeWheel and its customer, all of such information belongs to the customer, not FreeWheel. &nbsp;FreeWheel does not allow individual information collected and stored for one customer to be accessed by any other FreeWheel customer.&nbsp; Further, FreeWheel may use such information only as provided in its agreement with its customer.&nbsp; We do, however, reserve a limited right to disclose any data we collect if required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority.</p>
<p>
	We require each of our customers to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations that are applicable to their use of our Services, and we promise each customer that we will do the same with respect to our provision of Services. &nbsp;We ask each customer to post a privacy policy that covers our Services and to maintain all necessary rights to allow us to provide the Services, including without limitation to receive the information that we collect and store on such customer’s behalf.&nbsp; We also require each customer to permit no personally identifiable information to be sent to us.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Cookies and End User Opt Out</strong></p>
<p>
	Cookies are files that Web servers place on an Internet user’s computer that are designed to store basic information. &nbsp;FreeWheel uses a cookie in connection with its provision of Services.&nbsp; This cookie does not store any personally-identifiable information and is not otherwise used to provide your identity; it merely is used to recognize your browser.&nbsp; FreeWheel’s cookie is not specific to any of FreeWheel’s individual customers.&nbsp; Accordingly, if you choose to opt-out of FreeWheel’s cookie for any FreeWheel customer, you will be opted out for all of the Web sites and content providers that use FreeWheel’s Services. &nbsp;If you do not want a unique cookie from FreeWheel, there is a simple procedure to follow. &nbsp;<a href="http://cue.v.fwmrm.net/ad/optout">Click here to replace your unique FreeWheel cookie with an opt-out FreeWheel cookie</a>.</p>
<p>
	If you select a FreeWheel opt-out cookie, ads delivered to your browser on behalf of customers using FreeWheel’s ad-serving technology will be targeted based only on the non-personally-identifiable information that is automatically transmitted in the Internet environment when an ad request is received by FreeWheel’s ad servers.&nbsp; In such case, your FreeWheel cookie will not be uniquely identified. &nbsp;The non-personally identifiable information that is automatically transmitted includes your browser type, Internet service provider, information about the general content of the site or page displayed on your browser, and other non-personally identifiable information provided by the Web Site or content provider.&nbsp; When you receive this cookie, FreeWheel’s systems will know that you have opted out and will not attempt to assign other FreeWheel cookies in the future.&nbsp; Since the FreeWheel opt-out cookie does not contain a unique user number, it does not allow your browser to be identified uniquely.</p>
<p>
	P<strong>LEASE NOTE that if you erase or otherwise alter your browser's cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers) or use a new or different computer, you may need to opt out again.</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>
	We maintain security measures in place with the view to protecting against the loss, misuse, and alteration of any information that is under our control. &nbsp;However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. &nbsp;While we are committed to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, please be advised that FreeWheel assumes no responsibility or liability for disclosure of your information (personal or otherwise) due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond FreeWheel’s control.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Changes in our business or privacy policies</strong></p>
<p>
	As we continue to develop our business, we may sell certain of our assets. &nbsp;In such transactions, visitor information may be one of the transferred assets. &nbsp;Also, in the event that all or substantially all of our assets are acquired in a transaction, our visitor information may be an asset that is reviewed and transferred. &nbsp;Such a transaction will be disclosed per the guidelines below. &nbsp;Also, we reserve the right to disclose any data we collect at our sites if required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority or to protect the health and safety of our employees or the general public.</p>
<p>
	If we decide to change our privacy policies, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. &nbsp;If, however, we are going to use visitors' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify visitors by posting a notice on our web site for thirty (30) days in advance of such use.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Children</strong></p>
<p>
	This Web site is not intended to nor does it seek to receive information from children under the age of 13.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Access or Update Your Information.</strong></p>
<p>
	We provide all visitors to our web site with the opportunity to review, modify, and delete any personally identifiable information that has previously been provided. &nbsp;You can send us an email or write to us as set forth below.</p>
