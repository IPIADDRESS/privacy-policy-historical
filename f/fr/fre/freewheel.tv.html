<p>We also have no control over the content of the advertisement, including any cookies and web beacons set by advertisers on our customers’ Sites. Each customer understands that in the course of providing Services to it, we collect or receive information from the web browsers of individuals that are either visiting such customer’s web property or viewing content that is owned or displayed by such customer. This information includes frequency of ads delivered and other delivery statistics, time, browser type and version, visitor’s operating system, device type, referral URL, visitors’ IP addresses, visitors’ countries inferred from their IP addresses, and cookie data, including user IDs. We require our customers to obtain consent for our use of such information and we use it for our provision of Services and enforcement of our rights as described in the applicable customer contract, to improve our Services, and to compile aggregated statistics for internal or marketing purposes.</p>
<p>We do not possess or have access to information that could match IP addresses or user IDs to the identity of individuals.

Further, we may use and retain such information only as provided in its agreement with our customer. We require each of our customers to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations that are applicable to their use of our Services, and we promise each customer that we will do the same with respect to our provision of Services. We ask each customer to post a privacy policy that covers our Services and to maintain all necessary rights to allow us to provide the Services, including without limitation to receive the information that we collect and store on such customer’s behalf.

<p>None of the principles in this Policy changed following FreeWheel’s acquisition by Comcast Cable Communications, LLC (“Comcast”). All of FreeWheel’s contractual obligations with respect to each customer’s information have remained intact. Also, post-acquisition, FreeWheel has continued to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Comcast, meaning the two companies are separate legal entities. As such, FreeWheel cannot per the terms of its agreement with each customer allow Comcast (or any of Comcast’s other affiliates) to access FreeWheel customer data for any purpose. Maintaining FreeWheel’s status as a trusted partner is critical to the continued success of our business. Comcast and FreeWheel have been careful to organise the corporate structure so as not to disrupt that trust.</p>
