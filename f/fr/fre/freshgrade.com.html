This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information that is collected through our website and our mobile application(s) (collectively, our “Service”), as well as your choices regarding the collection and use of information. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Use. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting information with FreshGrade.</p> <p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the <a href="https://www.freshgrade.com/terms-and-conditions/">FreshGrade Terms of Use</a> by reference. In addition to reviewing our Privacy Policy, you should also read the FreshGrade Terms of Use. Your use of the FreshGrade Service constitutes your agreement to the <a href="https://www.freshgrade.com/terms-and-conditions/">FreshGrade Terms of Use</a> and to this Privacy Policy.</p> <p>“You” or “your” means a User of the Service. An “<strong>Individual User</strong>” as used in these Terms may be a teacher or school administrator using the free FreshGrade Service. Where applicable, “you” or “your” also means a school or school district/board or other educational institution otherwise known as an “<strong>Enterprise User</strong>” using the subscription FreshGrade Service, with whom the User is associated either as a student, teacher, school or district/board administrator, or parent of a student and is authorized by the Enterprise User to use the Service (an “<strong>Authorized User</strong>”). The term “User(s)” as used herein will refer to all users of the Service: Individual Users, Authorized Users, and Enterprise Users. In this Privacy Policy, we use the term “<strong>School</strong>” to refer to teachers, principals, school districts/boards, school administrators and any other User acting on behalf of an educational institution, regardless of whether the User is an Individual User or an Enterprise User.</p> <h3>What is Personal Information?</h3> <p>Personal information is information that can identify a specific individual, such as a name, address, telephone number, email address, or other account number, and other information linked to that personal information. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the FreshGrade Service.</p> <p><span id="collect" style="margin-top: -150px; padding-bottom: 150px; display: block;"> </span></p> <h3>1. How We Collect Information</h3> <p>We collect personal information in a number of ways from our website visitors and users of our Service.</p> <p><span style="margin-top: -150px; padding-bottom: 150px; display: block;"> </span></p> <h4>A. Information about Schools</h4> <p>We ask for certain information when a teacher, principal, school district/board or school administrator (collectively, “School”) registers for a FreshGrade account or corresponds with us online, which may include, but is not limited to, first and last name, email address, profile picture, user name and password, and any additional personal information you voluntarily provide in your FreshGrade profile, which could include, but is not limited to, your school name and location, what grade level and subject matter you teach, your position within the school, and the type of devices your students use (collectively, “School Data”). We may also collect School Data if the School sends us a message or responds to emails and surveys. Once the School has an account, we collect content and information provided by the School through the School’s use of the Service, which could include class rosters, parent contact information, assignments and classroom content, photos, images, video and any other content the teacher or Authorized Users posts to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain and provide the features and functionality of the Service, to analyze and improve our Service offerings and functionality, and to communicate with our Schools and users.</p> <p><span style="margin-top: -150px; padding-bottom: 150px; display: block;"> </span></p> <h4>B. Information about Parents and Guardians</h4> <p>We ask for certain Information when a parent or guardian (referred to herein as a “parent”) registers for a FreshGrade account, which may include information such as first and last name, email address, profile picture, user name and password, and any additional information the parent voluntarily provides, which could include, but is not limited to the name and location of your child’s school and what your relationship is with the child (parent, grandparent, guardian etc.). We may collect other personal information you provide to the Service, such as your email address and your child’s teacher’s name and email address if you request that we invite the teacher to check out our Service. We use this information to operate, maintain and provide the features and functionality of the Service, to analyze and improve our Service offerings and functionality, and to communicate with you.</p> <p><span style="margin-top: -150px; padding-bottom: 150px; display: block;"> </span></p> <h4>C. Information about Students</h4> <p>FreshGrade provides the Service to Schools to facilitate School and parent engagement and create personalized learning portfolios. Through the provision of this Service to a School or parent, we may collect or have access to personal information about students (“Student Data”) that is provided by the School, parent or by the student. The type of information we collect will depend on how the School, parent or student uses the Service, but could include the student’s first and last name, email address, profile photo, class assignment data, and other classroom content. Some Schools set up the Service to permit a student to log into a student account. Only students who have been invited and authorized to use the Service by a School may register as a “student” for a FreshGrade account and use the Service.</p> <p>We consider Student Data to be highly confidential and use this data solely to provide our Services to the School and to the parent, and in limited ways, for our internal purposes in accordance with our Terms of Service or specific agreements with Schools. Our collection, use, and disclosure of Student Data is governed by our Terms of Service and/or any other agreement with the School, in the U.S. by the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and applicable state laws, and by other applicable Canadian, U.S. and international laws relating to the collection and use of personal information of students. If you have any questions about our collection and use of Student Data, please contact us at care@freshgrade.com. If you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting the personal information of a student, please contact your educational institution directly.</p> <p>See <a href="#information">“How FreshGrade Shares Information with Others”</a> below for more information on the limited ways in which we share School Data and Student Data. See <a href="#child-privacy">“Children’s Privacy”</a> below for more information about how we collect and use the personal information of children under 13.</p> <h4>d. Information We collect from third party services and social media sites</h4> <p class="O-BodyText"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">We may collect information about you from third party services that you connect to our Service. For example, if you use a single-sign on like Google Apps for Education to access your FreshGrade account, we may receive certain information from that third party application. We may also receive information about you if you interact with us through various social media, for example, by following us on Twitter or liking us on Facebook. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Service.</span></span></p> <h4>E. Information Collected Through Technology</h4> <p>Like most websites and online services, we automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our website or use our Service.

Depending on your mobile device, you may not be able to reject cookies. If you decide not to accept our cookies, you will still be able to access those parts of the FreshGrade Service available to the general public but you may not be able to use some of the network’s features or services, and you may have a less satisfactory experience.</p> <p><span style="margin-top: -150px; padding-bottom: 150px; display: block;"> </span></p> <h4>Third Party Tracking and Online Advertising:</h4> <p>We may permit third party online advertising networks to collect information from visitors to <a href="http://www.freshgrade.com">www.freshgrade.com</a> to provide customized content, advertising and commercial messaging to you from time to time on other websites or services. Typically, the information is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies.

How FreshGrade Uses and Shares Information About You</h3> <p>We share data within the Service as needed to perform the Service. For example, Student Data will be shared between and among the School Users and parent(s) as well as with others who have been authorized to access the content for an educational purpose. Sharing within the Service will depend on the settings and functionality selected by the School. FreshGrade only shares personal information with third parties in limited circumstances, described below. We will never share or sell Student Data with third parties for marketing purposes.</p> <p>FreshGrade uses and shares your personal information in the following ways:</p> <ul> <li>With consent. We share information with consent and at the direction of Schools and parents. A User may direct FreshGrade to share specific information with another individual, for example, if a teacher directs FreshGrade to send a communication to a parent, or an Enterprise User may be able to control data sharing functionality for all User accounts within that school district/board or school system. Parents should contact their child’s School with any questions about School-authorized data sharing functionality.</li> <li>With our trusted vendors and third party service providers. We may share personal information with certain trusted vendors, third party service providers and individuals to perform tasks on our behalf, but strictly for the purpose of carrying out their work for us, which may include business development, software design, hosting, customer support, accounting, and other similar services. Personal information will be shared with these third parties as reasonably needed to perform their services to us, and under reasonable confidentiality terms.</li> <li>We may share information with other companies owned by or under common ownership with FreshGrade. These companies will use your personal information in the same way as we can under this Privacy Policy.</li> <li>Aggregate Data. We will share information in an aggregated and/or anonymous form that does not reasonably identify you directly as an individual. For example, we may share aggregate data with other students, parents or Schools to display statistical data related to students in a particular classroom, school, district/board, or geographic location. We may also use aggregate or anonymized data to study and improve our Service, user functionality, and product offerings.</li> <li>We may disclose your personal information as required or authorized by law or subpoena or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (i) comply with the law or a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us; (ii) to comply with or the lawful request of law enforcement; (iii) to enforce or apply our Terms of Service or other agreements or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (iv) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or safety of FreshGrade, our employees, our Users, or others.</li> <li>If FreshGrade or some or all of its assets were acquired or otherwise transferred to a third party in the course of a company transaction, such as a merger, sale of company assets or shares, reorganization, financing, change of control, bankruptcy or other corporate event, the personal information of our users may be transferred to or acquired by a third party, but only if such third party agrees to be subject to the same commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy with respect to user personal information. If the transaction involves the transfer of Student Data to a third party, we will provide you with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of Student Data by terminating your account before the transfer occurs.</li> </ul> <p><span style="margin-top: -150px; padding-bottom: 150px; display: block;"> </span></p> <h4>How FreshGrade Uses and Shares Student Data.</h4> <p>In addition to the actions described above, FreshGrade may facilitate the sharing of Student Data with third parties through the Service, though only when instructed and authorized to do so on behalf of the School or parent. We will use personal information about Students to provide the FreshGrade Service and permit data sharing among Users authorized to view and access the Student Data. The teacher will be able to collect, review, and edit information about all of the students in the classroom. A school principal, school or district/board administrator, or other individual authorized by the School to view and access student accounts, may be able to view and access all activity and content associated with the student accounts associated with the school or district/board. Each student and his or her parent will only have access to view or submit information relative to that particular student. Neither students (nor their parents) will be able to view or otherwise access the personal information of other students, unless it is provided to that student account by the School (for example, a class photo and class roster containing the names and photos of other students may be added by a teacher to a student account). Except for the circumstances noted above, FreshGrade shares student data only for purposes of providing the educational service to and at the direction of Schools and parents. If you have any questions about how FreshGrade uses or shares Student Data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:care@freshgrade.com">care@freshgrade.com</a> or discuss this with your child’s School.</p> <p><span id="communications" style="margin-top: -150px; padding-bottom: 150px; display: block;"> </span></p> <h3>3.

If you are a School, you may access, update and correct the personal information contained in any account under your control by logging into your account, and/or by logging into your School Student Information Management System (“SIS”). Parents may request to access, correct and update a student’s personal information, but these request may require the School’s authorization to update or delete information contained in active School accounts.</p> <p>We retain your personal information, including FreshGrade content, for as long as the account is covered by an active subscription or license as described in our Terms of Service, or until we receive a request to delete such information.</p> <p>When a FreshGrade portfolio is no longer in active use by a School, the portfolio will be archived in “read-only” format. Archived portfolios are maintained to provide parents indefinite access to the student’s work, and parents and students can access such data at any time. FreshGrade maintains this information only for the benefit of the parent and student. FreshGrade may continue to send email communications to the parent and student until we receive an unsubscribe request or until the account has been deleted. If the account is no longer covered by a School license, FreshGrade will delete archived accounts, including the personal information and Content associated with such accounts, after a period of dormancy.</p> <p>To delete an archived account, please contact us at <a href="mailto:care@freshgrade.com">care@freshgrade.com</a>. FreshGrade will promptly delete or de-identify account data within thirty (30) days of such request or instruction, though we may retain and use certain information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, and all information stored in our backup data repository will be deleted pursuant to our standard deletion policy. We may maintain aggregate or de-identified data in a form that does not reasonably identify a particular individual, for our internal use or analytic purposes.</p> <p><span id="child-privacy" style="margin-top: -150px; padding-bottom: 150px; display: block;"> </span></p> <h3>7.

Please contact us at care@freshgrade.com if you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13 without proper consents so that we may delete such information as soon as possible.</p> <p><span id="service" style="margin-top: -150px; padding-bottom: 150px; display: block;"> </span></p> <h3>8.
