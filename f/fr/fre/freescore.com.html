<p align="left"><strong>What information is collected?</strong></p>
<p>Generally, we gather two types of information. The first type of information is the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that you expressly provide when you enroll in FreeScore. This information includes your name, mailing address, e-mail address or some other unique personal identifier that we can use to confirm sales and billing information (e.g. city of birth or mother's maiden name). Occasionally, we may request other information from you that may be used by our Membership Services department to confirm enrollment, update your account or confirm your order. From time to time, we may offer you optional surveys that may ask you for your opinions or demographic data so that we can improve our program and offerings. We receive permission to post testimonials that include personally identifiable information on FreeScore prior to posting. If you would like to remove any testimonial, please contact us at membersupport@freescore.com.</p>
<p>If you use our blog on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of the blog, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in this forum.</p>
<p>The second type of information is technical and statistical information that is collected automatically whenever you visit our Web site through the use of tracking technologies such as Cookies and Pixel Tags (see below). This type of information collected may include things such as your IP address, operating system, type of browser and Web site activity. We collect this data to help us improve the quality of our Web site and make your visits to the site easy, convenient and meaningful.</p>
<p>We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>Who is collecting the information?</strong></p>
<p>FreeScore is marketed and distributed by FYI Direct, a leading marketing solutions company. The information collected on the site is owned by FYI Direct and/or its marketing partners depending on who offered you membership in the program.</p>
<p><strong>How do you use the information collected?</strong></p>
<p>We use the Personal Information you provide to service your membership. For example, we request your mailing address so we know where to send the merchandise certificates, gift cards and other benefits that you may purchase, and any other information you may request. We also may send you additional membership information such as updates about our program and special offers. We use your credit card information to bill you for the membership fee and any benefits you may purchase. We use your e-mail address to notify you of program updates, special offers and promotions.

<p><strong>Do you share Personal Information with third parties?</strong></p>
<p>FreeScore may share Personal Information with third parties whom we employ to perform functions on our behalf. For example, FreeScore uses a third party to verify and process your credit card information in order to charge you for requested benefits or services. All third parties are contractually obligated to use your Personal Information only for the purpose for which it is given. We are not responsible for the information practices of third parties. The collection, use and disclosure of information by third parties are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from our policy.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may also share Personal Information with our affiliates and/or marketing partners who offer products and services that we think will be of interest to you. If you prefer not to have your Personal Information shared with our affiliates and/or marketing partners, please indicate what offers you are not interested in receiving on the E- mail Preferences page, if available, or by sending us an e-mail using the <a href="/ModSiteAdminTools/LookUp/LegalDocuments/%7BLegalDocuments.Link.ContactUsPage%7D">Contact Us</a> page.
