<!--BEGIN CONTENT-->

Wondermill Webworks Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm
commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and 
dissemination practices for all Webmasters.org sites run by note.com LLC, including 
this website: Freedback.com.

</font></p><p><font size="2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Policies for Webmasters (Website Owners) Using our services:</font></b><br>Our sites' registration forms requires Webmasters&nbsp; to give us contact information
(like their name and email address) and demographic information (like their zipcode, 
country or language). We use contact information from the registration form to send 
the Webmaster "Service Mailings", from us only, which include legal notices, new 
features and valuable tips, as well as promotions about our company and our partners. 
The Webmaster's contact information is also used to contact them when necessary. 
Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor 
the Webmaster's experience, and that of Web Visitors coming to our site through the 
Webmasters' site, showing the Webmaster and the Web Visitors content that we think they 
might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This 
information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.

</font></p><p><font size="2">Webmasters who sign up for our Affiliate Program provide additional data about their legal 
entities to effectuate payment of revenue earned through the program.

</font></p><p><font size="2">As noted above, our Service Mailings include periodic notices to our member Webmasters 
regarding new features, legal notices, and valuable tips. Because the Service Mailings are 
the only method of sending legal notices to member Webmasters, a Webmaster cannot  unsubscribe 
from Service Mailings without terminating his/her use of our service.

</font></p><p><font size="2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Policies for Web Visitors (Surfers) Using our Service</font></b><br>most Web Visitors come to our site after they have filled out submission forms on the sites 
operated by member Webmasters participating in our service. We pass all data that a Web Visitor 
enters to the Webmaster of the site on which the submission form is located. At the same time, 
we bring the Web Visitor to our website where we can present them with advertising on our response 
page. If the advertising on our site contains a submission form we may autopopulate this form with 
data extracted from the previous form submission on the member Webmaster's site. We do not disclose data to advertisers without your permission - your name, email address and information is sent ONLY to the webmaster who's form you filled out.


</font></p><p><font size="2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Policies for both Webmasters and Web Visitors</font></b><br><u>Links to other sites</u>: The advertisements on our site may contain links to other sites. 
<b>Freedback.com</b> is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 
Before submitting data to an advertiser site, it is the Web Visitor's responsibility to ascertain 
the advertiser's Privacy Policy and not submit the data if (s)he does not find it acceptable.

</font></p><p><font size="2"><u>Cookies<b>:</b></u> Our site uses cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. 
We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't 
have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. We also use cookies to track users for the purposes 
of paying member sites registered with our Affiliate Program. Cookies are set from both this website 
as well as from the master domain, <b>Webmasters.org</b>.

</font></p><p><font size="2">We use an outside ad company to display some of the ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. 
While we use cookies in other parts of our Website, cookies received with the ads displayed through the 
outside ad company ads are collected by that ad company, and we do not have access to this information.

</font></p><p><font size="2"><u>Contests</u>: We may run contests on our site in which we ask contest entrants for contact information 
(like their email address) and demographic information (like their zipcode, country or language). We use 
contact data from our contests to send entrants information and promotions, through mailings conducted by us 
only, about our company and our partners. The entrant's contact information is also used to contact the entrant 
when necessary. We may also use this data to tailor the entrant's experience at our sites, showing them content 
that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This 
information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. Contest entrants may opt-out of receiving future 
mailings related to that contest; see the choice/opt-out section below.

</font></p><p><font size="2">We also have contractual arrangements with affiliate marketing networks, provide some of the advertisements
shown on our sites.  To find out more about how these networks handle the collection of personal
information, please visit their provacy statements at:

</font></p><p><font size="2"><u>IP Addresses:</u> We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our 
Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.

</font></p><p><font size="2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Security</font></b><br>We take the security of our data seriously and utilize several software and hardware devices to protect 
unauthorized access to our data. In addition, we monitor the use of our service to detect attempts at accessing 
our data. Any such attempts may be dealt with on a technical or legal level, as appropriate in a given case.

</font></p><p><font size="2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Supplementation of Information</font></b><br>This site supplements the information that you provide with information that is received from third parties. 
For example, we may contract with a firm which identifies geographic locale of an IP address in order to better 
present the site (including our advertiser messages) in the appropriate language local to a Webmaster or Web 
Visitor.

<br>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web 
site, you can contact
