	<div class="content">

		<p><a href="http://www.wondermill.com/">Wondermill Webworks Inc.</a> (Freedback's parent company) has created this privacy statement in order to disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Freedback form procesing service.</p>

		<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Policies for Webmasters (Clients) Using
		our services:</font></b><br>Our sites' registration forms requires
		Webmasters&nbsp; to give us contact information (like their name and email
		address) and demographic information (like their zipcode, country or language).
		We use contact information from the registration form to send the Webmaster
		"Service Mailings", from us only, which include legal notices, new features and
		valuable tips, as well as promotions about our company and our partners. The
		Webmaster's contact information is also used to contact them when necessary.
		Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to
		tailor the Webmaster's experience, and that of Web Visitors coming to our site
		through the Webmasters' site, showing the Webmaster and the Web Visitors content
		that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according
		to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers on an
		aggregate basis.


		</p><p>As noted above, our Service Mailings include periodic notices to our member
		Webmasters regarding new features and legal notices. Because the
		Service Mailings are the only method of sending legal notices to member
		Webmasters, a Webmaster cannot  unsubscribe from Service Mailings without
		terminating his/her use of our service.

		</p><p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Policies for Web Visitors (Surfers) Using our
		Service</font></b><br>most Web Visitors come to our site after they have filled
		out submission forms on the sites operated by member Webmasters participating in
		our service. We pass all data that a Web Visitor enters to the Webmaster of the
		site on which the submission form is located. At the same time, we bring the Web
		Visitor to our website where we can present them with advertising on our
		response page. If the advertising on our site contains a submission form we may
		autopopulate this form with data extracted from the previous form submission on
		the member Webmaster's site. We do not disclose data to advertisers without your
		permission - your name, email address and information is sent ONLY to the
		webmaster who's form you filled out.


		</p><p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Policies for both Webmasters and Web
		Visitors</font></b><br><u>Links to other sites</u>: The advertisements on our
		site may contain links to other sites. <b>Freedback.com</b> is not responsible
		for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. Before submitting
		data to an advertiser site, it is the Web Visitor's responsibility to ascertain
		the advertiser's Privacy Policy and not submit the data if (s)he does not find
		it acceptable.

		</p><p><u>Cookies<b>:</b></u> Our site uses cookies to make sure you don't see the
		same ad repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests
		and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit
		our site. We also use cookies to track users for the purposes of paying member
		sites registered with our Affiliate Program. Cookies are set from both this
		website as well as from the master domain, <b>Webmasters.org</b>.

		</p><p>We use an outside ad company to display some of the ads on our site. These
		ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Website,
		cookies received with the ads displayed through the outside ad company ads are
		collected by that ad company, and we do not have access to this information.



		</p><p><u>Contests</u>: We may run contests on our site in which we ask contest
		entrants for contact information (like their email address) and demographic
		information (like their zipcode, country or language). We use contact data from
		our contests to send entrants information and promotions, through mailings
		conducted by us only, about our company and our partners. The entrant's contact
		information is also used to contact the entrant when necessary. We may also use
		this data to tailor the entrant's experience at our sites, showing them content
		that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according
		to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers on an
		aggregate basis. Contest entrants may opt-out of receiving future mailings
		related to that contest; see the choice/opt-out section below.

		</p><p>We also have contractual arrangements with affiliate marketing networks,
		provide some of the advertisements shown on our sites.  To find out more about
		how these networks handle the collection of personal information, please visit
		their provacy statements at:

		</p><p><u>IP Addresses:</u> We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with
		our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help
		identify you and to gather broad demographic information.

		</p><p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Security</font></b><br>We take the security of
		our data seriously and utilize several software and hardware devices to protect
		unauthorized access to our data. In addition, we monitor the use of our service
		to detect attempts at accessing our data. Any such attempts may be dealt with on
		a technical or legal level, as appropriate in a given case.

		</p><p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Supplementation of
		Information</font></b><br>This site supplements the information that you provide
		with information that is received from third parties. For example, we may
		contract with a firm which identifies geographic locale of an IP address in
		order to better present the site (including our advertiser messages) in the
		appropriate language local to a Webmaster or Web Visitor.

		this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact
