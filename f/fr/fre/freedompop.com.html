					<h3><a name="cookies"></a>USE OF COOKIES, JAVASCRIPT, WEB BEACONS, AND OTHER TRACKING DEVICES</h3>
					<ol type="a">
						<li><em>Cookies</em>. We and third parties use cookies on our Site and at our Services. "<strong>Cookies</strong>" are a feature in your browser software. We use cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this Site or our emails. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this Site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies, for example, to keep track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; and to save your password for ease of access to our Site. You can disable certain types of cookies, but portions of the Site (such as account creation, ordering, and account management) may not work properly if you disable cookies. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent cookies. We also allow third parties to place cookies on our Site.</li>
						<ul>
							<li><u>Session Cookies</u>. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.</li>
							<li><u>Persistent Cookies</u>. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, which may be combined with other user information. We also use persistent cookies to enable us to recognize whether you have responded to a questionnaire or completed a registration.</li>
							<li><u>Third Party Cookies</u>. We also engage third parties to track and analyze non-personal and personal information and to serve advertisements. To do so, we may permit third parties to apply cookies to users of our Site, where permitted by law, and, subject to your right to opt-out through the Network Advertising Initiative (as discussed below). We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Site and to analyze site usage. Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with other information that they have collected.</li>
						</ul>
						<li><em>JavaScript</em>. We may also use JavaScript within certain advertisements. JavaScript is a computer language that enhances the functionality of websites, particularly in respect to pictures. We do not collect any personal information via JavaScript but use it to analyze and improve the Site's functions. You may deactivate JavaScript via your browser settings or activate it the same way. If you disable JavaScript you will not be able to use some of the functions of our Site.</li>
						<li><em>Web Beacons</em>. We also use electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs, clear gifs or action tags) that allow us to collect certain information about your visit to these web pages (including the number of users who have visited those pages), measure and improve the effectiveness of advertisements, and deliver services. Web beacons collect information such as a cookie number, time and date of page view and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. This information may be shared with one or more third parties so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to our Site and our Services, how those visitors use our Site, and the effectiveness of their advertisements. We may also use web beacons in email messages that we send to you, for example, to track whether recipients read our emails. Because web beacons are the same as any other content request, you cannot opt out or refuse them. web beacons can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or changing the cookie setup in your browser.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>ADVERTISEMENTS</h3>
					<p>We display advertisements on our Site. We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve these advertisements. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Sites and other websites you have visited. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third- party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our Services, both personal and non-personal information. We do not control these advertisers or advertising networks or any other third parties whose websites may be linked from our Services or their practices. We also do not control the data use practices of those persons or entities that may access your information on this Site for the purposes of providing the service or product you have requested or third party Ad Networks. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and opt-out choices of those third parties so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information. Some of the advertisements are based on the collection of personal information and others are based on the collection of aggregate information. <strong>You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks. The website&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank"><strong>http:// www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to "opt-out" of third-party ad networks operated by NAI members.</strong>&nbsp;You also may contact the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http:/ /www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> for information about opting out of targeted advertising and your choices regarding having information used by DAA, including how to "opt-out" of third-party ad networks operated by About Ads members. Opting out of one or more NAI members or DAA members (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI's and DAA's websites accessible by the above links.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>YOUR PREFERENCES/OPTING-OUT</h3>
					<p>If you do not want to receive marketing or advertising from us via email, you may opt-out by following the instructions contained in the email. You also may exercise your email preferences by logging into your account and following the link to email preferences. It may take up to 10 days to process your request. Please note that we will continue to send you customer service related emails even if you have opted out of receiving marketing communications from us. If you subscribe to services from different affiliates, you may need to unsubscribe from each affiliate's marketing list. Under your email preferences, you also may opt-out of certain third party marketing. If, however, we already have shared your name with a particular third party, then you will need to contact that third party to opt-out of future communications.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>UPDATES TO THIS POLICY</h3>
					<p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy from time to time. If we make any changes that materially affect the use of your personal information, we will endeavor to notify you by changing the "<strong>Last Revision</strong>" date and posting the updated Policy on this Site.</p>
