<h1 class="title">Privacy Policy</h1>


<p><font size="-1">FreeWebAds.Biz strives to offer its visitors the many 
        advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalised 
        experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, 
        e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms 
        of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email 
        address to any unauthorised third party. Period."</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1"><strong>How we gather information from users</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">How we collect and store information depends on the page 
        you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and 
        the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information 
        when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request 
        certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You 
        may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, 
        message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. 
        Like most Web sites, FreeWebAds.Biz also collects information automatically 
        and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our 
        visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider 
        or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your 
        visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, 
        sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, 
        or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement 
        while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also 
        gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose 
        not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser 
        to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access 
        certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name 
        and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features 
        according to your preferences.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1"><strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">Like other Web publishers, we collect information to 
        enhance your visit and deliver more individualised content and advertising. 
        We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">Aggregated Information (information that does not personally 
        identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information 
        about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other 
        users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages 
        are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information 
        may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. 
        Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information 
        about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.

        on FreeWebAds.Biz to communicate with you about your registration and

        you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation 
        of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. 
        We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from 
        time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, 
        merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, 
        user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose 
        your information in response to a court order, at other times when we

        the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement

        page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. 
        Also, through FreeWebAds.Biz you may be introduced to, or be able to

      <p><font size="-1">While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners 
        or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt 
        to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. 
        For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may 
        include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have 
        seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available on our 
        site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies
