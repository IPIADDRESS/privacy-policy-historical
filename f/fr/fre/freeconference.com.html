                <p>FreeConference.com recognizes that parents often sign up for

                <p>When our customer is a business or other entity purchasing 
                  service for employees or other authorized users, this Policy 
                  will generally govern the personal information associated with 
                  individual employees or authorized users.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, whether the 
                  business customer has access to personal information of employees 
                  or other authorized users will be governed by the terms of any

                <p>Our definition of personal information does not include "aggregate"

                  a group or category of services or customers from which individual 
                  customer identities have been removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, how you 
                  use a service may be collected and combined with information 
                  about how others use the same service, but no personal information 
                  will be included in the resulting data.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aggregate data helps 
                  us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better 
                  consider new services or tailor existing services to customer 
                  desires.&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of aggregate data is our ability to prepare 
                  a report that indicates that a certain number of our customers
