						<p>FreeSamples.org is committed to respecting the privacy rights of users of the Website (all capitalized terms not defined in this notice have the same meanings as in FreeSamples.org’ Website Terms of Use, which is incorporated herein by reference). FreeSamples.org created this Privacy Policy to give You confidence as You visit and use the Website, and to demonstrate its commitment to fair information practices and to the protection of privacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Website and not to any Third-Party Websites, which may have data collection, storage and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. For additional information, see the section concerning Third-Party Websites, below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BY USING THE WEBSITE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO THE TERMS OF, THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY LEAVE THE WEBSITE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each time You use the Website, the then-current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, each time You use the Website You should check the date of this Privacy Policy (which appears at the end) and review any changes since the last time You used the Website. For additional information, see the section concerning Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy, below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(a)Traffic Data.</strong> Like most website operators, FreeSamples.org automatically gathers information of the sort that browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers accessing the Website; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Website (collectively “Traffic Data”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify You.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(b)Cookies.</strong> A “Cookie” is a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website. The purpose of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the Website. FreeSamples.org uses Cookies to customize Your experience on the Website to Your interests, to ensure that You do not see the same advertisements or informational messages repeatedly, and to store Your password so You do not have to re-enter it each time You visit the Website. For additional information on FreeSamples.org’s uses of Cookies, see the section concerning Information Use and Disclosure Practices/Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies, below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSERS TO REFUSE COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN OF THE SERVICES AND CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(c) Personal Information.</strong> In order for You to use certain of the Services, You may be asked to provide FreeSamples.org certain information that personally identifies You (“Personal Information”). Personal Information includes, without limitation: (1) “Contact Data” (such as Your name and e-mail address) and (2) “Demographic Data” (such as age and time zone). In each case, You will be asked to provide Personal Information; the Website will not gather it surreptitiously. FreeSamples.org may supplement the Personal Information You provide with additional Personal Information gathered from public sources or from third-parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies) who may lawfully provide such information to FreeSamples.org.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are under no obligation to provide Personal Information, with the caveat that Your refusal to do so may prevent You from using certain of the Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(d) Information You Make Public.</strong> The Website contains features (e.g. forums) that permit You to upload, post, transmit, display, perform or distribute content, information or other, including Your Personal Information. Any information that You choose to disclose by means of such features becomes public information over which FreeSamples.org is unable to exercise control. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose Your Personal Information by means of such features, and You agree to assume all responsibility for doing so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

From time to time, FreeSamples.org may release Traffic Data and information gathered using Cookies in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website. FreeSamples.org does not attempt to link information gathered using Cookies to Personal Information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(b)Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
