Privacy Policy</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">This
privacy policy describes the privacy and data handling practices of
FreeSlide.com, a website of FreeSlide, Inc. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Please
note, to become a FreeSlide.com member and participate in its membership
incentive promotion, you must be at least 18 years old and a legal resident of
the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
with a valid email and mailing address. If you do not meet these requirements,
we ask that you do not complete the registration process.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><b>What
Information We Collect/How We Use It </b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">We
store and use the information you give us in accordance with the terms of this
Policy. Our registration form requests that you provide certain contact and
profile information (like your name, e-mail address, postal address, and phone
number). Some of the requested information is required in order to receive
FreeSlide Services; other information is optional. The required information is
indicated as such on the registration pages of the FreeSlide Web Site.
Depending on the specific FreeSlide Services for which a user registers,
certain category specific information will be requested. We use this additional
data to personalize your FreeSlide experience. By obtaining and using this
information, we can provide you with the most timely, relevant and
individualized service according to your preferences and interests.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Other
than the information we require in order to provide one or more FreeSlide
Services to you, you do not have to provide any further information. But your
election to withhold certain information will limit the value of the FreeSlide
experience for you.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">In
addition, we might receive information about you from outside sources and add
it to your FreeSlide membership information. We do this to improve
personalization of our services (for example, providing better newsletter
content, advertising or special offers that we think will interest you).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">We
also collect information such as the identification of the server your computer
is logged onto and whether you opened a FreeSlide e-mail delivered to you. We
also may compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in
an effort to avoid sending identical messages to our members. You can add and
modify any of the information you have provided by following the instructions
set forth below.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">We
use all of this information in the following ways:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;
to provide you with personalized information via electronic delivery and/or
direct mail; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;
to send you targeted advertising via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;
to contact you for feedback and surveys via electronic delivery and/or direct
mail; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;
to send you general and administrative information about your FreeSlide
membership via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; and </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;
to provide your contact information to FreeSlide marketing partners to allow
them to send you special offers via electronic delivery and direct
mail.&nbsp;&nbsp; This most often occurs when you request that we do so such as
when completing an online survey.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Agents:
We employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our
behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate
information from customer lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing
analysis. These agents have access to member personal information as needed to
perform their functions for FreeSlide, but we do not permit them to use it for
other purposes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Right
to Sell/License Data:&nbsp; Freeslide may sell and/or license the personal
information that you provide to us to third party businesses. These businesses
may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including
lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation,&nbsp;email
marketing, and telemarketing.</p>

allow us to monitor whether you access specific content or advertisements
contained in that e-mail. When you click on one of these links, we will record
that click and certain activities on the Web page associated with that link. We
may use this information for various purposes, such as to conduct internal
research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior in and to our
e-mail advertisements and content, and to better understand and serve you.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Disclosures.

that you provide to FreeSlide, to one or more third party entities pursuant to
a sale, merger, assignment, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of a
portion, or all of, the assets or stock of FreeSlide or its affiliated
entities, or as otherwise provided herein. FreeSlide may also disclose
information to allow third party business partners and affiliates deliver
marketing offers to you, however we only make these types of disclosures if you
request that we do so.</p>
