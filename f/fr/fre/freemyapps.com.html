<p><strong>Fiksu Application Marketing Service</strong><br>
  Fiksu buys mobile advertising space on behalf of our Clients which are generally mobile application providers and companies looking to advertise via mobile applications.

We also use your Mobile ID and the information associated with your device Mobile ID over time (e.g., the applications you download, when and how you use those applications, and any publisher-provided demographic data) to enhance our services and to select Fiksu Client ads that are most likely to be of interest to you.</p>
<p>Fiksu may use agents and contractors in order to provide our services to Clients. If such agents and contractors have access to your Mobile ID and/or the information associated with your Mobile ID, they are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Fiksu.</p>
