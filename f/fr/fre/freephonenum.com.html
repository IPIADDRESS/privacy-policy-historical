functionality of the Website, to much better comprehend our users, and to improve our services. You will see
terms in our Privacy Policy that are capitalized. These terms have meanings as described in the Definitions
section below.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions</strong><br>"Non Personal Information" is information that is not personally
identifiable to you and that we automatically collect when you access our Website with a web browser. It may
also include publicly available information that is shared between you and others.</p>
<p>"Personally Identifiable Information" is non-public information that is personally identifiable to you and
obtained in order for us to provide you within our Website. Personally Identifiable Information may include
information such as your name, email address, and other related information that you provide to us or that
we obtain about you.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect</strong><br>Generally, you control the amount and type of information you
provide to us when using our Website.</p>
<p>As a Visitor, you can browse our website to find out more about our Website. You are not required to provide
us with any Personally Identifiable Information as a Visitor.</p>
<p><strong>Computer Information Collected</strong><br>When you use our Website, we automatically collect
certain computer information by the interaction of your mobile phone or web browser with our Website. Such
information is typically considered Non Personal Information. We also collect the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
Our Website uses "Cookies" to identify the areas of our Website that you have visited. A Cookie is a
small piece of data stored on your computer or mobile device by your web browser. We use Cookies to
personalize the Content that you see on our Website. Most web browsers can be set to disable the use
of Cookies. However, if you disable Cookies, you may not be able to access functionality on our
Website correctly or at all. We never place Personally Identifiable Information in Cookies.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Geographical Information</strong><br>
When you use the mobile application, we may use GPS technology (or other similar technology) to
determine your current location in order to determine the city you are located in and display
information with relevant data or advertisements. We will not share your current location with other
users or partners. If you do not want us to use your location for the purposes set forth above, you
should turn off the location services for the mobile application located in your account settings or in
your mobile phone settings and/or within the mobile application.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Information</strong><br>We automatically receive information from your web browser or
mobile device. This information includes the name of the website from which you entered our Website, if
any, as well as the name of the website to which you're headed when you leave our website. This

<br>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the Child's Online Privacy Security Act, no Website operator can require, as a condition to involvement
in an activity, that a child younger than 13 years of age divulge more details than is reasonably required.
FreePhoneNum.com abides by this demand. FreePhoneNum.com just collects information willingly offered; no
information is gathered passively. children under 13 can submit only their email address when sending us an
email in our "Contact Us" area. FreePhoneNum.com makes use of the email address to respond to a
one-time demand from a child under 13 and afterwards deletes the email address. In case FreePhoneNum.com
collects and maintains personal information relating to a child under 13, the parent may send out an email
to us to review, alter and/or erase such info as well as to decline to enable any additional collection or
use of the child's information.</p>
