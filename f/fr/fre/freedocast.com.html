An agent or affiliate of Freedocast may, at times and on being so  authorized, collect information on behalf of Freedocast. Third party providers  featured on or linked to by the Freedocast sites, such as vendors of products  and services offered through the sites, may be gathering the same kinds of  information.<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <strong>Cookies:</strong></p>
                      <p>&nbsp;To enable Freedocast to  make its sites more responsive to the needs of the Users, Freedocast may use a  standard feature of browser software called a "cookie," to assign  each visitor a unique, random number, a type of user ID that may reside on the  User’s computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the User but identifies  only the computer that is used to access the site. Advertisers and other third  parties that provide products or services through the Freedocast site may also  assign their own cookies to the User’s browser and such process is beyond  Freedocast’s control. Freedocast may use both session cookies (which are  temporary and disappear after the User closes the browser) and persistent  cookies (which remain after the User closes the browser and which may be used  by the User’s browser on subsequent visits to the site). The User may reset the  web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, some features of the Freedocast sites may not function properly if the  ability to accept cookies is disabled. <br>
                          <br>
                          <strong>Other Methods.</strong> </p>
                      <p>The Freedocast web pages may contain electronic.../images (called  "single-pixel GIFs" or "web beacons") that allow Freedocast  and its affiliates to count users who have visited particular pages or to  access certain cookies. These tools and other technologies to may be used to  recognize which pages users visit, and which links they click on. These  features may also be included in email newsletters so that Freedocast may learn  which messages have been opened and acted upon. These tools may also enable  Freedocast to verify online purchases by the User from the Freedocast sites or  from third party sites that have agreed to share such information with  Freedocast. Browser Level Information and IP Addresses. The Freedocast web  servers automatically collect limited information about the User’s computer  configuration, including browser software, the operating system, the website  that referred the User, and the User’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address browser  language, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages  viewed, the order of those pages, and the amount of time spent on particular  pages, the date and time of the User’s request, and one or more cookies that  may uniquely identify the User’s browser. <br>
                          <br>
                          <strong>Third Party.</strong> </p>
                      <p>Freedocast may permit third-party ad servers or ad networks, to  display advertisements within the Freedocast sites. Such third-party ad servers  or ad networks use technology to send, directly to the User’s your browser, the  advertisements and links that appear on the Freedocast sites and automatically  receive the User’s IP address when this happens. The third party may also use  other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the  effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising  content the User sees. The User should consult the respective privacy policies  of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their  practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices.  Freedocast’s privacy policy does not apply to, and Freedocast cannot control  the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.<br>

  <br>
                        The User may choose to use the Services to purchase goods/services from third party  providers.
