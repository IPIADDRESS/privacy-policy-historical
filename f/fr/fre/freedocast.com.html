                            &nbsp;To enable Freedocast to make its sites more responsive to the needs of the
                            Users, Freedocast may use a standard feature of browser software called a "cookie,"
                            to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a type of user ID that may reside
                            on the User’s computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the User but
                            identifies only the computer that is used to access the site. Advertisers and other
                            third parties that provide products or services through the Freedocast site may
                            also assign their own cookies to the User’s browser and such process is beyond
                            Freedocast’s control. Freedocast may use both session cookies (which are temporary
                            and disappear after the User closes the browser) and persistent cookies (which remain
                            after the User closes the browser and which may be used by the User’s browser
                            on subsequent visits to the site). The User may reset the web browser to refuse
                            all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of
                            the Freedocast sites may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies
                            is disabled.

                            tools and other technologies to may be used to recognize which pages users visit,
                            and which links they click on. These features may also be included in email newsletters
                            so that Freedocast may learn which messages have been opened and acted upon. These
                            tools may also enable Freedocast to verify online purchases by the User from the
                            Freedocast sites or from third party sites that have agreed to share such information

                            card transactions are transmitted to a financial gateway, and Freedocast endeavors

                            by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Freedocast will not disclose to

                            Freedocast uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards
                            to preserve the integrity and security of User information. Freedocast, however,

                            transmission of information, Freedocast makes commercially reasonable efforts to
                            ensure the security of its systems. However, Freedocast cannot a guarantee that
