 <strong>Effective date</strong>: September 1, 2011 /&nbsp;<strong>Last updated</strong>: September 1, 2011</p>
<p>
 This privacy policy (the “Policy”) applies to all websites owned and/or operated by Terran Marketing LLC (“TM”), including this site, www.FreeWP.com. Please read it carefully, as you are bound by its terms when using this and other TM websites. This Policy may be updated without notice at any time. Please contact us with any questions about this Policy through the <a href="/contact">Contact Form</a> or via mail at</p>

<p>
 <strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>
 TM May collect any of the following information:</p>
<p>
 <u>Information you provide</u>. When users submit contact information or provide their identifying information to the website, TM will store this information and may combine any information you submit with information provided by third parties to optimize your browsing experience. TM may also provide this information to its affiliates, business partners and third parties in order to enhance your experience, or when you authorize TM to do so in order to complete purchases and other transactions.</p>
<p>
 <u>Log information</u>. Each time users access TM’s services, TM’s servers may automatically record in its server logs information that users’ browsers sends whenever they visit a website. These server logs may include information such as users’ Internet Protocol or “IP” addresses, the date and time of the users’ requests, browser type, browser language, and one or more cookies (see description below) that may uniquely identify your browser.</p>
<p>
 <u>Links</u>. TM may present links that include codes that enable us to track whether these links have been followed. This information is used to improve the quality of TM’s advertising and customized content, as well as the organization and layout of TM’s websites.</p>
<p>
 <u>Cookies</u>. Assuming a user’s browser is configured to accept them, when users visit our websites, TM may send one or more cookies to the users’ computer or other device. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your browser. TM may also set one or more cookies in users’ browsers when they click on ads or other links presented on TM’s websites. Cookies make it possible to store user preferences and record which portions of our website you and other users are using the most. TM uses cookies solely for the purpose of improving the quality of its Service.</p>
<p>
 <u>User communications</u>. TM may retain communications that users send to TM, by email or other means, in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our Services.</p>
<p>
 <u>Affiliated TM Services on other sites</u>. From time to time, TM may offer some of its Services on or through other websites. In the event that TM offers such services, it is possible that personal information users provide to those sites may be sent to TM to facilitate delivery of those services. TM will process such information under this Policy as if the information had been submitted directly to TM from its users. Any affiliated site through which TM’s services are offered will likely have its own privacy policy, which may be very different from TM’s. It is very important for users to review the privacy policies for such affiliated sites before submitting personal information to them.</p>
<p>
 <u>Other sites</u>. This Policy only applies to services offered by TM. TM is not able to exercise control over sites that are linked to from within our various Services. These other sites may collect data, set their own cookies in users’ browsers, or ask users to provide personal information.</p>
<p>
 TM may use this information to provide, maintain, protect and improve the services it offers users. TM may also use this information to protect its rights or the rights of its users. Any of this information may be disclosed or otherwise used in any manner TM sees fit with regard to investigating and stopping the suspected or actual piracy of copyrighted content.</p>
<p>
 If TM must use any personal information in a manner different from those described, it will seek your consent prior to that use. TM possesses personal information in the United States and in other countries, and in some cases may store personal information outside of your country.</p>
<p>
 <strong>Information Sharing</strong></p>
<p>
 TM will share personal information with companies or individuals outside of TM under limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  TM has obtained your consent to release personal information.</li>
 <li>
  The information is being shared with a subsidiary or TM affiliate.</li>
 <li>
  Access, use or distribution of your personal information is, in TM’s good faith belief, reasonably required to a) satisfy an applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable government request (e.g. a warrant, subpoena or other court order), b) enforce the Terms and Conditions, and investigate their breach, c) detect and prevent security issues, d) protect against harm to TM or its users, and e) to pursue good faith allegations of piracy brought by TM or third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>
 <strong>Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>
 TM allows users the option to control their personal information (to the extent it is collected and maintained), including correcting, deleting and otherwise modifying this data. TM can fulfill this request so long as the data is not required by law or for legitimate business purposes. Users must identify themselves and the data they seek to have altered or deleted before TM will process their requests. TM may decline to process requests for which access is not required, or requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate effort, jeopardize others’ privacy, or would be unreasonable. This service is provided free of charge except where performing it would require TM to expend unreasonable effort.</p>
<p>
 Because of how TM stores personal information, data you delete may take a period of time to be deleted from our services and residual (backup) copies of website information.</p>
<p>
 <strong>Enforcement</strong></p>
<p>
 TM will regularly review its enforcement of this Policy. Upon receiving formal written complaints, it is TM’s Policy to contact the complaining user about his or her concerns. TM will cooperate with appropriate authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between TM and the complaining individual.</p>
<p>
 <strong>Changes to the Policy</strong></p>
<p>
 TM may change this Policy from time to time and without notice. TM may post significant Policy changes on this page and may provide users with more prominent notice of such changes.</p>
