            <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Service. It does not apply to sites that have linked or are
                redirected to or from the Service (“Third Party Sites”), regardless of whether or not such link or
                redirection is authorized by FreeVPN. Third Party Sites may have their own policies regarding privacy, or
                no policy at all. FreeVPN is not responsible for Third Party Sites and you use them at your own risk.
            </p>
            <h3>10. Interactions With Others</h3>
            <p>The Service may contain areas where you may be able to publicly post information, communicate with others
                such as discussion boards or blogs, review goods, services vendors, and submit media content. Such use
                is subject to our Terms of Service, and may be viewed by the public at large. Any information, including
                Personal Information, that you post there will be public, and therefore anyone who accesses such
                postings will have the ability to read, collect and further disseminate such information.
            </p>
            <h3>11. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>FreeVPN reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy. Such changes may be announced to you either by
                email or by the posting of the revised policy on the Service. You are responsible for reviewing both
                your own email and the Service to determine what is the then-current Privacy Policy.
