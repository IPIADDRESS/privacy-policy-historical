<h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
<p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>

  <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases.

<p>If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the cont  act section.</p>
<h3>Retention time</h3>
<p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for.</p>
