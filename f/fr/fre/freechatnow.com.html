<p><b><font size="4">WiredReality Privacy Policy</font></b><br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Our Principles&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
(1) We are fully committed to following laws related to the collection of data and
protecting the privacy of kids and adults, and to following our policy on data collection.<br>
<br>
(2) We are committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of each visitor.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
(3) WiredReality will not give, trade, sell, or otherwise distribute the personal
information you provide to us.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
(4) Wiredreality asks that members under 13 years of age have parental consent when
logging on the chat server, registering a nickname, posting any identifyable information,
such as email addresses, and personal information. </p>

<p>(5) A parent may contact <a href="mailto:wiredreality@wiredreality.com">WiredReality</a>
to seek assistance on their child's registration and also request that they be
removed.&nbsp; Before entering a chatroom, a member will be required to enter their age,
if they are under 13, they will be required to have a parent sign a parental consent form
and have it sent to WiredReality for approval before they are able to chat.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>WiredReality Chat&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
Registered or unregistered members may chat in WiredReality's chat rooms, which are
moderated by volunteers and a moderation robot. However, members under 13 years of age
will be required to register at WiredReality before being able to chat.&nbsp; Members are
NOT allowed to give out any information in the chat rooms that will individually identify
them. If any such information is given out, the member will be kicked from Chat. Only a
parent can determine what is appropriate for your own child. There maybe chats where the
topic or the language is not something you wish your child to participate in, its
important that you supervise your child's use of the chat area. You should teach your
child to not give out any personal information to others online.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Is WiredReality Registration Necessary?</b><br>
<br>
Registering on WiredReality is only necessary for members under 13 years of age for
parental consent reasons.&nbsp; All members over 13 may register if they please, but it is
not required.<br>
</p>

<p><b>What Information Does WiredReality Collect?&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
WiredReality does not require a member to submit his/her full name, address, etc when
registering and filling out a profile on the chat network. We only collect information you
voluntarily supply us. A member may choose to leave this blank, profiles may be filled in
at the descression of a members parents. WiredReality does not collect email addresses
from members. We stress parental involvement and permission before you supply information
on our Web site. We do not ask for real names or postal addresses. Instead you are invited
to supply any nickname not registered by another member. WiredReality does not encourage
members under 13 years of age to post personally identifyable information without parental
consent.<br>
<br>
Here is a list of the information WiredReality requests on its registration form:<br>
<br>
* WiredReality Name (this username is created and used only for access to
WiredReality)&nbsp;<br>
* Password (this password is created and used only for access to WiredReality)<br>
* IP Address&nbsp; - The IP address is not requested, but is shown on the Wired Profile.
&nbsp; This is used to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web
site.&nbsp; We also track the total number of visitors to our site.&nbsp; Personally
identifiable information is not taken in this process.<br>
<br>
This information is left to the user to fill in on his/her profile, and is not required to
be filled in.<br>
<br>
* First Name&nbsp;- A member may choose to write their nickname here.<br>
* Info - A member may choose to write anything in this area.<br>
* Email - A member may choose to post their email address<br>
* URL&nbsp; -&nbsp; A members may choose to list thier favorite website.<br>
</p>

<p>The WiredReality profile is available to registered members only.&nbsp; The profile can
be seen when a member double clicks another members nickname.&nbsp; The profile is a way
of other members being able to learn a little bit about you before they begin to chat with
you.&nbsp; You may choose to fill in this profile at your descresion, it is perfectly fine
to leave your profile blank.<br>
Note:&nbsp; Membership is only required by members under 13 years of age.<br>
<br>
