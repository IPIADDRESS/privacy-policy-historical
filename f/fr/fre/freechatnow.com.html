Guidelines come into effect once the ages 7-12 chatroom on <a href="http://www.preteenchat.com">http://www.preteenchat.com</a> comes back online.
&nbsp; Currently members under 13 years of age barred from the chatrooms after identifying
their age.&nbsp; Once the chatroom comes back online, members will be taken to a link to
the 7-12 chatroom after identifying that they are 12 years of age and under.&nbsp; When
taken to that room, before entry they will need a parent to fax a signed form stating they
give their child permission to chat.&nbsp; After WiredReality checks the form, the child
will then be granted access.&nbsp; Once they are granted access, the following guidelines
come into effect:</small></font></p>
