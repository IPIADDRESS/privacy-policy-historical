<p><b>INFORMATION
FreeTypingGame.net GATHERS AND TRACKS</b></p>

<p>FreeTypingGame.net
gathers two types of information about users:</p>

<ul type="disc">
 <li>Information that users
     provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary
     submissions to receive our electronic scoreboards, to participate in our
     message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in
     polls and surveys:</li>
 <li>Information FreeTypingGame.net
     gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying
     page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better
     tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and
     sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because FreeTypingGame.net
     derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing
     such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free
     to users. Under no circumstances does FreeTypingGame.net divulge any
     information about an individual user to a third party. </li>
</ul>

<p>FreeTypingGame.net
Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:</p>

<p><b>Optional
Voluntary Information</b></p>

<p>We
offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary
submission of personal information by users:</p>

<p><b>1.
"E-mail this to a friend" policy</b></p>

<p>Our
site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents to
someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must
provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information
is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the
recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other
purpose.</p>

<p><b>2.
Polling</b></p>

<p>We
may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions
with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues.
Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to
any particular user. FreeTypingGame.net may use a system to "tag"
users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular
question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.</p>

<p><b>3.
Surveys</b></p>

<p>FreeTypingGame.net
may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our
audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these
surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this
information about specific individuals with any third party.</p>

<p><b>Children</b></p>

<p>Consistent
with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we
will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone
under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.</p>

<p><b>Usage
tracking</b></p>

<p>FreeTypingGame.net
tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not
correlate this information with data about individual users. FreeTypingGame.net
does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name,
browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string
(information contained in every user's browser).</p>

<p>FreeTypingGame.net
sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search
function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use
tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't
like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users
read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to
build a better service for you.</p>

<p><b>Cookies</b></p>

<p>We
may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your
computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it
will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have
specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie
can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off
your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. FreeTypingGame.net
uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our
advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions
and click rates.</p>

<p>You
can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your
browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning
message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this
site. However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards,
forums, polling and surveys.</p>

<p><b>USE
OF INFORMATION</b></p>

<p>FreeTypingGame.net
uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience
in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized
elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the
interests of our users.</p>

<p>As
stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to
send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls,
surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers on
a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out
special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in
something we are doing. FreeTypingGame.net never shares newsletter mailing
lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.</p>

<p>When
we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like
and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual
users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us
continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in
Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we
don't track which terms a particular user enters.</p>

<p>FreeTypingGame.net
creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for
advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise
more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are
pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of
individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user
clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual
user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect
the personal safety of our users or the public.</p>

<p><b>SHARING
OF THE INFORMATION</b></p>

<p>FreeTypingGame.net
uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs
and help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. This is
essential to keeping our service free. We will not share information about
individual users with any third party, except to comply with applicable law or
valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the
public.</p>

<p><b>SECURITY</b></p>

<p>FreeTypingGame.net
operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and
password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically
reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access
to the information provided by our customers.</p>

<p><b>OPT-OUT
POLICY</b></p>

<p>We
give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Opting not to
     register to receive our electronic newsletters.</li>
 <li>Opting not to
     participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the
     need to gather any personally identifiable information from our users </li>      
</ul>

<p><b>YOUR
CONSENT</b></p>

<p>By
using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by FreeTypingGame.net.
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this
page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use
it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
