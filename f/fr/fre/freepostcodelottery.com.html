<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(1)	This privacy policy</p>
<p>This privacy policy was made using an SEQ Legal privacy policy template created for http://www.employmentlawcontracts.co.uk.</p>
<p>(2)	What information do we collect?</p>
<p>We collect, store and use the following  personal information:</p>
<p>(a)	information that you provide to us for the purpose of registering with us (including your postcode and email address);</p>
<p>(b)  Your IP address is stored with your personal information for security only.  This helps us identify the source in cases where the site is being abused.  For example, identifying fraudulent entries.</p>
<p>(3)	Cookies</p>
<p>A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. </p>
<p>We use “persistent” cookies on the website.  We will use the persistent cookies to: enable our website to recognise you when you visit. </p>
<p>Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.</p>
<p>We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website.  Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users’ computers.  The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information.  Google’s privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html.</p>
<p>We log users’ access of the site for security purposes only.</p>
<p>Our advertisers may also send you cookies.</p>
<p>We publish Google Adsense interest-based advertisements on our website.  These are tailored by Google to reflect your interests.  To determine your interests, Google will track your behaviour across the web using cookies.  You can view, delete or add interest categories associated with your browser using Google’s Ads Preference Manager, available at: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/.  You can opt-out of the Adsense partner network cookie at: http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.  However, this opt-out mechanism uses a cookie, and if you clear the cookies from your browser your opt-out will not be maintained. To ensure that an opt-out is maintained in respect of a particular browser, you should use the Google browser plug-in available at: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin.</p>
<p>We publish links to other sites that pay us commission for traffic and/or resulting leads.  There is no obligation for our users to click on these links.</p>
<p>Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third party cookies.  For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector.  Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.</p>
<p>(4)	Using your personal information</p>

<p>(d)	send you general (non-marketing) commercial communications;</p>
<p>(e)	send you email notifications which you have specifically requested;</p>

<p>(5) 	Disclosures</p>
<p>We may disclose information about you to any of our employees, suppliers or subcontractors insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes as set out in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>In addition, we may disclose your personal information: </p>
<p>(a)	to the extent that we are required to do so by law;</p>
<p>(b)	in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings;</p>
<p>(c)	in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk);</p>
<p>(d)	to the purchaser (or prospective purchaser) of any business or asset which we are (or are contemplating) selling; and</p>
<p>(e)	to any person who we reasonably believe may apply to a court or other competent authority for disclosure of that personal information where, in our reasonable opinion, such court or authority would be reasonably likely to order disclosure of that personal information.</p>
<p>Except as provided in this privacy policy, we will not provide your information to third parties.</p>
<p>(6)	International data transfers</p>
<p>Information that we collect may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate in order to enable us to use the information in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

<p>We may withhold such personal information to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>You may instruct us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes by email at any time.  In practice, you will usually either expressly agree in advance to our use of your personal information for marketing purposes, or we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of the use of your personal information for marketing purposes.</p>
