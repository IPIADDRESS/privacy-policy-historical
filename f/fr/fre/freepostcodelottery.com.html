<p>We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.</p><p></p>

<p>(1)	This privacy policy</p>

<p>This privacy policy was made using an SEQ Legal privacy policy template created for http://www.employmentlawcontracts.co.uk.</p>

<p>(2)	What information do we collect?</p>

<p>(a)	information that you provide to us for the purpose of registering with us (including your postcode and email address);</p>

<p>(b)  Your IP address is stored with your personal information for security only.  This helps us identify the source in cases where the site is being abused.  For example, identifying fraudulent entries.</p>

<p>(3)	Cookies</p>

<p>A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. </p>

<p>We use "persistent" cookies on the website.  We will use the persistent cookies to: enable our website to recognise you when you visit. </p>

<p>Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.</p>

<p>We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website.  Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers.  The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information.  Google's privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html.</p>

<p>We log users' access of the site for security purposes only.</p>

<p>Our advertisers may also send you cookies.</p>

<p>We publish Google Adsense interest-based advertisements on our website.  These are tailored by Google to reflect your interests.  To determine your interests, Google will track your behaviour across the web using cookies.  You can view, delete or add interest categories associated with your browser using Google's Ads Preference Manager, available at: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/.  You can opt-out of the Adsense partner network cookie at: http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.  However, this opt-out mechanism uses a cookie, and if you clear the cookies from your browser your opt-out will not be maintained. To ensure that an opt-out is maintained in respect of a particular browser, you should use the Google browser plug-in available at: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin.</p>

<p>We publish links to other sites that pay us commission for traffic and/or resulting leads.  There is no obligation for our users to click on these links.</p>

For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking "Tools", "Internet Options", "Privacy", and selecting "Block all cookies" using the sliding selector.  Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.</p>
