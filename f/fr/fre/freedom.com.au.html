            <h2>Other information we may collect</h2> 

			<p>For statistical purposes we collect anonymous information on web site activity (such as top pages viewed, the number of pages viewed, the number of sessions, most popular session times). We use this data to evaluate our web site performance and to improve the content we display to you. </p>

                <li>For planning, product development or research purposes.</li>
            </ul>
			
            <h2>Use and disclosure of personal information</h2>
			
            <p>We will only send personal information about you to other organisations when:</p>

                <li>We are required or authorised by law to disclose the information.</li>

            <h2>Third-party ad serving </h2>
            <p>Freedom uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick.

With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
