			<br>
			Your information is collected via two ways.

The first two cookies just contain a user identifier (hereinafter "user-id") and an anonymous session identifier (hereinafter "session-id"), automatically assigned to you by the phpBB software. A third cookie will be created once you have browsed topics within the "FreeFileSync Forum" and is used to store which topics have been read, thereby improving your user experience.<br>
			<br>
			We may also create cookies external to the phpBB software whilst browsing the "FreeFileSync Forum", though these are outside the scope of this section which is intended to only cover the pages created by the phpBB software. The second way in which we collect your information is by what you submit to us. This can be, and is not limited to: posting as an anonymous user, registering on the "FreeFileSync Forum" (hereinafter "your account") and posts submitted by you after registration and whilst logged in (hereinafter "your posts").<br>
			<br>
			Your account will at a bare minimum contain a uniquely identifiable name (hereinafter "your user name"), a personal password used for logging into your account (hereinafter "your password") and a personal, valid email address (hereinafter "your email").

Any information beyond your user name, your password, and your email address required by the "FreeFileSync Forum" during the registration process is either mandatory or optional, at the discretion of the "FreeFileSync Forum". In all cases, you have the option of what information in your account is publicly displayed. Furthermore, within your account, you have the option to opt-in or opt-out of automatically generated emails from the phpBB software.<br>
			<br>
			Your password is ciphered (a one-way hash) so that it is secure. However, it is recommended that you do not reuse the same password across a number of different websites. Your password is the means of accessing your account at the "FreeFileSync Forum", so please guard it carefully and under no circumstance will anyone affiliated with the "FreeFileSync Forum", phpBB or another 3rd party, legitimately ask you for your password. Should you forget your password for your account, you can use the "I forgot my password" feature provided by the phpBB software. This process will ask you to submit your user name and your email, then the phpBB software will generate a new password to reclaim your account.
