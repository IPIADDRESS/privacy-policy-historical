<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your Acceptance of this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>By using the Websites, Apps or delPlaya Media Service, including, without limitation, responding to offers, exchanging information about your personal preferences, and continuing to receive information from delPlaya Media, you agree to accept the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, and you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information as described herein. This Privacy Policy is subject to the Terms of Use found at:&nbsp;<a href="http://delplaya.com/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a> which is incorporated herein by this reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information We Collect</p>
<p>If you choose to share your personal information with us we will collect and retain information that may personally identify you (such as your name, location, mobile device identifier, physical address, telephone number, email address, billing information, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you decide not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Websites, Apps or delPlaya Media Service or other services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if you choose not to share your personal information, we may automatically collect non-personal information, including, but not limited to, IP (internet protocol) address, location, ISP (internet service provider), the Web browser used to visit the Websites, Apps or delPlaya Media Service, length and time of visit, the pages visited, a unique mobile device identifier and other usage data delPlaya Media may collect from time to time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use “cookies” (small files placed on your computer to help optimize performance), single pixel GIF image files (also called “Pixels” or “Web beacons”), Web server log analysis and other similar technologies, and other tracking technology (such as Flash Persistent Storage) that help us manage and track your interaction with the Websites, Apps and delPlaya Media Service. We may share such information with third parties. We track the music played through the delPlaya Media Service and report it to our third party partners in the aggregate in order to meet their obligation to report and pay copyright owners and for other lawful uses, including analytics and marketing undertaken by those third parties. These reports do not contain personally-identifiable information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We work with third party online advertising networks to deliver advertising on the Websites, Apps and delPlaya Media Service. Such third parties may utilize cookies or other tracking and targeting technologies. We are not responsible for information collected by third party advertisers in this manner, nor for the collection or use of information by other sites to which the Websites, Apps or delPlaya Media Service is linked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers, ad networks, and websites for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. Any data obtained by third-party ad servers subsequently shared with us is maintained and dealt with by us in accordance with this privacy policy. When you access the Websites, Apps or delPlaya Media Service through a service partner, we may add your email address or other personalized information, so that we can identify which of our service partners or other sign-in pages to send to you when you log on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also collect information about the devices you use to access the Websites, Apps or delPlaya Media Service. This information may include your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. We also may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information We Receive From Third Parties</p>
<p>We may receive information about you from third parties and store it in our databases with personally identifiable information that you provide to us. These third parties may include advertisers that make features available through the Websites, Apps or delPlaya Media Service, access partners, and marketing companies that create or sell other marketing data. delPlaya Media is only responsible for abiding by its own privacy policy and will assume no liability if a business partner or other entity collects, uses or shares any information about you in violation of its own privacy policy or applicable law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use of Information</p>
<p>We use your personal information and non-personal information to provide you with services, to notify you of new products or services, and communicate with you. We also use the information that we collect for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To customize and personalize the advertising and the content you see and hear.</li>

<li>To fulfill your requests to receive information or services and permit you to interact with the Websites, Apps or delPlaya Media Service.</li>
<li>To send you alerts on developments and features that may be of interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consent to Sharing Information</p>
<p>We may rent, sell, and share your personal information and non-personal information with our network partners and third-party affiliates for the purposes of direct mail, email marketing, mobile marketing, and telemarketing. Additionally, we may share such personal information with the broadcaster to whose station you use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By providing personal information to us you agree:</p>
<ul>
<li>all information you have provided is true and correct to the best of your knowledge;</li>
<li>you are establishing a business relationship with delPlaya Media and with its advertising and marketing partners; and</li>
<li>you are requesting and expressly consenting to be contacted via telephone (whether wireless or wired), including by live or prerecorded, calls using an automated dialing system, email, and/or mail by us, our network partners, and third-party affiliates and marketing partners regardless of whether your telephone number is on any Do Not Call list(s)</li>
<li>From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses and third party marketing partners whom we believe trustworthy and who have confirmed that their privacy practices are consistent with ours (“Service Providers”). For example, we may contract with Service Providers and third-party marketing partners to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, customer relationship management, data storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We provide our Service Providers and/or third-party marketing partners with the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each Service Provider and/or third-party marketing partner must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may work with third-party marketing and advertising companies (“Ad Networks”).

It also does not cover any information that you may choose to provide to an Ad Network or to an advertiser whose goods or services are advertised through the Websites, Apps or delPlaya Media Service. For such information, you are subject to the terms of the Ad Networks’ privacy policy. We may share personal information and non-personal information with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with delPlaya Media. If delPlaya Media is merged, acquired, or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer personal information and non-personal information in connection with such transaction. We shall also cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose personal information and non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in our discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate in order to respond to legal requests (including court orders and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property or rights of delPlaya Media or of any third party, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children’s Privacy</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we receive personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records once we learn of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>External Links</p>
<p>The Websites, Apps or delPlaya Media Service may contain links to other sites, or allow others to send you such links. A link to a third party’s site does not mean that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it. We do not exercise control over third-party sites. You access such third-party sites or content at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a third- party site before providing any information to the site.</p>
