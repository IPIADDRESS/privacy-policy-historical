            <h1>FreddieMac.com Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>Freddie Mac recognizes the importance of maintaining
        the privacy of your personal and financial information.
        We are committed to privacy practices that protect
        the confidentiality and security of this information.
        Our information practices for personal and financial
        information you enter or that we collect exclusively
        through your use of FreddieMac.com website are set
        forth below. Freddie Mac does not collect, store
        or use any such information that is obtained through
        this website, except as described below. </p>
      <h2><b>Information We Collect </b></h2>
      <p>If you visit FreddieMac.com to read or download
        information, we collect and store: the name of the
        domain and host from which you access the Internet
        (such as aol.com); the Internet protocol address
        of the host server you are using (such as ww3.aol.com);
        the name and version of your Web browser (such as
        Netscape 4.0); the date and time you access FreddieMac.com; and, if you came to us through a link
        from some other website, the Internet address of
        the website from which you linked to us. We do not
        collect your name or email address. No information
        we collect in this way is directly or indirectly
        traceable back to a specific person. </p>
      <p>We use this information for general statistical
        modeling, in order to measure the number of visitors
        to different pages on FreddieMac.com and
        to modify FreddieMac.com in order to make
        FreddieMac.com more helpful. We also use
        this information to monitor network traffic and to
        identify unauthorized access or unusual activity
        on FreddieMac.com. We do not sell this information
        to third party companies. </p>
      <p>Some parts of FreddieMac.com may use a
        "cookie," which is a small text file that
        is placed on your computer's hard drive. The cookie
        captures no personally identifiable information.
        FreddieMac.com may use a cookie in order
        to log which pages you visit on FreddieMac.com
        or to provide certain features during your visit
        to FreddieMac.com. You can set your browser
        to refuse to accept cookies; however, some enhancement
        features of FreddieMac.com may
        not function properly if you do this. </p>
      <h2><b>Information You Provide</b></h2>
      <p>If you send us an email or message and provide your
        name or other personal and financial information,
        we may keep this information. We may use this information
        to send an answer to your question or deliver requested
        information to you. We also may use information that
        you provide to measure general statistics about visits
        to FreddieMac.com and interest in particular
        areas. We do not sell this information to third party
        companies. By sending an email or making a request
        or inquiry, you agree to permit Freddie Mac to keep
        and use the information you have given us consistent
        with this policy. </p>
      <p>If you enter personal and financial information
        into a financing or affordability calculator offered
        on FreddieMac.com — such as income, the down
        payment you want to make, the length of a loan you
        want, the price of a home you have in mind — that
        information is not seen or received by Freddie Mac.
        The calculator's functions are performed by your
        computer and the results are displayed in your browser
        and viewable only by you. </p>
      <p>If you enter information in an online form to register
        as a Freddie Mac business customer or as a user of
        Loan Prospector or other business tools, we may keep
        this information. We may use the business information
        that you provide in the registration in order to
        verify your eligibility to use FreddieMac.com
        or business tool that you wish to use, or to provide
        you access to the service. Information that you provide
        in this manner also may be used to measure general
        statistics about visits to FreddieMac.com
        and interest in particular areas. We do not sell
        the information you provide in this manner to third
        party companies. Except as described in this paragraph
        and in the following paragraph, FreddieMac.com privacy policy statement does not apply to
        information provided to us by business entities,
        even if the information is transmitted to us through
        FreddieMac.com. </p>
      <p>If you are a business customer and you use FreddieMac.com in the course of business with
        Freddie Mac, then information that you submit may
        be used and disclosed in the same ways as information
        that we receive outside of FreddieMac.com.
        For example, information you provide concerning borrowers
        whose loans Freddie Mac purchases may be disclosed
        to certain third parties such as loan servicers,
        consumer reporting agencies, workout companies and
        foreclosure attorneys in order to process and administer
        a loan or protect our interest in a loan. Freddie
        Mac requires servicers and other third parties to
        follow appropriate security and confidentiality standards
        to protect borrower information. In addition, information
        about borrowers that you provide may be aggregated
        and used for risk management, predicting borrower
        creditworthiness, establishing loan-to-value ratios
        and evaluating borrower defaults. Freddie Mac releases
        borrower information when required by law or regulation,
        such as to respond to a subpoena or other judicial
        process or to comply with requests from our regulators.</p>
      <p>Freddie Mac does not sell or disclose the information
        received concerning borrowers whose loans it purchases
        to third party companies for marketing purposes.</p>
      <h2><b>Security</b></h2>
      <p>Freddie Mac has adopted policies and practices designed
        to protect the security and confidentiality of borrower
        and consumer information, to protect against anticipated
        threats and hazards to security and integrity of
        the information and to protect against unauthorized
        access to or use of the information that could result
        in substantial harm or inconvenience. Freddie Mac
        uses a variety of security measures to protect the
        transmission of information submitted to us through
        FreddieMac.com. </p>
      <h2><b>Changes to This Privacy Statement</b></h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to revise or change this policy
        in the future. Any changes to our policy will be
        clearly and conspicuously posted on this section
        of FreddieMac.com. </p>
      <h2><b>How to Reach Us</b></h2>
      <p>If you have a question about the way that your information
        is used or about Freddie Mac's information practices
        with respect to this site, please <a href="/corporate/about/contactus.htm">contact
