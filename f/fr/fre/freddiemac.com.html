<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>


<p>Freddie Mac is a government-sponsored enterprise chartered by  Congress to provide a continuous flow of funds for residential mortgages. We  achieve our public purpose by purchasing, securitizing and investing in home  mortgages, in effect acting as a conduit between the residential mortgage  market and the investment community. We may receive personal information about  you in the ordinary course of carrying out our business. We are committed to  protecting the privacy of this information.</p>

<p>This privacy policy describes the types of personally identifiable  information about borrowers and other individuals that we receive (Covered  Information) and what we do with the information. The policy also describes how  we safeguard Covered Information. The policy does not apply to information we  receive about or from businesses, other than Website Visitor Information (as  defined below). The policy also does not apply to information that may be  collected by third parties through websites that link to or from this website.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change this policy in the future. Any  changes to this policy will be posted on this section of the website. When this  policy is updated, the date of the update will appear at the bottom of this  page. In addition, a copy of this policy is available upon request by writing  to Freddie Mac, Chief Privacy Officer, 8200 Jones Branch Drive, Mailstop 434, McLean, Virginia 22102-3110 or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy_inquiries@freddiemac.com">privacy_inquiries@freddiemac.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Personally Identifiable Information  We Receive and Maintain in the Ordinary Course of Our Business</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We receive Covered       Information about borrowers and loan applicants when we engage in our       secondary market activities. For example, we may receive Covered       Information (such as income information, payment history, social security       number and other information provided by consumer reporting agencies,       mortgage lenders and dealers) when evaluating whether to purchase a loan,       when consummating the purchase of a loan or when reviewing information       about loans in which we already have an interest. </li>
  <li>We collect Covered       Information from brokers and third party originator direct principals and       directors who register for our proprietary services, such as Loan       Prospector, or from individuals seeking bulk sales information from the       Home Steps program.</li>
  <li>We receive Covered       Information from individuals interested in pursuing employment with       Freddie Mac and from our employees. </li>
  <li>We receive Covered       Information from other individuals who choose to contact us and provide us       with information, including information we receive through this website       (see below for details). </li>
  <li>We maintain all of       the foregoing information in the ordinary course of business. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Personally Identifiable Information  We Receive Through This Website </h2>

<p>If you visit this website to read or download information, we  collect and store the following information (Website Visitor Information), some  of which constitutes personally identifiable information: the name of the  domain and host from which you access the Internet, such as aol.com; the  Internet protocol address of the host server you are using, such as  ww3.aol.com; the name and version of your Web browser, such as Internet  Explorer; the date and time you access this website; if you came to us through  a link from some other website, the Internet address of the website from which  you linked to us; and your name and other personal information you may provide  to us in an email or other message.</p>

<p>Some parts of this website may use a "cookie," which is  a small file that is placed on your computer or other internet-connected  device. The cookie captures no personally identifiable information. This  website may use a cookie in order to log which pages you visit on the website  or to provide certain features during your visit to the website. You can set  your browser to refuse to accept cookies; however, some features of the website  may not function properly if you do this.</p>

<p>If you enter information into a financing or affordability  calculator offered on this website (such as income, the down payment you want  to make, the length of a loan you want or the price of a home you have in  mind), that information is not seen or received by Freddie Mac. Your computer  performs the calculator's functions, and the results are displayed in your  browser.</p>

<h2>What We Do With Information Covered  by This Policy</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We use and disclose       Covered Information in connection with our secondary marketing activities       and for other legally permissible purposes related to our business. For       example, we use Covered Information to evaluate loans in which we are       considering acquiring an interest and to monitor the performance of loans       that we own. We also use this information to evaluate property values and       predict default. </li>
  <li>We provide Covered       Information to third parties such as loan servicers, consumer reporting       agencies, workout companies, foreclosure attorneys and technology       providers to enable the third parties to perform business, professional       and technical support functions for us, our website or you. For example,       we may disclose Covered Information to third parties in order to process       and administer or protect our interest in a loan or to assist us with this       website. </li>
  <li>We use Covered       Information for purposes of research related to our business, our public       purpose and this website. We may publish the results of our research, but       we will not publish personally identifiable information about you in       connection with the research. </li>
  <li>We use Covered       Information to establish customer relationships with brokers and third       party originator direct principals and officers.</li>
  <li>We disclose Covered       Information to our regulators and as otherwise required by applicable laws       and regulations. We otherwise comply with applicable laws and regulations       in our use and disclosure of Covered Information. </li>
  <li>We use and disclose       Covered Information about our employees, as we deem appropriate for       purposes related to the employment relationship in compliance with       applicable laws and regulations. </li>
  <li>We use Website       Visitor Information for general statistical modeling, in order to measure       the number of visitors to different pages on the website and to modify and       enhance the website as we consider appropriate. We also use this       information to monitor network traffic and to identify unauthorized access       or unusual activity on the website. </li>
  <li>If you send us an       email or message and provide your name or other personal information, we       may use this information to send an answer to your question or to deliver       the requested information or service to you. We also may use this       information to provide you with information in which we believe you will       be interested; however, at any time, you may request that we stop doing       this by contacting us in the manner described in the "How to Reach       Us" section of this policy. </li>
  <li>We do not sell       Covered Information to consumer marketing companies and have no plans to       do so. </li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Safeguard Personally  Identifiable Information </h2>

<p>Freddie Mac has administrative, technical and physical safeguards  to protect the security and confidentiality of Covered Information that we  receive, transmit and maintain, including computer files and documents that  contain the information. Our standards are designed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Protect the       security and confidentiality of the information, </li>
  <li>Protect against       anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the       information, and </li>
  <li>Protect against       unauthorized access to or use of the information that could result in       substantial harm or inconvenience to a borrower, consumer or employee. </li>
</ul>

<p>We restrict access to Covered Information to those who need to  know the information for our business purposes. We destroy, erase or make  unreadable such information prior to disposal as required by applicable law.  Our policies and our agreements with third parties require appropriate security  and confidentiality standards to protect the confidentiality of Covered  Information (including Website Visitor Information) and prohibit its unlawful  disclosure. </p>

<p>We strive to maintain a high standard of security and privacy.  However, no information can be guaranteed to be completely secure, and we make  no such warranty or guarantee. In addition, we do not commit to protecting  publicly available or non-confidential information except as may be required by  applicable law or regulation. </p>

<h2>Special Statement Regarding the  "Does Freddie Mac Own Your Mortgage?" Web Form and Self‚ÄìService Tool</h2>
<p>In connection with the federal <em>Making Home Affordable</em> program,  Freddie Mac has begun to provide a web form and related self-service tool on  Freddiemac.com that enables individual borrowers to determine whether or not  Freddie Mac owns their mortgage (the "Look-up Tool"). In order for  Freddie Mac to be able to respond to those inquiries, individuals are asked to  provide information that includes their Social Security number, first name,  last name, property-related information and contact information. </p>

<p>Freddie Mac uses and discloses the information collected via the  Look-up Tool only (i) to respond to the individual's inquiry, (ii) to provide  services and fulfill Freddie Mac's obligations under the federal <em>Making Home  Affordable</em> program and similar programs, and (iii) in connection with other  loss mitigation activities. All information that you enter into the Look-up  Tool is transmitted from the Look-up Tool to Freddie Mac via an encrypted  communication channel. </p>

<p>We do not store, use or distribute the Social Security number  collected via the Look-up Tool for any purpose other than to respond to the  inquiry. </p>
  
<h2>How to Reach Us</h2>

<p>If you have a question about the way your information is used or  about our information practices, please contact us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy_inquiries@freddiemac.com">privacy_inquiries@freddiemac.com</a>.</p>
