      <p>Freddie Mac is a government-sponsored  enterprise chartered by Congress to provide a continuous flow of funds for  residential mortgages. We achieve our  public purpose by purchasing, securitizing and  investing in home mortgages, in effect acting as a conduit between the  residential mortgage market and the investment community. We may receive personal information about  you in the ordinary course of carrying out our business. We are committed to protecting the privacy  of this information.</p>
      <p>This privacy policy describes the types of personally  identifiable information about borrowers and other individuals that we receive  (Covered Information) and what we do with the information. The policy also describes how we safeguard  Covered Information. The policy does  not apply to information we receive about or from businesses, other than  Website Visitor Information (as defined below). The policy also does not apply to information that may be  collected by third parties through websites that link to or from this website.</p>
      <p>We  reserve the right to change this policy in the future. Any changes to this policy will be posted on this  section of the website. When this  policy is updated, the date of the update will appear at the bottom of this  page. In addition, a copy of this policy is  available upon request by writing to Freddie Mac, Chief Privacy Officer, 8200  Jones Branch Drive, Mailstop 434, McLean, Virginia 22102-3110 or by sending an  email to <a href="mailto:privacy_inquiries@freddiemac.com">privacy_inquiries@freddiemac.com</a>.</p>
	  
      <h2>Personally  Identifiable Information We Receive and Maintain in the Ordinary Course of Our  Business</h2>
      
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p>We receive Covered Information about borrowers and loan applicants  when we engage in our secondary market activities. For example, we may receive Covered Information (such as income  information, payment history, social security number and other information  provided by consumer reporting agencies, mortgage lenders and dealers) when  evaluating whether to purchase a loan, when consummating the purchase of a loan or  when reviewing information about loans in which we already have an interest.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li><p>We receive Covered Information from individuals interested in  pursuing employment with Freddie Mac and from our employees.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>We receive Covered Information from other individuals who choose  to contact us and provide us with information, including information we receive  through this website (see below for details).</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>We maintain all of the foregoing information in the ordinary  course of business.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Personally  Identifiable Information We Receive Through This Website </h2>
      <p>If  you visit this website to read or download information, we collect and store  the following information (Website Visitor Information), some of which  constitutes personally identifiable information: the name of the domain and  host from which you access the Internet, such as aol.com; the Internet protocol  address of the host server you are using, such as ww3.aol.com; the name and  version of your Web browser, such as Netscape 4.0; the date and time you access  this website; if you came to us through a link from some other website, the  Internet address of the website from which you linked to us; and your name and  other personal information you may provide to us in an email or other  message.</p>
      <p>Some  parts of this website may use a "cookie," which is a small text file  that is placed on your computer's hard drive. The cookie captures no personally  identifiable information. This website  may use a cookie in order to log which pages you visit on the website or to provide  certain features during your visit to the website. You can set your browser to  refuse to accept cookies; however, some features of the website may not  function properly if you do this.</p>
      <p>If  you enter information into a financing or affordability calculator offered on  this website (such as income, the down payment you want to make, the length of  a loan you want or the price of a home you have in mind), that information is  not seen or received by Freddie Mac.  Your computer performs the calculator's functions, and the results are  displayed in your browser.</p>
      <h2>What We Do With  Information Covered by This Policy</h2>
    
      <ul class="list">
        <li><p>We use and disclose Covered Information in connection with  our secondary marketing activities and for other legally permissible  purposes related to our business. For  example, we use Covered Information to evaluate loans  in which we are considering acquiring an interest and to monitor the  performance of loans that we own. We  also use this information to evaluate property values and predict default. </p>
       </li>
        <li><p>We provide Covered Information to third parties such as  loan servicers, consumer reporting agencies, workout companies, foreclosure  attorneys and technology providers to enable the third parties to  perform business, professional and technical support functions for us, our  website or you.  For example, we may disclose Covered Information  to third parties in order to process and administer or protect our interest in  a loan or to assist us with this website.</p></li>
      
        <li><p>We  use Covered Information for purposes of research related to our business, our  public purpose and this website. We may  publish the results of our research, but we will not publish personally  identifiable information about you in connection with the research.</p> </li>
      
        <li><p>We disclose Covered Information to our regulators and as  otherwise required by applicable laws and regulations. We otherwise comply with applicable laws and  regulations in our use and disclosure of Covered Information.</p></li>
      
        <li><p>We use and disclose Covered Information about  our employees, as we deem appropriate for purposes related to the employment  relationship in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p></li>
        <li><p>We  use Website Visitor Information for general statistical modeling, in order to  measure the number of visitors to different pages on the website and to modify  and enhance the website as we consider appropriate. We also use this information to monitor network traffic and to  identify unauthorized access or unusual activity on the website.</p></li>
      
        <li><p>If  you send us an email or message and provide your name or other personal  information, we may use this information to send an answer to your question or  to deliver the requested information or service to you. We also may use this  information to provide you with information in which we believe you will be  interested; however, at any time, you may request that we stop doing this by  contacting us in the manner described in the "How to Reach Us" section of this  policy.</p> </li>
      
        <li><p>We do not sell Covered Information to consumer marketing  companies and have no plans to do so.</p></li>
      </ul>
	  	  
	  
      <h2>How We Safeguard Personally  Identifiable Information </h2>
      <p>Freddie Mac has administrative,  technical and physical safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality  of Covered  Information that we receive, transmit and maintain,  including computer files and documents that contain the information. Our standards are designed to:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Protect the security and confidentiality of the information,</li>
        <li>Protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or  integrity of the information, and</li>
        <li>Protect against unauthorized access to or use of the information  that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to a borrower, consumer  or employee. </li>
      </ul>
   
      <p>We restrict access to Covered Information to those who need to know the information for our business  purposes. We destroy, erase or make  unreadable such information prior to disposal as required by applicable  law. Our policies and our agreements  with third parties require appropriate security and confidentiality standards  to protect the confidentiality of Covered Information (including Website Visitor Information) and prohibit its  unlawful disclosure. </p>
      <p>We  strive to maintain a high standard of security and privacy. However, no information can be guaranteed to  be completely secure, and we make no such warranty or guarantee. In addition, we do not commit to protecting publicly available or non-confidential information except as may be required by applicable law or regulation. </p>

	 <h2>Special Statement Regarding the "Does Freddie  Mac Own Your Mortgage?" Web Form and Self–Service Tool</h2>

<p>In connection with the federal <em>Making Home Affordable</em> program,  Freddie Mac has begun to provide a web form and related self-service tool on  Freddiemac.com that enables individual borrowers to determine whether or not  Freddie Mac owns their mortgage (the "Look-up Tool"). In order for Freddie Mac to be able to respond to those  inquiries, individuals are asked to provide information that includes their Social  Security number, first name, last name, property-related information and  contact information. </p>

<p>Freddie Mac uses and  discloses the information collected via the Look-up Tool only (i) to respond to  the individual's inquiry, (ii) to provide services and fulfill Freddie Mac's  obligations under the federal <em>Making Home  Affordable</em> program and similar programs, and (iii) in connection with other  loss mitigation activities. All  information that you enter into the Look-up Tool is transmitted from the  Look-up Tool to Freddie Mac via an encrypted communication channel. </p>
<p>We do not store, use or distribute the Social Security number collected via the Look-up Tool for any purpose other than to respond to the inquiry. </p>
</div>
<h2>How to Reach Us</h2>
      <p>If  you have a question about the way your information is used or about our  information practices, please contact us by sending an email to  <a href="mailto:privacy_inquiries@freddiemac.com">privacy_inquiries@freddiemac.com</a>.<strong></strong></p>
