                  of our many offerings. This policy may change from time to

                  What personally identifiable information does Freeze.com

                  Freeze.com collects information in several ways from different
                  parts of our network of web sites. Some personal information
                  is gathered when you register. During registration, Freeze.com
                  asks for your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip
                  code, occupation, industry and personal interests. The more
                  information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the
                  better we are able to customize your experience. Once you
                  register you are no longer anonymous to Freeze.com; you are
                  given a Freeze.com ID and are able to take full advantage of
                  Freeze.com's many offerings.<br>
                  <br>
                  In addition to registration we may ask you for personal
                  information at other times, including (but not limited to)
                  when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored
                  by Freeze.com and/or our many partners; request access to our
                  entertainment or computer utilities offerings, etc., or agree
                  to download our content for your use. If you contact
                  Freeze.com, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
                  Freeze.com also occasionally asks users to complete surveys
                  that we use for research purposes. Wherever Freeze.com
                  collects personal information, we make an effort to include a
                  link to this Privacy Policy on that specified page.<br>

                  As part of offering and providing customizable and
                  personalized services, Freeze.com uses cookies to store and
                  sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small
                  amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server
                  and stored on your computer's hard drive. Any of the
                  Freeze.com family of sites, including Screen-Savers.com, which
                  ask you to log-in or that are customizable require that you
                  accept cookies. (See "What are my choices regarding

                  more information on cookies.)<br>

                  Generally, we use cookies to:</b><br>
                  <br>
                  (1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account
                  information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to
                  you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set
                  when you register or "Sign In" and is modified when
                  you "Sign Out" of our services. Freeze.com also uses
                  cookies to store your zip code for other services, such as
                  Yellow Pages.<br>
                  <br>
                  (2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing
                  Freeze.com is given a unique cookie which is then used to
                  determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered
                  user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target
                  advertisements based on user interests and behavior.<br>
                  <br>
                  (3) Assist affiliates and merchants associated with Freeze.com
                  to track visits to and business at their sites and stores, and
                  to process the items in your shopping basket. This information
                  collected by cookies is sometimes called "clickstream"
                  or "click trail" and may also describe which pages
                  you have seen in each merchant's store.<br>
                  <br>
                  (4) Track your progress and number of entries in some of our
                  promotions, downloads, sweepstakes and contests. When a
                  Freeze.com-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information
                  written to the cookie indicates the player's progress through
                  the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions,
                  and status in prize drawings.<br>
                  <br>
                  (5) Measure certain traffic patterns, for example areas of
                  Freeze.com's network of web sites you have visited, and your
                  visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to
                  understand how our users' habits are similar or different from
                  one another so that we can make each new experience on
                  Freeze.com a better one. We may use this information to better
                  personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and

                  Freeze.com also collects IP addresses for system
                  administration and to report aggregate information to our

                  <br>
                  Freeze.com's primary goal in collecting personal information
                  is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on
                  our network of sites and through our partners. This includes
                  personalization services, interactive communications, online
                  shopping and many other types of services, most of which are
                  completely free to you. In order to provide services free of
                  charge, we display advertisements and encourage your
                  participation in opt-in mailings. By knowing a little about
                  you, Freeze.com is able to deliver more relevant
                  advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.<br>
                  <br>
                  In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, Freeze.com
                  plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and
                  tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example,
                  males over 35 years old). Freeze.com takes the advertisement
                  and displays it to users meeting that criteria. In this
                  process, the advertiser never has access to individual account
                  information. Only Freeze.com has access to individuals'
                  accounts. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with
                  banner ads as well as promotional email through Freeze.com.
                  You will only receive special offers via email from Freeze.com
                  if you have indicated in your account preferences, or at some
                  other time, that you would like to receive them. You can
                  change your account preferences or notify the sender of e-mail
                  to unsubscribe you at any time.<br>
                  <br>
                  Freeze.com does research on our users' demographics,
                  interests, and behavior based on the information provided to
                  us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log
                  files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and
                  serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an
                  aggregated basis. Freeze.com may share this aggregated data
                  with advertisers or business partners.<br>

                  <br>
                  When you are on a Freeze.com site and are asked for personal
                  information, you are sharing that information with Freeze.com
                  alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. For
                  example, some Freeze.com services, like contests and games,
                  are offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order to
                  provide this co-branded service to you, it is necessary for us
                  to share your personal information with our partner company.
                  If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company
                  other than Freeze.com, you will be notified prior to the time
                  of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your
                  data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by
                  not using that particular service.<br>

                  As a general rule, Freeze.com will not disclose any of your
                  personally identifiable information except when you have
                  decided to opt-in to receive information, we have your

                  believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the
                  circumstances described below. The following describes some of
                  the ways that your information may be disclosed.<br>
                  <br>
                  Business Partners &amp; Sponsors: Freeze.com may disclose your
                  personal information to business partners or sponsors, but
                  this is specifically described to you prior to data collection
                  or prior to transferring the data. Some or all data collected
                  during a Freeze.com promotion may be shared with a sponsor. If
                  personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will
                  tell you before we collect or transfer the data.<br>
                  <br>
                  Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional
                  information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you
                  give Freeze.com permission to transfer your personal
                  information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request.
                  In many instances, only your email address will be shared, in
                  other cases, more demographic information may be shared.<br>
                  <br>
                  Freeze.com Shopping: If you make a purchase from a store
                  hosted by Freeze.com, or a merchant associated with
                  Freeze.com, the information obtained during your visit to
                  those stores, and the information you give such as your credit
                  card number and contact information, is provided to the
                  merchants. This is to enable transactions to take place.<br>
                  <br>
                  Merchants associated with Freeze.com have separate privacy and
                  data collection practices. Freeze.com has no responsibility or

                  From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to
                  receive materials or special offers from third parties. If you
                  opt-in to receive information from these third parties,

                  information with third party data. Also, Freeze.com discloses

                  What about children's privacy?</b><br>
                  <br>
                  The safety of children is very important to us.
                  Freeze.com is a family of general audience web sites that
                  comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. When
                  a child under age 13 attempts to register with Freeze.com, we
                  ask that they have a parent or guardian establish a Freeze.com
                  Family Account. This is to ensure that the parent or guardian
                  consents to the collection and use of personally identifying
                  information from that child. Freeze.com Family Accounts allow
                  parents to review, edit and delete information relating to
                  their child's Freeze.com account. If a parent wishes to refuse
                  to permit further collection or use of their child's
                  information by Freeze.com, that parent can send an email to <a href="mailto:account-remove@Freeze.com">account-remove@Freeze.com</a>
                  to request deletion of their child's account.<br>
                  <br>
                  Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, no web
                  site operator is permitted to require a child under the age of
                  13 to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary
                  to participate in an activity as a condition of participation.
                  Freeze.com abides by this requirement.<br>
                  <br>
                  Freeze.com does not share personally identifying information
                  about users who are under the age of 13 with business partners
                  or other third parties. Freeze.com will not contact users who
                  are under the age of 13 about special offers or for marketing
                  purposes. All Freeze.com account holders, including parents
                  and children with Freeze.com Family Accounts, are subject to
                  this Privacy Policy.<br>

                  What else should I know about my privacy?</b><br>

                  Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose
                  personal information online - for example on message boards,
                  through email, or in chat areas - that information can be
                  collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal
                  information online that is accessible to the public, you may
                  receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.<br>
