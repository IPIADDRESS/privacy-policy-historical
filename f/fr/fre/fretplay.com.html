<font class="vanlig">
<b>Information Collection</b><br>
Sem Hadland AS is the sole owner of the information collected on Fretplay.com. Fretplay.com collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.
</font></p><p><font class="vanlig">
<b>Submitted tabs and chords</b><br>
These files are the author's own work and represents their interpretation of the song. You may only use this file for private study, scholarship, or research. 
</font></p><p><font class="vanlig">
<b>Profile</b><br>
We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users.  A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences.  Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user’s visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them.  We [do not] share your profile with other third parties.  [Your profile is shared in aggregate form only.] [Your profile is shared together with your personally identifiable information.]
</font></p><p><font class="vanlig">
<b>Cookies</b><br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user.  [Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.]  We use [both] session ID cookies [and] persistent cookies.  For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.  A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. 
</font></p><p><font class="vanlig">
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers).  However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising.  
</font></p><p><font class="vanlig">
 

Third Party Advertising
The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by Commission Junction, our Web advertising partner. Information about users’ visit to this site, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to users on this site. For more information about <a href="http://www.cj.com">Commission Junction</a>, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please <a href="http://www.cj.com/privacy.asp">click here</a>.
</font></p><p><font class="vanlig">
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by fretplay.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.  
</font></p><p><font class="vanlig">
<b>Log Files</b><br>
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files.  This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.  
</font></p><p><font class="vanlig">
<b>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</b><br>
We employ Commission Junction a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. 
</font></p><p><font class="vanlig">
Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same Web site or advertising company.  That means, for example, that if a person visited “www.companyX.com”, which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the Web site [or advertising company] would match the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information would then be given to the advertising company [or Web site].  
</font></p><p><font class="vanlig">
<b>Legal Disclaimer</b><br>
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.
</font></p><p><font class="vanlig">
 <b>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</b><br>
We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.
</font></p><p><font class="vanlig">
<b>Business Transitions</b><br>
In the event fretplay.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.  
</font></p><p><font class="vanlig">
Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties.  We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.
</font></p><p><font class="vanlig">
<b>Links</b><br>
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, fretplay.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 
</font></p><p><font class="vanlig">
<b> Surveys &amp; Contests</b><br>
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).  Contact information will be used [shared with the contest survey sponsors] to notify the winners and award prizes.  [Anonymous] Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.  Users’ personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users’ personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 
</font></p><p><font class="vanlig">
<b>Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums</b><br>
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
</font></p><p><font class="vanlig">
 <b>Security</b><br>
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.  When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.
