      <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Iselle
Enterprises strives
to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to
provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use
Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street
address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy.
We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any
unauthorized third party.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


      
      <p><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">How
we gather information from users<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>


      
      <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">How we
collect and store
information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in
which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example,
you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to
certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as
newsletters or when you make a purchase. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


      
      <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In
certain cases, you can
choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your
browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to
access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your
user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the
siteâ€™s features according to your preferences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


      
      <p><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">What
we do with the information we collect<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>


      
      <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Like
other Web publishers,
we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more
individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do
not share your information with anyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


      
      <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Aggregated
Information
(information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many
ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns
with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our
site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what
features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally
be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this
information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information
about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


      
      <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">We may
use Personally
Identifiable Information collected by Iselle Enterprises, and our
company web sites to communicate with you about your registration and
customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy;
services and products offered by Iselle Enterprises and other topics we
think you might find of interest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


      
      <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Personally
Identifiable
Information collected by Iselle Enterprises and our company web sites
may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site
administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,
administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications
with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the
operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access
such information. We will use your information only as permitted by
law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our
business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or
businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the
transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response
to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably
required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts
you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we
deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you
with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


      
      <p><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Affiliated
sites, linked sites and advertisements<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>


      
      <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Iselle
Enterprises and our
company web sites expect its partners, advertisers and affiliates to
respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third
parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other
content providers accessible through our site, may have their own
privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during
your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame of
content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also,
through our company web sites you may be introduced to, or be able to
access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes
offered by other parties. Iselle Enterprises is not responsible for the
actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the
applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing
information on a feature or page operated by a third party.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


      
      <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">While on
our site, our
advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use
cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your
preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our
advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that
enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular
advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer
services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other
technology to gather information. Iselle Enterprises does not control
the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting
information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such
third parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


      
      <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">You
should also be aware
that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on
message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed
publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our
knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals
or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Iselle
Enterprises and this policy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


      
      <p><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Children<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>


      
      <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Iselle
Enterprises does not
knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from
or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover
we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of
this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you
believe Iselle Enterprises has any information from or about anyone
under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page
