			Privacy Policy</font></p>
			<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">This privacy statement 
			is created in order to demonstrate our firm and continuing 
			commitment to the privacy of personal information provided by those 
			visiting and interacting with this website. We hold the privacy of 
			your personal information in the highest regard. The following 
			discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for 
			this website.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">We recognize the 
			importance of protecting your privacy and our policy is designed to 
			assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard 
			personal information you provide us and to assist you in making 
			informed decisions while using our site. This policy will be 
			continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices 
			and our customers' needs.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">What Information Do We 
			Collect?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><br>
			When you visit this website you may provide us with two types of 
			information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose 
			that is collected on an individual basis and website use information 
			collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our 
			website.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">1. Personal 
			Information You Choose to Provide</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Registration 
			Information</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">When you register for 
			any of our products, services or newsletters you will provide us 
			information about yourself.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Credit Card 
			Information</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><br>
			If you choose to avail our services, you may need to give personal 
			information and authorization to obtain information from various 
			credit services. For example, you may need to provide the following 
			information to our reseller, Clickbank.com and their merchant 
			account. We do not store such data on our website, nor we have 
			access to it.<br>
			-Name<br>
			-Mailing address<br>
			-Email address<br>
			-Credit card number, name and billing address<br>
			-Business and home phone number</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Email Information</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><br>
			If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the 
			content of your email messages together with your email address and 
			our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic 
			communications that we employ in the maintenance of information 
			received by mail and telephone.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">2. Website Use 
			Information</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><br>
			Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilizes a 
			standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What 
			Are Cookies?") and web server log files to collect information about 
			how our website is used. Information gathered through cookies and 
			Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages 
			viewed, time spent at our website, and the websites visited just 
			before and just after our website.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">How Do We Use the 
			Information That You Provide to Us?</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Broadly speaking, we 
			use personal information for purposes of administering our business 
			activities, providing the products and services you requested, to 
			process your payment, to monitor the use of the service, our 
			marketing and promotional efforts and improve our content and 
			service offerings, and customize our site's content, layout, 
			services and for other lawful purposes. These uses improve our site 
			and better tailor it to meet your needs.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Furthermore, such 
			information may be shared with others on an aggregate basis. 
			Personally identifiable information or business information will not 
			be shared with parties except as required by law. Occasionally, we 
			may also use the information we collect to notify you about 
			important changes to our website, new services, and special offers 
			we think you will find valuable. You may notify us at any time if 
			you do not wish to receive these offers by emailing us at the link 
			provided on the newsletter.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">What Are Cookies?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><br>
			A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an 
			anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site's 
			computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a 
			part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each 
			website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's 
			preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser 
			only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to 
			you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are 
			usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to 
			receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to 
			refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, 
			it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as 
			effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie cannot retrieve any 
			other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">How Do We Use 
			Information We Collect from Cookies?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><br>
			As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to 
			differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use 
			cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary 
			for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log 
			files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting 
			our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This 
			helps us gather feedback to constantly improve our Web site and 
			better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any 
			personal information about you and we do not intentionally store any 
			personal information that your browser provided to us in your 
			cookies.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">IP Addresses</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><br>
			IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected 
			to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by 
			computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are 
			automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and 
			profile data known as “traffic data” so that data (such as the Web 
			pages you request) can be sent to you.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Sharing and Selling 
			Information</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><br>
			We do not share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that 
			uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal 
			details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process 
			transactions or provide services that you have requested.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">How Can You Access and 
			Correct Your Information?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><br>
			You may request access to all your personally identifiable 
			information that we collect online and maintain in our database by 
			emailing us at the usual address.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">What About Legally 
			Compelled Disclosure of Information?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><br>
			We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in 
			other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires 
			it or for the protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose 
			account information when we have reason to believe that disclosing 
			this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal 
			action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or 
			to protect the safety of our users and the Public.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">What About Other 
			Websites Linked to Our Website?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><br>
			We are not responsible for the practices employed by Websites linked 
			to or from our Website or the information or content contained 
			therein. Often links to other Websites are provided solely as 
			pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of 
			our Website.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Please remember that 
			when you use a link to go from our Website to another website, our 
			Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction 
			on any other website, including websites, which have a link on our 
			Website, is subject to that Website's own rules and policies. Please 
			read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Your Consent</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><br>
			By using our Website you consent to our collection and use of your 
			personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve 
			the right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or without 
			notice.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Our Commitment To Data 
			Security</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Please note that your 
			information will be stored and processed on our computers in the 
			United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United 
			States may be less stringent than the laws of your Country of 
			residence or citizenship. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain 
			data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have 
			put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial 
			procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect 
			online.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><br>
			This site allows visitors to unsubscribe so that they will not 
			receive future messages. After unsubscribing we will discontinue 
			sending the particular messages as soon as technically feasible.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">A Special Note About 
			Children</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Children are not 
			eligible to use our services unsupervised and we ask that children 
			(under the age of 16) do not submit any personal information to us. 
			If you are a minor, you can use this service only in conjunction 
			with permission and guidance from your parents or guardians.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Acquisition or Changes 
			in Ownership</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">In the event that the 
			website (or a substantial portion of its assets) is acquired, your 
			information would be considered part of those assets, and may be 
			part of those assets that are transferred.</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Privacy Policy 
			Modifications</font></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">We may change this 
			Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes are made to this 
			privacy policy, we will email users who have given us permission to 
			do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back 
			periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy 
			changes in the future, we will not use the personal information you 
			have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is 
			materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior 
			consent.</font><br>
