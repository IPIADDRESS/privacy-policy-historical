CPX Interactive understands that your online privacy is important to you. We have created the following Privacy and Data Use Policy (the “Policy”) to let you know what information we collect on this Web site and when we serve advertisements on our network of Web sites owned by third-party publishers (collectively, the "CPX Interactive Site Network"), how such information is used, and how it is shared with third parties if shared at all. </span></p>
<p class="bold"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Please read this Policy carefully. Use of the CPX Interactive Site Network, this Web site and your sharing of information with us is subject to the terms and conditions of this Policy. By using the CPX Interactive Site Network, this Web site or sharing information with us, you give your agreement to this Policy. The Policy may be revised or updated at any time by us as further described below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #333333;">The terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer to the Web site visitor or consumer. The terms "CPX Interactive," "we," "us," and "our" refer to CPX Interactive, and the companies under its control (such as subsidiaries), or under common control (such as parent companies, or companies owned by its parent company) (collectively, “CPX Interactive Entities”).</span></p>

To do so, we collect information about the type of browser and operating system of Web site visitors, as well as the domain name, day and time of visit, and page(s) visited. We do so across multiple Web domains owned or operated by different entities (each, a "Site").</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #333333;"><br></span></p>

Delivering more relevant advertising to you and other Web site visitors allows Web site owners to generate more advertising revenue. This revenue pays for the free content that they may publish for you, or free services that they may deliver to you. It also means that you are more likely to see online advertising that meets your interests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #333333;">In an effort to deliver relevant advertising to you, we collect data across multiple Web domains owned or operated by different entities to categorize likely consumer interest segments for use in advertising online ("Online Behavioral Advertising" or "OBA"). For example, we can analyze aggregate, anonymous data to determine that a visitor of a particular Site at 6:30PM is more likely to be interested in Pizza, or antique cars, or a classic movie. We can then serve an ad to the Web page the visitor is viewing that offers a discounted Pizza, car show tickets, or classic movie DVD—importantly—without ever knowing the identity or personal information of the visitor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #333333;">If you do not wish to benefit from relevant advertising, please feel free opt out OBA as described in the paragraph titled “OBA Opt-Out”, below.</span></p>
