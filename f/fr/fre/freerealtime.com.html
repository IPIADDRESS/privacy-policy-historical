<h2><u>FreeRealTime.com Privacy Policy</u></h2>


FreeRealTime.com respects your privacy.  This statement of our Privacy
Policy explains what information we gather from you and how we use that
information.  We consider the information you have shared with us strictly
confidential and will use that information only as specified in this Privacy
Policy or to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law.

<h2>Information We Gather and How We Use It</h2>

We collect certain information from you in order to provide you with the
most interesting and useful Web site possible.
<p>
We use your IP address to identify you, to gather demographic information
that helps us understand how you and our other customers use our Web site,
and to administer our Web site. If you purchase items through the
MarketPlace, your IP address is used to help match you with your shopping
cart.
</p><p>
Our registration form requires you to give us contact information (like your
name and email address), demographic information (like your zip code, age,
occupation and income level) and profile information (like your investment
experience). We use your contact information to contact you about our Web
site and provide you with information and promotional material from our
partners and advertisers.  We use various other portions of your information
to comply with New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market regulations
regarding the distribution of real-time information, to target advertising,
and to personalize our Web site by showing you content that we think you
might be interested in and displaying the content according to your
preferences. 
</p><p>
We sometimes conduct or sponsor surveys and contests on our Web site.  If
you elect to participate, we may ask you for contact, demographic and other
information as part of these offerings.  We would use this information to
analyze and report on the results of surveys, to provide you with the
results of the surveys and contests, and to send you information about our
company and promotional material from our partners and advertisers. 
Participation in surveys and contests is completely voluntary.
</p><p>
From time to time we may supplement information that you provide to us with
information received from third parties.

</p><h2>Information We May Disclose</h2>

We do not sell, trade or rent your personal contact information to anyone.
<p>
We share demographic, profile and other general information about you and
our other customers with our advertisers on an aggregate basis.  This means
that we tell our advertisers general information about the characteristics
of our customer base such as how many female visitors and registered users
we have within a certain postal code, but we do not specifically identify a
particular female visitor or provide her contact information to our
advertisers.
</p><p>
Our advertisers may ask us to mail or e-mail you promotional information
tailored to your interests.  We will send you this information on behalf of
our advertisers.  Our advertisers will not be given your contact
information.  From time to time we may use third parties (pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement) to assist us in e-mail broadcasts and list
management.  You may opt-out of receiving these mailings as explained below
under the heading “Your Options.”
</p><p>
We may disclose your contact information or other specific information about
you to third parties in conjunction with contests or new service offerings
that you elect to participate in, but we will specifically describe with
whom we will be sharing the information at the time we gather the
information.    
</p><p>
We may share your contact information with our strategic partners and
certain other companies from whom you select to receive information.  You
must specifically opt to receive this information.  For example, if you are
interested in brokerages, and indicate that you would like to receive
information regarding brokerages, we will provide our brokerage partners and
other interested brokerages with information about your particular needs. 
These selected entities may send you information by e-mail or regular mail,
or may contact you by telephone.
</p><p>
We may release your contact and other information to third parties when we
believe that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law,
(ii) cooperate with state and federal regulatory agency investigations,
(iii) comply with the terms of the Subscriber Agreements with Nasdaq and the
New York Stock Exchange, (iv) enforce the terms of our User Agreement or
License Agreement, or (v) protect the rights of FreeRealTime.com or others.
