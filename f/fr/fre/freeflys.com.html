<p><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>

<p>
This policy discloses the privacy practices for Schoolster, Inc. By visiting Schoolster, Inc, you are accepting the practices described herein. Because Schoolster, Inc. wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and notify you of the following:</p>

<p>What information do we collect?</p>

<p>The information we collect helps us ensure that our services are best designed to meet your needs. We receive and store any information that you enter on any registration page. Typically these will be registration forms for contests, surveys or other promotions. If you are giving us information in order to participate in a survey, contest or other promotion, your participation is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. If some information is required and some is optional, we will identify the required information. We collect both contact and other information.</p>

<p>A. Contact Information</p>

<p>Contact information consists of the information that we can use to contact you if, for example, you win one of the contests or promotions sponsored by Schoolster, Inc. and/or its affiliates and partners. This consists of your name, your e-mail address, IP address and possibly your mailing address, telephone and facsimile number.</p>

<p>B. Other Information</p>

<p>Profile data also is collected at our site. Depending on the specific Schoolster, Inc. products for which a user ("User") registers, various information will be requested. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience through our interest-focused e-mails. By obtaining this information, we can provide our Users with specific content that we think they might be interested in, according to their preferences and interests. None of this information is required in order to receive the Schoolster, Inc. service. The User may include only the information he or she feels comfortable including. However, the omission of certain information may limit the value of the experience for the User. As a result, the more information we have about a User, the more valuable the Schoolster, Inc. experience will be for that User.</p>

<p>C. Under thirteen (13)</p>

<p>Schoolster, Inc. does not intentionally collect the personal information of children under the age of thirteen (13).</p>

<p>How is User information used?</p>

<p>A. Information that you provide</p>

<p>Schoolster, Inc. does not send unsolicited or "spam" e-mail. We use User information in a number of ways, including:</p>

<p>1) to send personalized, targeted information to the User in the form of e-mail messages and/or direct mail;
2) to send targeted advertising that allows us to provide our service at no or little cost to the Users;
3) to send promotions and coupons based on their interests;
4) to contact Users for feedback and surveys;
5) to monitor and improve its internal operations, as well as to ensure that it properly performs the services requested and bills properly where appropriate; and
6) to send Users other information about Schoolster, Inc. and/or its products.</p>

<p>When you register with Schoolster, Inc., you may receive offers from us or our marketing partners. Our marketing partners may use this information to make offers to you in your areas of interest or other offers. It is solely at your discretion if you choose to provide additional personally identifiable information to a marketer by making a purchase, requesting additional information, or communicating directly with the company or organization after using its website. We may also use outside companies to execute the marketing campaigns on our behalf or on behalf of some of our marketing partners. We will share your e-mail name or other contact information that is necessary for these third parties to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purposes of providing these services.</p>

<p>B. Automatic Information ("Cookies")</p>

<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the User's hard drive containing information about the User. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on Schoolster.com For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the User would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a User rejects the cookie, he or she may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the User will be limited in some areas of the Schoolster, Inc. Site. For example, the User may not be able to participate in selected Sweepstakes, Contests or monthly Drawings that take place. Cookies also can enable us to track and target the interests of our Users to enhance their experience on the Schoolster, Inc. Site.</p>

<p>You can set your browser to not accept cookies. Please be aware that by doing so certain features of the Schoolster, Inc. Site may not work. See your browser's documentation for more information on accepting cookies.</p>

<p>Schoolster, Inc. uses cookies to collect and store certain types of information when you interact with us in order to (i) access your account information (stored on our computers) and keep track of your points or credits; and (ii) learn what you like and, hence, to provide a more personalized experience for you. In the future, Schoolster, Inc. may use cookies to enable us or a merchant to track visits to and business at its store and process the items in your shopping basket. Schoolster, Inc. strongly encourages all of its merchants to post their privacy policies on their sites and to adhere to the same high standards as stated herein.</p>

<p>C. Log Files</p>

<p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track User's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. While we collect standard Apache log files, we do not use them for any purpose other than determining page views. We also collect pages visited within our database through cookies (as discussed above). This data is connected with registration information so we can determine site usage and for marketing research. Except in the case of domain name registrations, IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>Does Schoolster, Inc. share information it collects?</p>

<p>A. Registration Information</p>

<p>As part of the registration process, we often offer you the option to take advantage of one or more offers from our partners. Those offers are optional and you do not have to sign-up for any offers in order to participate in the main promotional offer (although you may need to check or uncheck certain boxes to do so). If you do choose to sign-up for an offer, we will share information about you with those selected partners from whom you have chosen to receive information. All offers have Terms and Conditions links that we encourage you to read.</p>

<p>When you register with Schoolster, Inc, you can elect to sign up with some of our marketing partners so they may to contact you with their special offers. Our marketing partners wishing to contact you either give their e-mail message to us and we deliver it to you, or with your prior permission, we provide your contact information to them so they can deliver messages directly to you. It is solely at your discretion if you choose to provide additional personally identifiable information to a marketer by making a purchase, requesting additional information, or communicating directly with the company or organization after using its website. We may share this information with a third-party advertising company in order to market more effectively to you.</p>

<p>We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf (e.g., outsourced e-mail delivery companies). They have access to the User information to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</p>

<p>B. Referral Program</p>

<p>As part of some of our referral programs, we request contact information (like the name and e-mail address) of visitors' friends and family whom they think would like to receive a Schoolster, Inc. service. The persons referred to us will receive sample Schoolster, Inc. e-mails, but do not become subscribers until they confirm their interest in the service. Schoolster, Inc. stores this information for the sole purpose of sending the emails regarding Schoolster, Inc. services. The person referred also can unsubscribe at any time; see "What Choices Do I Have," below.</p>

<p>C. Links To Other Sites</p>

<p>This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. Except as otherwise stated in this policy, it is against our policy to provide any customer information to third parties without the customer's prior permission. As part of our business, however, we also provide links to third party sites. We encourage all of our merchants to post their privacy policies on their sites and to adhere to the same high standard as is stated here. We, however, disclaim any responsibility for the actions of these third parties. AS A RESULT, WE ENCOURAGE OUR USERS TO READ THE PRIVACY POLICIES OF THESE LINKED SITES, BECAUSE THEIR PRIVACY POLICIES MAY DIFFER FROM OURS.</p>

<p>D. Protection of Schoolster, Inc. and Others</p>

<p>We may release User or account information as is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Schoolster, Inc., its subsidiaries, affiliates or partners, our Users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.</p>

<p>What Choices do I have?</p>

<p>A. Choices In Disclosing Information</p>

<p>Because we want our Users to feel completely comfortable using the Schoolster, Inc. services, we provide you with various opportunities to control how the information you provide to us will be used by us. We request information from our customers' registration, as well as via surveys or contests or other promotions. Your participation in these activities is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Nevertheless, certain basic information is required in order to register as a User. Information requested may include contact information, and demographic information. You also may choose whether or not to get e-mails from Schoolster, Inc. and whether or not to accept special offers from our partners. If you choose not to receive e-mail from Schoolster, Inc. we will not send you e-mail, although it may take a short time to remove your name from our database.</p>

<p>Please note once an account is created, we may send you a confirmation e-mail acknowledging your new account to the address that you supplied us. This e-mail will give you the option to delete your account, in case you change your mind or in case you were not the one who created it in the first place. You should keep the confirmation e-mail, as it will also contain information that will help you in case you run into problems accessing our services.</p>

<p>B. Opting Out</p>

<p>To remove your User information from our mailing list(s) so as not to receive future communications from us or to no longer receive our service, please send an email to webmaster@Schoolster.com.

<p>How secure is my information?</p>

<p>While we strive to protect your personal information, Schoolster, Inc. cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. In addition, Schoolster, Inc. and third party Internet sites and services accessible through Schoolster, Inc. or parties whom we inform you are collecting data in connection with contests, games, promotions, etc., have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of us. Schoolster, Inc. has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.</p>
