        <p class="terms-text">This Privacy Policy describes the policies of Eighty Percent Solutions Corporation regarding the information we collect or receive about our customers. It is applicable to the main Eighty Percent Solutions (http://80pct.com), Freedom Software (http://macfreedom.com, http://freedomapp.us, http://freedomforandroid.com, http://freedom.to), and Anti-Social (http://anti-social.cc) websites, as well as other interactive features, applications, services, or downloads that are operated by Eighty Percent Solutions Corporation and which are available through the websites produced and maintained by us ("site/s").
        </p>
        <p class="terms-text">We have established this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to let you know the kinds of personal information we may gather, why we gather your information, what we use your personal information for, when we might disclose your personal information, and how you can manage your personal information. For questions or concerns, we can always be contacted via email at support@80pct.com or via phone at +1-415-968-9172 (full contact information, including mailing address, is at the end of this policy).
        </p>
        <h6>Information Ownership, Collection and Use</h6>
        <p class="terms-text">One of the basic principles we’ve tried to follow in designing this site is that we ask for only the information we need to provide the service you’ve requested. As a result, what information we collect and store depends almost entirely on how you choose to make use of our site and our services. You retain ownership of information you personally author and collected through the sites (the "user content"); provided. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from those disclosed in this policy. We may collect information from users at several different points on a site.
        </p>
        <p class="terms-text">This privacy policy addresses some types of information, means of collecting information, and uses of information that may not presently apply to one or more of the sites. We tell you about these types of information, means of collecting information, and uses of information anyway because we want to maintain flexibility in offering additional features without having to revisit our terms and conditions or privacy policy every time we revise a site or offer new functions. 
        </p>
        <h6>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) Compliance and Related Information</h6>
        <p class="terms-text">The Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (COPPA) regulates online collection of information from persons under the age of 13. It is our policy to refrain from knowingly collecting or maintaining personally identifiable information relating to any person under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not supply any personally identifiable information through the site. If you are under the age of 18 and have already provided personally identifiable information through the site, please have your parent or guardian contact us immediately using the contact information herein so that we can remove such information from our files.
        </p>

When we already have information about you (such as through a previous order, previous use, previous registration, or previous contact, whether received through a site or otherwise), we may use such information to facilitate the order, registration or other process. When using an order form, you must provide contact information (such as name and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your order. If we have trouble processing an order, we use this contact information to contact you.
