            <p>              Registration  information submitted on one of FGS's own sites is used by that site for the  purpose for which it was submitted and may also be used by FGS's other sites in  order to make your visits to our own sites more easy and enjoyable.<br>
              Personal  information may be used in several ways:
            </p>
            <ul type="disc">
            <li>To       enable us to respond to you or to process, validate and verify service       requests and to perform the requested services. </li>
		    <li>To allow       us to charge and invoice you and to contact you regarding changes to the       subscribed services. </li>

		    <li>To give       our own Web site designers information that's useful for developing new       features and services that meet registrants' needs. </li>
		    <li>To allow       us to potentially vary the advertising that registrants see based on their       volunteered preferences. </li>
		    <li>To       tailor the registrant's experience on our sties, showing them content we       think might interest them or altering the content according to their preferences. </li>
	      </ul>

		    Information  submitted to us at freegaysex.com as part of online applications for employment  or for partner candidates is used by us to evaluate your qualifications for the  positions sought.<br>
		    We  do not merge, associate or link any registration information you submit to us  at our sites with any of the navigational or interest information we gather  anonymously on our sites. <br>
		    In  case you change your mind about personal information you have given us or if  some of it has changed, we will endeavor to provide a way to review, correct,  update or remove personal information you have given us.<br>
		    If  you elect to use our referral service to inform a friend about our site(s), you  can submit your friend's e-mail address.&nbsp; We will automatically send the  friend a one-time e-mail inviting him or her to visit our site.&nbsp; We will  use your friend's e-mail for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail.  &nbsp; The friend may also contact us at <img src="images/e.jpg" width="160" height="11" alt=""> to request that we delete the information.</p>

		  <p>		    Our  sites may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available  to its users.&nbsp; Please remember that any information that is disclosed in  these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when  deciding to disclose your personal information to people you do not know.&nbsp;  If you disclose your e-mail address in a chat room or forum, you may receive  unsolicited e-mails or “spam”.&nbsp; We cannot safeguard the privacy of any  such information you choose to disclose online in this manner and you must do  so carefully and at your own risk.</p>

		  <p>            Except  as may be stated expressly in this Privacy Policy, FGS does not share personal  information with third parties.</p>
		  <h2>Legal Disclosures</h2>
		  <p>		    There  are a limited number of situations where we may disclose your personal  information to others without first receiving your consent: &nbsp; (1) when  legally ordered to do so by a lawful subpoena or court order, (2) if you  violate or breach an agreement with us, (3) if we believe conduct by you will  harm the property or rights of FGS or those of our affiliate program members, (4) under exigent circumstances to protect the  physical safety of FGS, its employees, users or the general public, (5) in  connection with the sale of all or substantially all of our company's assets or  the sale of an entire Web site or business division or (6) in order to validate  credit card numbers for charging for fee services.</p>

		  <p>		    FGS  may share aggregate statistical information gathered from the registration  process with advertisers, business partners, sponsor or other third parties, but  none of them receive individual identifying information about you collected at  our sties.&nbsp; For example, we may tell an advertiser that Z number of  visitors visited a certain area on a Web site or that Y number of men and Z  number of women filled out registration forms, but we would not disclose  anything that would identify those individuals. &nbsp; We share this  information only on an aggregate, anonymous basis and never on an individual  basis. &nbsp;</p>
		  <h2>Anonymous Info</h2>
		  <h3>Our Cookies</h3>
		  <p>		    Your  browser offers so-called “cookies”, which – if you allow their use – store  small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of our  sites.&nbsp; Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like  best.&nbsp; And when you re-visit our sties, cookies can enable us to customize  our content according to your preferences.&nbsp; However, cookies tell us  nothing about you personally unless you specifically give us additional  information.<br>
            We  may use cookies to:</p>
		  <ul type="disc">
            <li>Keep       count of your return visits to our site or our clients' sites. </li>
		    <li>Accumulate       and report anonymous, aggregate, statistical information on Web site       usage. </li>
		    <li>Deliver       content specific to your interests. </li>
		    <li>Save       your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our       sites. </li>
	      </ul>
		  <p>We  do not use cookies to identify, monitor or track any personally identifiable  information.&nbsp; Our cookies in and of themselves do not contain any  personally identifiable information about you.&nbsp; We do not merge or  associate our cookie information with any personally identifiable information  obtained by us or from third parties.<br>
		    You  also have choices with respect to cookies.&nbsp; By modifying your browser  preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a  cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. &nbsp;&nbsp; However, note that if you  reject some or all cookies, your experience at our sites and on other sites  throughout the World Wide Web may not be complete. &nbsp; Some sites require  cookies to function, such as those with e-commerce features.&nbsp; In addition,  if you do not allow cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of  personalized content delivery offered by us or other Internet sites.</p>
		  <h3>Third Party Cookies At Our Site</h3>
		  <p>Some  of the banner ads displayed on our sites are provide by outside companies.&nbsp;  These ads may contain cookies.&nbsp; The use of advertising cookies sent by  third party servers is standard in the Internet industry. &nbsp; While we use  cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are  placed by our advertisers. &nbsp; We do not have access to these cookies or any  information that they may contain; please contact the advertisers for more  information on these cookies</p>
		  <h3>IP Addresses</h3>
		  <p>		    An  IP address is a number assigned to your computer whenever you surf the  Web.&nbsp; IP addresses are not personally identifiable information and we have  never had the ability to determine your IP address.&nbsp; Internet Service  Providers (ISPs) usually randomly assign IP addresses at the time of dial-up.  &nbsp; For other local area network (LAN) or cable modem users, the ISP or  network may permanently assign a specific IP address to a particular computer  or other device connected to that network. &nbsp; Anytime you connect to a site  on the Internet, the computers communicating with each other exchange IP  addresses.&nbsp; IP addresses can reveal things like what part of the world  you're connecting from, or which Internet Service Provider you are using, but  they do not reveal who you are. </p>
		  <h2>Web Beacons</h2>
		  <p>		    Our  Web pages and the Web pages of our counter customers or members of our  affiliate program contain electronic images (called a “single-pixel gif” or  “Web beacon”) that allow us to count page views or to access our counter  cookies.&nbsp; In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page,  including an ad banner, can act as a Web beacon.&nbsp; Web beacons are  typically very small, banner like files, but their presence can be easily seen  within Internet Explorer by clicking on “View” and then on “Source”. &nbsp; Web  beacons are so small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen  that is better used to display helpful content.&nbsp; We also include Web  beacons in HTML- formatted newsletters containing graphics that we send to  opt-in subscribers in order to count how many newsletters have been read.  &nbsp; In addition, some advertising networks that serve ads on our Web sites  may use Web beacons within in their clearly visible banner  advertisements.&nbsp; Our Web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share  any personal information about our Web site visitors, they are just the technique  we use to compile our anonymous, aggregated statistics about Web site usage.</p>
		  <h2><strong>Computer Profiles</strong></h2>
		  <p>		    Through  our technology, we also collect and accumulate other anonymous data that helps  us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors.&nbsp; For  example, we accumulate visitor data relating to referring domains, the type of  browsers used, operating system software (e.g. Windows 95 vs. 98), screen  resolutions, color capabilities, plug-ins, language settings, cookie  preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement.&nbsp; We also  record number of visits, paths, taken and time spent on sites and pages.&nbsp;  None of this information is personally identifiable and we only share this  information in the aggregate, reflecting overall Web site or Internet usage  trends.</p>
		  <h2><strong>Security</strong></h2>
		  <p>		    Our  sites have physical, electronic and managerial security measures in place to  protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our  control.&nbsp; We take many measures to protect this information while it is  stored, including:</p>
		  <ul type="disc">
            <li>We use       Secure Socket layer (SSL) connections with 128- bit encryption for certain       transactions and confidential data.&nbsp; When you use a secure browser,       all information you submit to us is transmitted to us over the Internet in       an encrypted form. </li>
		    <li>We       monitor system and application activity logs to identify any unusual       activity, from authorized and/or unauthorized individuals accessing our       systems and/or making changes to stored information, for investigation.       &nbsp; We regularly perform preventative system maintenance and monitoring       to ensure the security of our data systems. </li>
		    <li>Our       servers are maintained in secured access, locked       facilities.&nbsp; NOC attendants monitors our data center 24 hours per       day, seven days per week. &nbsp; Backup tapes are retrieved daily and       stored.&nbsp; All our employees sign confidentiality agreements and only       our employees who need information to perform their job and who have       passed background checks are granted access to personally identifiable       information or any other confidential data. </li>
	      </ul>
		  <p>You  do not need to set up a user ID and password to use our Web sites because we do  not require you to establish your identity when you visit our sites. However,  if you have subscribed to some of our services  you will have to provide  passwords.&nbsp; We recommend you do not divulge your password to anyone.&nbsp;  FGS will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited telephone call or  e-mail.&nbsp; You are responsible for the secrecy of your passwords.<br>
		    Unfortunately,  no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be  guaranteed to be 100% secure. &nbsp; As a result, while we strive to protect  your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any  information you transmit, and you do so at your own risk.&nbsp; Once we receive  your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our  systems.&nbsp; You can report network abuse and any risk of security violations  to us by e-mail at the above address.</p>
		  <h2><strong>Children</strong></h2>
		  <p>		    Because  we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the  Children's Online Privacy Act of 1998 (COPA). &nbsp; COPA and its accompanying  FTC regulation established United States federal law that protects the privacy  of children using the Internet.&nbsp; FGS does not knowingly collect contact or  personal information from children under 13. &nbsp; Our sites are not intended  to solicit information of any kind from children under 13, and we have designed  our sites to block our knowing acceptance of information from children under 13  wherever age related information is requested.<br>
		    It  is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information given to us  or pertaining to children under 13. &nbsp; If we are notified of this, as soon  as we verify the information, we will immediately obtain parental consent or  otherwise delete the information from our servers. &nbsp; If you want to notify  us of our receipt of information by children under 13, please do so by  e-mailing us.</p>
		  <h2><strong>E-mails</strong></h2>
		  <p>            We  do not ordinarily maintain e-mails that have been sent to us after they have  been replied to, but if you would like to review, edit or delete any  information previously e-mailed to us that we might still have, send an e-mail  to us at the above address. &nbsp;&nbsp; It's  important that you include a copy of the previous e-mail, including its  original address line, to enable us to locate it.</p>
		  <h2><strong>Unsolicited E-mails <u>Received by You</u></strong></h2>
		  <p>		    FGS  does not send unsolicited e-mails to non-public addresses or to anyone who has  requested we do not contact them. &nbsp; Any newsletters that we send are only  sent to those who have taken affirmative steps to subscribe for them at one of  our Web sites. &nbsp; To stop receiving e-mails or newsletters from FGS, either  click on an unsubscribe link on the e-mail or newsletter itself or send a  request to be unsubscribed our email address above.
		    FGS  also does not condone Spam by our affiliates.&nbsp; Spam by our hosted customers  is prohibited by our Acceptable Use Policy which all affiliates accept on registration.&nbsp; Our Acceptable Use Policy  states, among other things, “Do not e-mail or otherwise transmit any  unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, “junk mail”,  “Spam”, “chain letters”, “pyramid schemes”, or any other form of solicitation”.  &nbsp; Further, according to our published policy, If FGS becomes aware that a  customer is in violation of the law or this Acceptable Use Policy, FGS reserves  the right to impose disciplinary action in its sole discretion.&nbsp; Our  disciplinary action may include: removal from our servers of files that violate  our Acceptable Use Policy, the expulsion of the customer from FGS Web sites,  termination of FGS services, and forfeiture of all commissions. &nbsp; </p>
		  <h2><strong>Cookies</strong></h2>
		  <p>		    If  you opt out of cookies, your Web site experience at our sites will not be  impaired.&nbsp; You may, however, be required to enter your user or account  information and passwords each time they are requested.&nbsp; You have several  options with respect to cookies:</p>
		  <ul type="disc">
            <li>By       modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all       cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. </li>
		    <li>For       instructions on how to do this, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">microsoft.com</a>, <a href="http://www.netscape.com">netscape.com</a>, etc. </li>
