        <h2>Details on what we do with your information.</h2>
        <p></p><h2>Freightquote.com, Inc. Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3>Policy Effective Date</h3>
<p>This policy is effective as of January 23, 2019 and replaces any and all previous versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Scope and Application of Policy</h3>
<p>Freightquote.com, Inc. and its parent company for and on behalf of its subsidiaries (collectively “Freightquote”) created this policy (the “Privacy Policy”) in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. The policy describes collection, use, storage, sharing and protection of your personal information for the Freightquote.com website and all related sites, applications, services and tools where this policy is referenced, regardless of how you access or use them, including mobile devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Consent</h3>
<p>By using the Freightquote.com website and its related sites, products, applications, services and tools, or registering for an account with Freightquote, you expressly consent to the collection, use, disclosure and retention of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. Further, you acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose your registration and any other information you provide if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary in our opinion to: (1) comply with legal process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders, other compulsory disclosures, or at the advice of legal counsel; (2) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties, whether or not the third party is a user, individual, or government agency; or (3) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Freightquote, our users or the public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout this Privacy Policy, we use the term “personal information” to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and could be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it can no longer be used, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify a specific person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users may check the Privacy Policy periodically to view any changes or updates. We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are initially posted on this site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Mobile Privacy</h3>
<p>We may offer you the ability to connect with our sites, or use our applications, services and tools using a mobile device, through a mobile optimized website or mobile application. The provisions of this policy apply to all such mobile access and use of mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>

Freightquote uses this information to create new accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Information Sharing and Registration with Social Media Websites</h3>
<p>Freightquote uses various social media sites to communicate about or advertise our business. We will not publish any personal data from our customers on these sites. We do not gain access to your email address or have any access to your personal data while you use social media sites to interact with Freightquote. Any request for personal information or shipment data to help us assist a shipper on these sites will be done through one-on-one messaging. While using social media sites, you are subject to the terms and conditions of these sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Use of Personal Information</h3>
<p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with access to our sites and/or use of our services, applications and tools, provide you with requested customer service and relevant information about your account and our services, and to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient and customized experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may use your personal information to provide access information to our services and tools; to perform general account servicing such as address verification and confirmation of shipments tendered; to collect your shipment information in order to process your shipment and generate an electronic pickup with a freight carrier and to forward shipping documents to the shipping or receiving parties; to customize your address book to simplify and speed up the shipment booking process and to allow Freightquote to contact a stored address if a shipment tendered cannot be delivered; to deliver notification of service updates and explanation of services; to customize, measure and improve our services, content and advertising; to deliver targeted marketing and promotional offers based on your communication preferences; to perform digital advertising, to contact you, either via email or telephone, to resolve disputes, collect fees and troubleshoot problems with your account or our sites, services, applications, or tools, or for other purposes as authorized by law; to provide you with other services requested by you as described when we collect the information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Marketing, Advertising and Pop-Ups</h3>
<p>Freightquote does not sell advertising anywhere on our website. If you see advertising pop up messages while using our website, they are not being served by Freightquote and are in no way endorsed or encouraged by Freightquote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Freightquote uses remarketing and retargeting to advertise online. When you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, email and other tools, we or our authorized service providers may use third party cookies (ex. Google) to show advertisements on websites across the Internet. Third party vendors, including, but not limited to, Google and social media sites, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to <a href="https://www.freightquote.com/" target="_self">Freightquote.com</a>. You may opt out third party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Some web browsers may transmit “do not track” signals to websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Freightquote does not currently take action in response to these signals.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Our Disclosure of Your Information</h3>
<p>We limit the disclosure of personal information to third parties to information required for shipment administration, including, but not limited to, shipping and receiving information, which we submit electronically to the freight carrier. </p>
<p>In certain situations, we may disclose your personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone’s rights, property, or safety. Such information will be disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws and regulations. We may also share your personal information with:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trade associations, whose access is restricted to the names and addresses of their own members or Agents, whose access is restricted to the account and shipment information for those users they have enrolled. Associations and Agents have no direct access to any Freightquote databases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third-parties, in connection with or in response to a criminal investigation, investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other alleged unlawful or illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other Freightquote user to legal liability. In such events, we will only disclose information relevant and necessary to the investigation or inquiry, such as name, street address, city, state, ZIP code, telephone number, email address, User ID history, IP address, fraud complaints, shipping addresses, transported commodity description and listing history, and anything else we may deem relevant to the investigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credit bureaus, with which we may report information about your account, including information on late payments, missed payments, or other defaults that may be reflected in your credit report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other business entities, should we plan to merge with, acquire or be acquired by that business entity. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may engage other companies to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, printing and mailing invoices, analyzing data and providing marketing analysis. Third parties performing these limited functions on our behalf shall have access to our user’s personal information as needed to perform these functions, but we do not permit them to use your personal information for other purposes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How We Protect and Store Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>We store and process your personal information on our computers in the United States.

Member access is restricted by the use of an email address and password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We take steps to ensure that the personal information we collect is accurate and up to date, and we provide you with the opportunity to update your information through your account profile settings. We retain information as long as it is necessary and relevant for our operations. In addition, we may retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, and take other actions as permitted by law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
