<p><strong>WHAT IS OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU?</strong><br>
				At ConsumerInfo.com, Inc. ("CIC") we are sensitive to your privacy concerns, and are committed to letting you know what information we collect about you, how the information is being used and what choices you have regarding the collection and use of the information. Please take a moment to review this privacy notice and feel free to contact us with any questions at <a href="mailto:privacy@consumerinfo.com">privacy@consumerinfo.com</a>. 
		  </p>
			
			<p><strong>WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</strong><br>
			We will collect and use personal information about you to respond to your request for products offered through our Sites. We will also collect information in order to notify you about products, services, and other opportunities we think will be of interest to you. The primary reason we collect personal credit information about you or your children is to provide products that you have requested and to enroll you into our membership products. The information we collect may be from the following sources: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Information provided by you when registering for a credit score, credit report or monitoring product offered through one of our Sites. For example, you will be required to submit personal information such as your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth to verify your identity prior to establishing your membership or providing you with your one-time transaction record. </li>
				
				<li>Information that you provide about your children when enrolling your children in our child identity monitoring products. For example, as a legal guardian, you will be required to submit the child's first and last name, Social Security number, and date of birth in order to register that child in identity monitoring with the credit bureau. </li>
				
				<li>Credit and debit card account information collected from you or your credit reports when enrolling in our card registry product.  For example, we will collect credit and debit card account information from you on our sites, over the phone, and from your credit reports from the three national credit reporting companies in order to cancel the cards per your request in the event that they are lost or stolen.  </li>
				
				<li>Billing information, such as a credit card number, is required to process the payment for the products you order from us. </li>
				
				
				<li>Other information we collect, such as city of birth and mother's maiden name, is used to verify your identity in the event you forget your login information required for our online products. </li>
				
				<li>Information you provide us when you receive communications from us. For example, we may request that you provide your e-mail address so that we may send you notifications, alerts, special offers and newsletters. </li>
				<li>Information you provide us when you apply for a job with CIC. </li>
				<li>Information you provide us through customer service correspondence and general feedback. </li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>We will also collect certain information arising out of your use of our Sites, or augment the data we collect with other information from other online or offline sources. We reserve the right to collect information about you and store it in connection with other online or offline information we may possess or obtain about you. </p>
			
			<p>Corrections or updates to your information including your email address, phone number, mailing address, credit card information or password reminder phrase can be made through the edit profile section of your account If necessary, other corrections or updates to your information (such as your name or Social Security number) can be made by contacting a customer care representative at 1-877-481-6826. For your protection, our customer care representatives may request supporting documents before making any changes or updates to your membership information.

		<p><strong>COOKIES AND WEB BUGS</strong><br>
		A cookie is a small piece of information that many Web sites use to help make shopping online easier.
