<h1>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h1>
<p>This site is owned and operated by Freewebs Corporation, 
the parent company of Freewebs.com. Your privacy on the Internet 
is of the utmost importance to us. At Freewebs.com, we want to 
make your experience online satisfying and safe.

</p><p>Because we gather certain types of information about our users, 
we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding 
the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement 
discloses what information we gather and how we use it.

</p><h2>Information gathered by Freewebs.com</h2>
<p>Freewebs.com gathers two types of information about users:

</p><ol>
 <li>Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. 
 These are voluntary submissions when creating a Freewebs account 
 such as your name or email address.
 </li><li>Information Freewebs.com gathers through aggregated tracking, derived mainly 
 by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better 
 tailor our content to users' needs and to help us better understand the demographics 
 of our audience. Under no circumstances does Freewebs.com divulge any information 
 about an individual user to a third party unless mandated by law.
</li></ol>

<p>Freewebs.com Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:
</p><dl>
 <dt>Optional Voluntary Information
 </dt><dd>We offer the following free services, which require some type 
 of voluntary submission of personal information by users:
 
 <ol>
  <li>Free Web Hosting<br>
  During the account creation process, the user is required to 
  supply their full name, username, password, and email address. 
  We will not disclose any information about any individual user 
  except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or 
  to protect the personal safety of our users or the public. Any 
  files uploaded or created on the Freewebs system are by nature 
  of being hosted, for the public and are thus publicly accessible 
  unless they are stored in the user's optional password-protected 
  directory. Files in a password protected directory will only be 
  accessible by means of a username and password which the user 
  will provide. We will not disclose any information about a user's 
  password protected directory username or password except to comply 
  with applicable law or valid legal process.
  </li><li>"E-mail this to a friend" Service<br>
  Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, 
  or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to 
  a friend". The user must provide their email address, as 
  well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in 
  the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient 
  know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.
  </li><li>Polling<br>
  We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share 
  their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks 
  about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are 
  aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. Freewebs.com 
  may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, 
  so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag 
  is not correlated with information about individual users.
  </li><li>Surveys<br>
  Freewebs.com may occasionally conduct optional user surveys to 
  better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share 
  the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our 
  sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this 
  information about specific individuals with any third party.
 </li></ol>

 </dd><dt>Children
 </dt><dd>Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection 
 Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally 
 identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without 
 requesting parental consent.
 </dd><dt>Usage tracking
 </dt><dd><p>Freewebs.com tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our 
 sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data 
 about individual users. Freewebs.com does break down overall usage 
 statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and 
 <abbr title="Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions">MIME</abbr>
 type by reading this information from the browser string 
 (information contained in every user's browser).
 </p><p>Freewebs.com sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that 
 users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never 
 associated with individual users. We use tracking information 
 to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like 
 based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual 
 users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This 
 helps us continue to build a better service for you.</p>
 </dd><dt>Cookies
 </dt><dd><p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser 
 files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal 
 Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this 
 site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. 
 But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information 
 you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk 
 or read cookie files created by other sites. Freewebs.com uses 
 cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our 
 advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track 
 ad impressions and click rates.
 </p><p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If 
 you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, 
 you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do 
 not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, 
 you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, 
 forums, polling and surveys.
