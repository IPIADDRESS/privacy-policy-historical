<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<b>FreeWildCoins is Powered by <a href="http://www.liftmediainc.com" target="_blank">Lift Media, Inc</a>.  </b>

<br><br>

<b>Web Users Privacy  </b>
<br>
Lift Media, Inc strongly believes in a consumer's right to privacy. All web user data collected by Lift Media, Inc as part of the ad serving process is not personally identifiable (browser type, for example) and is used in aggregate form.  

<br><br>

<b>What This Privacy Policy Covers</b>
<br>
This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Lift Media, Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies (collectively, "Lift Media, Inc's services"). In this Privacy Policy, references to "we," "our" and "us" refer to Lift Media, Inc while "you" and "your" refer to the Lift Media, Inc customer or user. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Lift Media, Inc does not own or control or to people that Lift Media, Inc does not employ or manage.

<br><br>

<b>Information Collection and Use</b>
<br>
As with all web content delivery systems, Lift Media, Inc records information about the interaction between a web user's browser and our servers. Those interactions include ad content (banner) delivery, counting click-throughs on an ad, and tracking webpage views after a click-through. Browsers typically provide the browser version, the operating system, and the IP address of the computer in use. This non-personally identifiable information is collected from web users to assist in the proper function of our service as well as the targeting of advertisements from our customers and the reporting of aggregate data to both advertisers and publishers. 

<br><br>

We may collect personal information when you register with Lift Media, Inc or when you use our products or services. We may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.   For many products and services we require address so that we can ensure delivery of physical products. 
Lift Media, Inc does not sell web user information that is personally identifiable. 

<br><br>

<b>Cookies: </b>
<br>
A cookie is a piece of data placed on the Web User's hard drive by our servers. Cookies are used to improve the experience web users have when they see web advertisements. We may set or access cookies to help improve your experience with our products or services.  Third party advertisers may set or access their cookies if you choose to visit their site.  Their usage of these cookies and their relationship with you is subject to their own privacy policy, not this one.

<br><br>

<b>Information Sharing:</b>
<br>
Lift Media, Inc does not rent, sell, or share personally identifiable information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission.   Lift Media will also share information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.   Similarly, we will use or share information to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Lift Media, Inc's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.   We will transfer information about you if Lift Media, Inc is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Lift Media, Inc will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.  We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Lift Media, Inc under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Lift Media, Inc communicate with you about offers from Lift Media, Inc and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share or sell this information with other parties. 

<br><br>

Web user information (all of which is non-personally identifiable) is shared with our advertisers and publishers in aggregate fashion. This means, for example, that of the millions of web users we deliver banners to each month, an advertiser will know what percentage of those users viewed their advertisement with a certain browser. The sharing of this information is essential to providing the services we offer. Lift Media, Inc may augment web user information with additional non-personally identifiable information, such as an IP address to 5-digit postal code cross reference to aid in local targeting of advertising. 

<br><br>

We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Lift Media, Inc service, such as service announcements and administrative messages that are considered part of your Lift Media, Inc account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them. 

<br><br>

We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. 

<br><br>
