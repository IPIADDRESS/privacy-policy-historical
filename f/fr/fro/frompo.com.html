                                To enhance user privacy, within 48 hours of your visit to our website; we will erase from our visit logs your entire IP address and the browser user

                                requires sharing a minimum amount of information to function as a search engine. But, we also permit you to crowd source your searches (solicit
                                input from others to enhance your web research). The 'social' element to Frompo requires us to use information in additional ways to provide the

                                not personally identifiable to you, in order to enhance your search results. For example, we may forward your search queries to one of our vendors
                                to check for misspellings (i.e., "Grand Canyo" may generate a did-you-mean reply of "Grand Canyon") or additional search terms that could provide
                                more relevant search results. We also might forward your search query to one of our vendors to acquire supplemental results.

                                        This feature disables display of all ads on Frompo.com. Also, Frompo will not send any information identifiable to you

                                        more difficult for other users to view your network activity on an unsecured wireles network.

                                        Frompo already has built-in controls to manage personally identifiable data, for example, we delete all IP Addresses within 48 hours of
