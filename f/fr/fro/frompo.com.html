                    	Frompo, Inc. respects your privacy and realizes that trust is the foundation of our relationship with you. This Privacy Policy describes
                        the information we collect about you, how it is used, and with whom we may or may not share it. We also offer you options regarding your
                        privacy choices more fully described below.

                    	This Privacy Policy only covers the Frompo website along with any and all related pages on Frompo.com. We are not responsible for the privacy
                        practices on any website other than Frompo.com. For example, we do not exercise control over the sites that appear as search results when you
                        use the Frompo website. When you leave the Frompo website, we encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies on all other websites that
                        you visit.

                    <p><b>INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</b></p>

                    <p>We collect different information from you depending upon how you use Frompo as described below.</p>
                    <p>
                    	When you use <b>Frompo</b>, we may collect the following information fields from you: IP Address, your browser user agent string (a user agent string
                        is the automatic information sent to us by your browser so we may properly format Frompo.com for your device and browser type), date and time of
                        your login, any third party websites that referred you to us and social media websites. When you search, we collect your search queries organized
                        into sessions that last up to four hours. If you select any websites from your search results, we will collect click tracking data, which is used
                        to compensate us when we drive traffic to other websites and to help us improve our search engine – we do not use this data for marketing purposes.
                        We may also need to verify your birth date to ensure that we are not collecting information in violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection
                        Act; we will discard your birth date once we have verified your age.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>HOW WE MINIMIZE DATA STORED ABOUT YOU</b></p>

                    <p>
                    	To enhance user privacy, within 48 hours of your visit to our website; we will erase from our visit logs your entire IP address and the browser user
                        agent string. However, our vendors may keep your IP Address, user agent string and isolated search strings from you for longer, but they are instructed
                        to keep this data secure.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>

                    <p>
                    	Search engines, by their very nature, must use information provided by you to deliver research results. Like other search engines, our website
                        requires sharing a minimum amount of information to function as a search engine. But, we also permit you to crowd source your searches (solicit
                        input from others to enhance your web research). The ‘social’ element to Frompo requires us to use information in additional ways to provide the
                        enhanced collaborative functionality. Below, we fully describe how we use
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    	information provided to us so that you can make the decision of whether or not to use our website and its enhanced functionalities.
                    </p>

                        not personally identifiable to you, in order to enhance your search results. For example, we may forward your search queries to one of our vendors
                        to check for misspellings (i.e., “Grand Canyo” may generate a did-you-mean reply of “Grand Canyon”) or additional search terms that could provide
                        more relevant search results. We also might forward your search query to one of our vendors to acquire supplemental results.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    	<a>Information Forwarded by Us to Provide Keyword Search Advertising:</a> Frompo provides its search services and web-based tools on the web to you
                        for free.We are able to sustain our free web-based content through advertising revenue. All of our advertising partners require that we send them your
                        IP Address, user agent string as well as search keywords in order to deliver search keyword advertising to you. If you do not want us to forward
                        your personal information for advertising purposes, you can opt-out of this sharing by selecting our “No Ads” preference, as described below. Further,
                        Frompo will forward your DoNotTrack browser settings, if you are using a browser that has DoNotTrack header functionality.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    	<a>To Improve Our Website:</a> Any of the information we collect, as described above, may be used for the following purposes: to improve our services
                        and products; to develop new services; to ensure and improve the technical functionality of our website and network; to protect your rights, Frompo’s

                    <p><b>YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES</b></p>

                    <p>Frompo's website offers you options to set preferences that enhance privacy:</p>

                    <ul>
                    	<li>No Facebook:<span> This feature disables all of Frompo’s integration with Facebook.</span></li>

                        	<span>
                            	This feature disables display of all ads on Frompo.com. Also, Frompo will not send any information identifiable to you

                        	<span>
                            	This feature helps make communications on Frompo.com more secure and private, for example making it more difficult for other users to

                            </span>

                            	This feature helps make links to search results on Frompo.com more secure. If you have this option selected, and if Frompo has
                            	determined that the link you are visiting has an https equivalent, Frompo will link to the https version of the website. This makes it
                            	more difficult for other users to view your network activity on an unsecured wireles network.

                                use. This setting goes one step further by helping you manage aggregate and/or anonymous information that may be disclosed regarding your
                                activities on Frompo.com. This setting prevents click tracking data from being collected by Frompo.com and ensures that no session
                                information is kept regarding your activities on Frompo.com. This setting also activates all of the above settings.
