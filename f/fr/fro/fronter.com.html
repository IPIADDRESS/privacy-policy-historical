<p><strong>ONLINE PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong></p>

<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY</p>

<p>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE POLICY OF THIS WEBSITE AND
COLLECTION, PROTECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF THE PERSONAL
INFORMATION GATHERED ON THIS SITE. IF YOU ARE UNDER 18 YEARS OF
AGE, PLEASE BE SURE TO READ THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT WITH YOUR
PARENTS OR GUARDIAN AND ASK THEM QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.</p>

<p>This website, fronter.com, com.fronter.info or
frontersupport.com (the "Site"), is owned and operated by Fronter
AS ("Fronter"). Fronter is a Pearson company and has aligned its
privacy statement with that of Pearson. Fronter recognises the
importance of explaining our privacy policies to users of our Site
and protecting the privacy of Personally Identifiable Information
we obtain through the site. Please note that this Privacy Statement
may be revised from time to time, particularly to address changes
in our business, the law or technology. If that happens, we will
post the revised policy here. Revisions are effective upon posting
and your continued use of this Site after the posting will be
subject to the changed terms of the revisions.</p>

<p>Fronter is the data controller, and you can contact Fronter by
writing to Fronter AS, Postboks 232 Sentrum, 0103 OSLO, Norway. You
have a right to access data we store about you and a right to
request that incorrect data is rectified.</p>

<p>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</p>

<p>Links from this site can take you to the sites of several
divisions of Pearson as well as to third party websites or
resources. The information practices of third party websites are
not covered by this Privacy Statement or any other policies or
terms of this Site. The sites of each of our divisions may also
have a different privacy policy and terms of use. Be sure that you
know the terms of use and privacy policy of any linked website
before using it.</p>

<p>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND USE</p>

<p>We consider the following to be examples of Personally
Identifiable Information but there may be others: your first and
last name, email address, phone number, and certain other
information if it is linked with your Personally Identifiable
Information.</p>

<p>Fronter does not collect Personally Identifiable Information
about a user, unless it is voluntarily provided to our Company and
so that we can serve the user's needs and our legitimate business
purposes as stated here. For example, when the user sends us a
message, submits a Tips&amp;Tricks article or an Admin forum
contribution, we need to retain certain Personally Identifiable
Information on this Site in order to respond. A user's Personally
Identifiable Information may also be used by our company to help us
improve this Site, and for our company's marketing and promotional
purposes. The information will be treated confidentially within our
company, as we protect other confidential information. You can
choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not
be able to take advantage of some of our features.</p>

<p>PUBLIC POSTINGS</p>

<p>Due to the nature of the Internet, users should be reminded that
any Personally Identifiable Information that is posted by a user to
a public area of the Site (for example in a Tips &amp;Tricks
posting or a comment) might be collected and used by others. We
cannot prevent such uses.</p>

<p>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</p>

<p>Except as specifically stated in this statement, our policy is
not to share the Personally Identifiable Information collected
through this Site with third parties, but we may share this
Personally Identifiable Information with affiliates of Pearson, and
other companies and organizations who perform work for us under
contract or sell products or services that complement our products
and services. We also may disclose Personally Identifiable
Information (a) in response to a subpoena, court order or legal
process, to the extent permitted and required by law; (b) to
protect user security or the security of other persons, consistent
with applicable laws; (c) in connection with a sale, joint venture
or other transfer to some or all of Pearson or the assets of
Pearson; or (d) in order to enforce the Site's Terms of Use, to the
extent permitted by law. We exercise commercially reasonable care
otherwise not to share, disclose or sell the Personally
Identifiable Information of users to third-parties, except with the
prior approval of the user.</p>

<p>Fronter may use a third party service to collect visitor
information like IP addresses, browser types (such as Internet
Explorer or Firefox), referring pages, pages visited and time spent
on a particular site. Fronter collects this information (1) for
statistical analysis of web page traffic patterns; (2) to
administer our Site and servers; and (3) for internal purposes to
make marketing decisions.</p>

<p>SPECIAL NOTICE TO PARENTS, TEACHERS AND CHILDREN</p>

<p>PARENTS AND TEACHERS: We encourage parents, guardians and
teachers to spend time with their Children (Children 12 and under)
when their Children engage in the on-line activities on this Site.
We will never request Personally Identifiable Information from a
Child in any of our public postings areas. We do not require a
Child to disclose more Personally Identifiable Information, than is
reasonably necessary to participate in the on-line activity. No
Personally Identifiable Information of children should be submitted
to or posted on this Site by Children without the consent of their
parent or guardian. We encourage parents to help us protect their
Children's privacy by instructing them never to provide Personally
Identifiable Information on this Site or any other website without
parental permission.</p>

<p>CHILDREN: Please do not give your full name, email address, home
address, telephone number or any other Personally Identifiable
Information that would enable someone to contact you either on-line
or off-line, without first asking your parent or guardian and
teacher for permission.</p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information
from Children on this Site either directly or passively except when
a Child may voluntarily submit such information through a "Wall of
Fame" post or a public posting area on the Site, if such feature is
available. If we have actual knowledge that a Child is sending or
posting Personally Identifiable Information on any area of this
Site, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such
Personally Identifiable Information before it is made public.
Please note that any online store that may be accessed from the
Site is intended for parents, teachers and other adult purchasers
over the age of 18 and requires the submission of Personally
Identifiable Information to fulfil and service any
transactions.</p>

<p>We may disclose a Child's Personally Identifiable Information if
we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is
necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against
someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either
intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other
users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We
may also disclose a Child's Personally Identifiable Information
when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>

<p>COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION FROM COOKIES</p>

<p>Our Site uses "cookies" to obtain certain types of information
when your Web browser accesses the Site. Cookies are textual
identifiers that our systems transfer to your computer's hard drive
through your Web browser to enable our Site to recognise your

Site. If you want to disable cookies, you can. The Help portion of
the toolbar on most browsers and "add-on" programs will tell you
how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have

disable cookies altogether. It is your choice, but cookies allow
you to take full advantage of this Site's features, and we
recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>

<p>We do not use cookies to get users' Personally Identifiable
Information before a user registers with our Site and affirmatively
opts-in. Once a user opts-in and provides personal information for
purposes of receiving more information from us, we do collect and
use that information obtained through the cookie technology for
purposes of marketing to you, in accordance with this policy. If
you do not want to receive e-mail or other marketing communications
from us, you can opt out of further marketing to the addresses you
have provided.</p>

<p>In connection with cookies we may use web beacons to track
response rates to certain email communications that a user has
opted to receive from us. If a user has registered with our Site,
we may collect certain personal information in connection with the
web beacon including the referring email address. This information
is not shared with third parties.</p>

<p>Fronter reserves the right to monitor your use of the site to
determine if you are complying with our terms and the right, in its
sole discretion, to terminate your access to the Site.</p>
