      <br>

        <h5>Use of Information</h5>
        <p>We use the information we collect and receive for the following general purposes:</p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

           <br>
        <p>If you do not want your information shared with any third party who may use such information for direct marketing purposes, then you <a name="Third"></a> may opt out of such disclosures by sending an email to us at privacy@frontrush.com.</p>   


      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

        <h5>Third-Party Functionality</h5>
        <p>Some of the functionality of the Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with Front Rush.  These entities may collect or receive certain information about your use of the Services, including through the use of cookies, Web beacons, and similar technologies. <a name="Protection"></a>Front Rush is not responsible for the privacy practices of these entities.</p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

        <h5>Protection of Information</h5>
        <p>We use reasonable physical and technical measures to safeguard information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification.  Please note, however, that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect the information we maintain, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us.  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Services, you are responsible for <a name="Children"></a>keeping this password confidential.  We ask that you not share your password with anyone.</p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

        <h5>Children’s Information</h5>
        <p>The Services are intended for a general audience and are not directed at children younger than 13.  We do not knowingly collect or store <a name="Non"></a>personal information about children under the age of 13 without parental consent, unless permitted by law.</p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

        <h5>Non-U.S. Users</h5>
        <p>The Services are intended for a U.S. audience.  If you access the Services from outside the United States, please be aware that information you provide to us or that we obtain as a result of your use of the Services may be processed and transferred to the United States and be subject to U.S. law.  The privacy and data protection laws in the United States may not be equivalent to such laws in your country of residence.  By using our website, participating in any of the Services, or by providing us with your information, you consent to the collection, <a name="Personal"></a>transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in the United States.</p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

        <h5>Changing or Deleting Your Personal Information</h5>
        <p>We wish to maintain accurate personal information.  If you have submitted personal information through our website and set-up an account, then you can (i) access and update your personal information by logging into your online account and making the appropriate changes or (ii) delete your account by email us at privacy@frontrush.com.  Please note that if you delete your account, we may continue to retain your information on our servers for archival purposes.  If you have forgotten your login credentials, you can retrieve those via our <a name="Targeted"></a>automated password retrieval system.</p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

        <h5>Targeted Advertising</h5>
        <p>In some cases, we and advertisers on the Services work with other third-party vendors to help deliver advertisements targeted to your interests.  These vendors include ad networks and analytics providers, and they use cookies or other technologies to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited) in order to help advertisers deliver particular ads that they believe you would find most relevant.  Many third-party vendors that perform these functions are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance, and you can opt out of those vendors’ delivery of targeted advertising to you by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Please note that, because these opt-out tools will place a cookie on your computer to record your opt-out preference, any actions you take using these tools will apply only to the web browser that you use to take the action.  Also, these tools may not work as expected if you set your browser to refuse cookies.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Sometimes, our advertisers will contract with a third-party service to host their ads.  In this case, an ad-serving vendor contacts the advertisers’ hosting service to obtain a particular advertisement.  Because we do not have a relationship with these third parties, we do not <a name="Cookies"></a>have a mechanism to allow visitors to opt out of tracking by these vendors.</p>
        <br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

        <h5>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies</h5>
        <p>Front Rush—as well as certain third parties that provide content and other functionality on the Services—may use a variety of technologies to learn more about how people use the Services and the Internet.  This section provides more information about some of those technologies and how they work.</p>

          <div class="container-privacy-indent">
            <br>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies.</span>  Cookies are small text files that websites and other online services use to store information about users on the users’ own computers.  For example, cookies can be used to store your sign-in credentials so that you do not have to enter them each time you return to a website.  Cookies also may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer so that a website can recognize you as the same user across different visits to the website. You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Front Rush and the third parties that provide content or functionality on the Services may use cookies to:</p>
            <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Collect information about your browsing activities in order to provide you with more relevant content and ads off the Services; and</li>
                <br>
                <li>Relate the information automatically collected when you use the Services to information we obtain from you directly or from commercially available sources.</li>
              </ul>
            <br>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other local storage.</span> We, along with third-party partners, may use other kinds of local storage, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with the Services.  These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your computer and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences.  These objects are stored in different parts of your computer from ordinary browser cookies, however.  Many Internet browsers allow you to disable HTML5 local storage or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage using browser controls.</p> 
            <br>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Web beacons.</span>  We, along with our third-party partners, may also use technologies called Web beacons that communicate information from your Internet browser to a web server. Web beacons can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, and can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Web beacon, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Web beacon was viewed.  We and our partners use Web beacons for a variety of purposes, including analyzing the use of the Services and in conjunction with cookies to provide content and ads <a name="California"></a>that are more relevant to you.</p>

If an industry standard on responding to such signals is established and accepted, we may reassess <a name="Links"></a>how to respond to those signals.</p>
