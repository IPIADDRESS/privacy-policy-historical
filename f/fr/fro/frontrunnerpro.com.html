						<h4>FrontRunner Releases New Mobile Manager Version 3.0</h4>
						
						<strong>July 17, 2014 - For immediate release:</strong>
						<p>
						FrontRunner announced today the release of the latest version of its Mobile Management system. The
						new release improves clients' access to their systems from any handheld mobile phone or tablet.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Whether controlled on a smaller cell phone screen or a larger screen such as an iPad or tablet, the 
						Mobile Manager uses responsive technology that auto-adjusts its sizing to be highly functional on any 
						sized device.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						FrontRunner continues to receive rave reviews about the Mobile Manager 1.0 and 2.0 releases. This 
						latest version of the Mobile Case Management System takes the advanced solutions to a whole new 
						level. Some of the features in the new Mobile Manager 3.0 include the ability to add new deceased 
						records, edit existing records, create and modify obituaries, view today's service schedule, access a 
						rolodex of business contacts, submit support requests, access past death records through an easy-to-use 
						search function, view system announcements, and much more. Best of all, the new Mobile Manager 3.0 
						will be included with every Total Business Solution package, empowering funeral professionals with the 
						most advanced and robust solution on the market.  
						</p>
						
						<p>
						"Mobile Manager 3.0 sets the stage for the upcoming release of our new 'Pulse Business System',"
						explains Jason Truesdell, FrontRunner President. "This new system will forever change the way funeral 
						professionals look at management software solutions. A game-changing, single data entry system, 
						that empowers clients with managing and monitoring all of their arrangements, website management, 
						cremation business systems, social media, marketing, and real time analytics. All of this will be accessed 
						from the Mobile Manager 3.0 platform."
						</p>
						
						<p>
						FrontRunner understands the changing business dynamics of today's funeral directors. It is more 
						important than ever to maintain an instant connectivity with your business, even when you're not in the
						office. More importantly, the new Mobile Manager 3.0 will allow clients to take a much needed break 
						while providing the peace of mind that their ability to monitor their day-to-day business is right at their 
						fingertips.  
						</p>
						
						<p>
						"We encourage funeral professionals to look at all of the solutions on the market and then take a look 
						at Frontrunner," cites Kevin Montroy, FrontRunner Founder and CEO. "We think you, like thousands 
						of other professionals, will agree that there is nothing else like FrontRunner solutions. And, with 
						FrontRunner's new flexible financing options, there has never been a better time to get the solution 
						your firm needs."

						<h4>FrontRunner announces new $1.6 million dollar Technology &amp; Training Center</h4>
						
						<strong>July 11, 2014 - For immediate release:</strong>
						<p>
						FrontRunner announced that it has acquired a new 6,500 square foot, $1.6-million dollar facility that 
						will house the new Technology and Training Center. The center represents Frontrunner's ongoing 
						commitment to set a higher standard, and provides all the tools and resources to help clients truly excel 
						in today's market.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						The new state-of-the-art facility will feature a robust schedule of weekly training sessions, advanced 
						strategic marketing presentations, mastering Photoshop workshops, and other key topics designed to 
						help clients grow their businesses. Each new solution sold will now include a full-day of training at the 
						center at no cost, significantly increasing the value of the software. Existing clients can also attend for 
						refresher trainings and to learn how to maximize all the features their systems include. 
						"With all of our new solutions and business systems that are guaranteed to increase market share, the 
						timing of the new Technology and Training Center is more critical to our clients' success than ever," 
						says Ashley Montroy, FrontRunner Marketing Director. "FrontRunner has always had all the solutions 
						and services to truly be the only technology partner firms will ever need. The addition of the new 
						Technology and Training Center now sets the bar even higher."
						</p>
						
						<p>
						The facility will showcase all FrontRunner products and feature the new Wyland Tribute Art Gallery 
						that will be open to visitors from around the world. The center is nestled in Kingston, Ontario, Canada's 
						historic waterfront community making visits as memorable as they are educational. The adjoining Delta 
						Hotel will act as FrontRunner's corporate accommodations partner, making everything conveniently 
						located. And, with Kingston's downtown bustling with great theater, events, restaurants, bars, and 
						nightspots, visitors will want to extend their stays.   
						</p>
						
						<p>
						"FrontRunner will celebrate its 20th anniversary this year and the new facility marks a crowning
						achievement in our evolutionary path. We have been providing innovative solutions, underpinned by 
						integrity and professionalism since 1994," explains Kevin Montroy, FrontRunner CEO and Founder.
						"While other technology firms allow themselves to be bought and sold, FrontRunner continues to be a 
						family owned company remaining true to our clients and our profession since 1994."
						"The future will continue to bring new challenges to funeral professionals. With those challenges will 
						come great opportunity for those who align themselves with a strategically focused technology partner 
						that does more than just peddle websites or management software," adds Montroy.

						<h4>Exclusive Line of TributeArt by Wyland Available</h4>
						
						<strong>April 3, 2014 - For immediate release:</strong>
						<p>
						TributeArt is pleased to introduce the exclusive line of bronze tribute art sculptures by Wyland. These
						exceptional pieces will be marketed exclusively across North America through select FrontRunner
						clients.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Not only are these sculptures treasured collectibles by world renowned Artist of the Seas, Wyland,
						they have been handcrafted to allow for suitable housing of cremated remains, flower petals or other
						mementos. There are four (4) different sculptures available in full and miniature versions.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Through a unique sales initiative, select FrontRunner clients will receive credit for every sculpture sold
						within their area, whether through their website or from consumers purchasing through the main
						TributeArt.com site. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
						TributeArt represents a higher standard for funeral firms and their families while adding a new level
						of profitability. This new program will be a game changer for select FrontRunner client firms who will
						be aligned with more than 500,000 collectors of Wyland fine art. TributeArt creates the ability to fulfill
						orders, even on pre-arrangement contracts, given the quality and beauty of bronze collectible sculptures
						that any family would be proud to display.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						"I have been working with Wyland and his team for over a year now to bring together this highly
						anticipated and exciting offering," says Kevin Montroy, TributeArt founder and FrontRunner CEO. "In
						my opinion, consumers are not telling funeral service they don't have money. For many, they simply no
						longer see the value in spending a large amount of money on a casket that will be either cremated or
						buried in the ground, never to be seen again."
						TributeArt is just one more example of how FrontRunner is doing more to help clients grow their
						businesses.   
						</p>
						
						<p>
						"In all of my experience in funeral service, I have never seen this level of quality and focus on a product
						that will impact so many funeral professionals," explains Chris Farmer, TributeArt Partner. "TributeArt
						truly sets a new standard of quality and will change consumers' perception of what urns should look like
						by instilling the concept of Art of Remembrance."  
						</p>
						
						<p>
						The first of the bronze TributeArt sculptures will be unveiled at the ICCFA Convention next week in Las
						Vegas. FrontRunner Professional: providing innovative solutions, underpinned by integrity and professionalism,
						since 1994.

						<h4>FrontRunner's New Technology to Ensure Funeral Professionals' Right to Choose</h4>
						
						<strong>April 1, 2014 - For immediate release:</strong>
						<p>
						FrontRunner announced today the release of the latest version of its Mobile Management system. The
						new release improves clients' access to their systems from any handheld mobile phone or tablet.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						FrontRunner will begin development of a new feature in its management system designed to stop
						funeral homes from being held hostage by funeral home management software vendors. 
						Morph will allow a user to switch the FrontRunner management interface to mimic the look and feel of 
						their existing management software. Gone will be the nonsense tactics, leaving funeral professionals 
						with the freedom to work in a new technology system that incorporates their management data and 
						eliminates the need for staff to learn a new management program.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						FrontRunner prides itself on always looking out for funeral professionals and creating a higher standard 
						for all. It pioneered the concept of management and website integration to create higher efficiencies. 
						FrontRunner then developed a connector kit to seamlessly hook up to any management system on the 
						market so clients would never feel forced to use its management software.  
						</p>
						
						<p>
						 "Clients have a right to choose the best system to meet their needs, which is why I am appalled at the 
						stories we hear from our clients whose existing management vendors refuse to hook up FrontRunner 
						websites with their software," explains Kevin Montroy, FrontRunner CEO and Founder. "Some of our 
						new clients are also put through pure hell when they try to retrieve their data from these companies. 
						This is a travesty for funeral professionals and we will be working with the legal community to rid 
						funeral service of these unsavory practices." 
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Montroy adds that there are a few, blatantly unprofessional companies out there causing problems for 
						funeral professionals. Their management software will be the focus of the first interface developments. 
						FrontRunner will continue to add new interfaces in Morph for any management software vendor that 
						denies its clients their right to choose the website of their choice.  
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Since the acquisition of Halcyon Software, FrontRunner's management system is being hailed as the 
						best new management software on the market. It is the only true, completely integrated solution in 
						existence. Best of all, it is very affordable and free of support fees.   
						</p>
