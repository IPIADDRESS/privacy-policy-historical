  <p><span class="style2">At Frontier, our customers are #1, and since we value our own privacy, we extend that to you as well. Because of this, we WILL NOT sell or share our customer information with anyone. We collect email information from those who wish to receive email from us (we do not send unsolicited email). We only save shipping and billing information if you have saved this information as part of your Customer Profile. Any information that is collected via "trails" (the trail you leave as you travel through our site) is only reviewed internally and then discarded. Your trust is important to us, and we will not do anything to violate that trust.</span></p>
