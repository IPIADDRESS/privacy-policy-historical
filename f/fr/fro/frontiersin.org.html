<meta name="description" content="- Frontiers is an open-access academic publisher pioneering a new approach to seek, share and generate scholarly research knowledge. 
- Frontiers publishes the Frontiers Journal Series, an interdisciplinary tiered set of open-access online journals, covering an increasing number of fields, including Neurology, Neuroscience, Pharmacology, Physiology, Psychiatry, Psychology.
- Frontiers Community aims at serving the needs of all research-related communities, ranging from scholars to the educated public and various types of organizations. The services covered span from event organization to job offers, and purchase of research material, with many more to be introduced later on. 
- Special Topics are one of Frontiersâ€™ most powerful tools to foster cross-disciplinary communication, and they have become a popular trademark of the Frontiers Journal Series. Special Topics are collections of at least ten articles of any tier 1 article type, centered on a hot topic in a particular research area, making them a very effective method for gathering the key knowledge around a topic and bringing focus to it.
- Specialties compose the lowest level (tier 1) of the Frontiers taxonomy. They are independent from fields and free to float across the various Frontiers fields that are relevant to them, because they aim at reflecting the criss-crossed nature of academic research.
- Themes are non-scholarly journal sections dedicated to a hot topic of public interest. Contributions to themes span from research highlights, to industry overviews and funding opportunities.
- Every Frontiers Journal is run by a Board of Editors to which only world-class experts may be appointed.
- The Frontiers Research Foundation is a not-for-profit foundation based in Lausanne (Switzerland), in the spirit of neutrality and guided by core principles such as equal opportunity to generate, share and seek knowledge worldwide. It partially subsidizes the publication of the Frontiers Journal Series.
- Frontiers Media SA (or simply Frontiers) is a Swiss corporation with its principal base of business in Lausanne (Switzerland) that is active in the area of academic publishing and research networking.
