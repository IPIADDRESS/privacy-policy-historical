<p>
After you purchase one of our Apps, we may also send transaction-related communications such as welcome emails, order confirmations, and payment transaction notices. You expressly agree to receive this information. We may from time to time send you marketing or promotional communications, unless you elect to opt out of receiving such information.  You can discontinue future promotional communications by following the specific unsubscribe instructions in the communications you receive.
