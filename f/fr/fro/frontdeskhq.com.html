<p><br>Front Desk believes in respecting and protecting your privacy. The following Privacy Policy applies to the information collected when you use our software applications (“App(s)”) or other services on your mobile device or computer. This policy explains how we collect, store, protect, and use information that you provide us. Front Desk may be referred to herein as “we” or “us“ or “our.” Users of our website might be referred to as “you” or “your.”</p>

<h3><br>1. Collection and use of information</h3>

<p>When you register and download an App with us, we collect certain information from you. e.g. name, address, zip code, phone, email address, user name, password and other registration related information (“Personal Information”) as well as IP address, browser type, and operating system. Where applicable, we may also collect transaction-related information. We may share your Personal Information with third-party vendors and hosting partners as necessary to provide the Apps and services we offer and to maintain a high quality user experience. We may also collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. We use a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.</p>

<p><br>After you purchase one of our Apps, we may also send transaction-related communications such as welcome emails, order confirmations, and payment transaction notices. You expressly agree to receive this information. We may from time to time send you marketing or promotional communications, unless you elect to opt out of receiving such information. You can discontinue future promotional communications by following the specific unsubscribe instructions in the communications you receive. This information is used only for internal statistic tracking purposes and is never shared with other entities outside Front Desk unless required by law or as otherwise disclosed within this policy.<br></p>
