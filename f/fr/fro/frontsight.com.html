                        <strong>2. Web Site Use Information</strong><br>
                      Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard  technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are  Cookies?") and web server log files to collect information about how  our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web  server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed,  time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and  just after our Web site. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>How Do We  Use the Information That You Provide to Us? </strong></p>
                    <p>Broadly speaking,  we use personal information for purposes of administering our business  activities, providing the products and services you requested, to  process your payment, , to monitor the use of the  service, our  marketing and promotional efforts and improve our content and  service offerings, and customize our site's content, layout, services and for other lawful  purposes.  These uses improve our site and better tailor it to meet your needs. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, such  information may be shared with others on an aggregate basis. Personally  identifiable information or business information will not be shared  with parties except as required by law. </p>
                    <p>Occasionally, we  may also use the information we collect to notify you about important  changes to our Website, new services, and special offers we think you  will find valuable.

                    </p>
                    <p><strong>What Are  Cookies?</strong><br>
                      A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an  anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's  computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part  of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site  can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences  allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web  site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies  sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies.  However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the  configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have  your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site  will not function as effectively when viewed by the users. <strong>A cookie cannot retrieve  any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses. </strong></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>How Do We  Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</strong><br>
                      As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to  differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies  to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for  security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files,  allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web  site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather  feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our  clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information  about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information  that your browser provided to us in your cookies. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>IP  Addresses</strong><br>
                      IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to  the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on  the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically  collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data  known as “traffic data” so that data (such as the Web pages you  request) can be sent to you. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Sharing  and Selling Information</strong><br>
                      We <strong>do not</strong> share, sell, lend or lease any of the information  that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or  personal details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to  process transactions or provide services that you have requested. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>How Can  You Access and Correct Your Information?</strong><br>
                      You may request access to all your personally identifiable information  that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us at  the usual address. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>What About  Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?<br>
                    </strong>We may  disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words,  when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the  protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose  account information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this  information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action  against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect  the safety of our users and the Public. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>What  About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</strong><br>

                    </p>
                    <p>Please remember  that when you use a link to go from our Website to another web site,  our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and  interaction on any other web site, including web sites, which have a  link on our Website, is subject to that Web site's own rules and  policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. </p>

                    <p><strong>Your  Consent</strong><br>
                      By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your  personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve  the right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or without  notice. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><em><strong>Our  Commitment To Data Security:</strong></em> </p>
                    <p>Please note that  your information will be stored and processed on our computers in the  United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United States  may be less stringent than the laws of your Country of residence or  citizenship. To  prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the  correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,  electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the  information we collect online. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out<br>

                    <p><strong>Surveys &amp;  Contests </strong></p>
                    <p>From time-to-time  our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and  the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this  information. Information requested may include contact information  (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such  as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the  winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes  of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>A Special Note  About Children </strong></p>
                    <p>Children are not  eligible to use our services unsupervised and we ask  that children (under  the age of 14) do not submit any personal information to us. If you are  a minor, you can use this service only in conjunction with permission  and guidance from your parents or guardians. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Acquisition or  Changes in Ownership</strong> </p>
                    <p>In the event that  the web site (or a substantial portion of its assets) is acquired, your  information would be considered part of those assets, and may be part  of those assets that are transferred. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Emails We Send </strong> </p>
                    <p>After subscribing to our email list, we will provide you with the series of emails entitled "Gun Training Reports." We will additionally send you exclusive offers and promotions that you will only see by being a Front Sight Email Subscriber. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Policy  Modifications<br>
                    </strong>We may  change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes are made  to this privacy policy, we will email users who have given us  permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check  back periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy  Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal information  you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is  materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior  consent.</p>
