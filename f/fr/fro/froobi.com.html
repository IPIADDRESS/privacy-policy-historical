<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>ORDER ACCEPTANCE POLICY</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your   receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not   signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute   confirmation of our offer to sell. Froobi.com reserves the right at any   time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any   reason. Froobi.com reserves the right at any time after receipt of your   order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity   you ordered of any item. All orders placed over $500.00 ( USD ) must   obtain pre-approval with an acceptable method of payment, as established   by our credit and fraud avoidance department. We may require additional   verifications or information before accepting any order. Froobi.com is a   reseller to end user customers and does not accept orders from computer   dealers, exporters, wholesalers, or other customers who intend to   resell the products offered by Froobi.com.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>PROCESSING TIME</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If   the item(s) on your order are in-stock, we will ship them as soon as   possible from our warehouse or from one of our Distribution Warehouses   located throughout the United States. If the item(s) on your order are   out of stock, they will not be shipped until we have received and   processed the backordered inventory in our warehouse.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>LISTINGS AND OFFERS</strong><br> Listings   on this website are not an offer to sell goods, rather, they are   advertisements to receive offers. Any offer/order for more than 3 units   per address, customer or company may be rejected, and all orders are   subject to review and acceptance by Froobi.com. As all prices are   subject to change, your order may not be accepted or we may have to   communicate price changes or availability issues to you after you place   your order.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>RETURN POLICY AND LIMITED GUARANTEE AGAINST DEFECTS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unless the item you ordered is considered Dead On Arrival (DOA), Froobi.com does not accept returns. This policy is due to the fact that our items are only available for one day and are already priced far below the retail value. Most of the products you buy from us are backed by the manufacturer's warranty that will cover issues of the item being broken or defective. If the item you received is DOA then it will be covered by our 14 day limited warranty.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Froobi.com's 14 day limited warranty is a defective exchange policy that provides   for either repair or replacement (at our sole discretion) of merchandise   that has been confirmed as DOA by either the manufacturer or   Froobi.com. The 14 day limited warranty does not cover damages caused by shipping, normal wear and tear, faulty packaging, or cosmetic issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If the product you received qualifies for the Froobi.com 14 day limited warranty, please contact us at our <a href="http://temp.froobi.com/contact/">Customer Support Page</a> or by email at support@froobi.com. We will send you an RMA form which you will need to include when you send us back the item. Products returned for exchange must be in new condition, original   packaging and include all disks, registration cards, packing materials   and other accessories, and be postmarked within 14 days of the invoice   date. We will provide a replacement item or refund, not including shipping and handling. Customer is responsible for all freight charges.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After 14 days the product manufacturer warranty is the only warranty in    effect. Terms and conditions may vary by product or manufacturer.    Froobi.com will assist customers whenever possible in gaining    satisfaction with product manufacturers.</p>

If you use a financing option, information provided by   you (such as your address, birth date, social security number, and   credit card number) may be used to request a credit report from third   parties or may be sent to a third party for processing. You will always   be informed of this at the time you select any available financing   option. All information obtained from you in the course of transacting   orders is used for the purpose of fulfilling your order in a timely   manner and for communicating the status of your order with you.   Additionally, upon placing an order, you may begin receiving the   Froobi.com email newsletter unless you opt-out by contacting us through   our Contact Page.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Email Newsletter Subscription:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If   you request an email newsletter subscription, we will send you an email   confirming your request. This confirmation process allows you to   unsubscribe if you changed your mind and decided not to join the list.   Furthermore, the confirmation email will alert you if someone else had   entered your email address into our email newsletter. In order to make   our emails more relevant and useful to you, our servers may receive a   confirmation when you open email from Froobi.com.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Independent   Contractors: We may employ other companies or individuals to provide   certain services to us such as analyzing customer lists and data,   providing marketing assistance, or consulting services. These third   parties will have access to the information needed to perform their   functions but cannot use that information for any other purpose. Any 3rd   parties who use our data will be fully bound by this privacy policy. In   no event will the data being used by any unrelated third party include   your email address.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Orders:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We   will never share any telephone number(s), e-mail addresses, or credit   card information which you have given us with any marketing partner(s)   or any unrelated 3rd party. We may, however, share your name and postal   mailing address with a few carefully selected marketing partners. You   may opt-out of sharing this information at any time by contacting our   customer service department from our Contact Page&nbsp;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Aggregate information:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We   provide aggregate information to some of our business partners. This   information does not allow them to identify you individually in any way.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Credit card companies and shippers:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When   you buy something from us we send your credit card information, name,   billing address and the amount of your purchase to your credit card   company to verify and authorize the purchase. Your name, telephone   number and shipping information must be provided to third party shippers   such as UPS, Federal Express and the United States Postal Service to   deliver your purchase. There also may be instances in which we drop-ship   orders directly to you from one of our manufacturers or suppliers.   These drop-shippers are only given your name, postal address, and   telephone number for the sole purpose of fulfilling your order.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Third Party Transaction-Level Data:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If   you visit our site from a third-party site the third-party site may be   able to access select information from your individual transaction   information. In order to track and credit your transaction the   third-party site may give you a unique code, cookie or graphic which   will uniquely identify you. This will only happen if you link directly   from a third party site to our Web site. Any transactions made at our   Web site while such a code is active will be reported back to the third   party site. We will only report non-personal information to these sites   such as the date of the transaction, the product(s) purchased and the   amount spent. We will not report any information to these third party   sites that will allow them to personally identify you and will never   share your email address with any 3rd party. The presence of a 3rd party   navigation bar atop our site is an indication that the third party site   may be able to see your activity on our site.</p>
