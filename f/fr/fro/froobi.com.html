<p><strong>Information you give us:</strong></p>
<p>Froobi.com collects any information which you enter on our Web site. This information 
  is normally provided when you search, buy, participate in a contest, sweepstakes 
  or on-line survey, or when you communicate with any of our departments such 
  as customer service, sales or technical services through our Web site, telephone, 
  mail or fax. You also provide information when you establish an account with

  we ask you for other people’s names and email addresses for the sole purpose 
  of fulfilling your specific request to email certain specific information as 
  part of our “email a friend” feature.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic Information collected by us:</strong></p>
<p>We (or agents on our behalf) collect anonymous information from visits to our 
  sites through the use of “Web Beacons.” Web Beacons are simply web 
  page elements which may employ cookie technology that enable us to record anonymous 
  data about visits to or transactions made on our web site. This anonymous information 
  is sometimes known as “clickstream data.” We may use this data to 
  analyze trends and statistics to improve your online experience, or customer 
  service. No personal data is collected through the use of Web Beacons on our 
  sites. Through the use of cookies, we may also collect and analyze the IP address

  are welcomed at our Web site if you use this software but we will not be able 
  to offer you our personalized services and we will be unable to accept any online 
  orders from you.</p>
<p><strong>Orders:</strong></p>
<p>If you place an order we use a secure order form which requires you to provide 
  contact, billing, and financial information. This information is transmitted 
  to your credit card company to authorize your purchase. At certain times we 
  may offer financing options with or without third party participation. If you 
  use a financing option, information provided by you (such as your address, birth 
  date, social security number, and credit card number) may be used to request 
  a credit report from third parties or may be sent to a third party for processing. 
  You will always be informed of this at the time you select any available financing 
  option. All information obtained from you in the course of transacting orders 
  is used for the purpose of fulfilling your order in a timely manner and for 
  communicating the status of your order with you. Additionally, upon placing 
  an order, you will begin receiving both the Froobi.com catalog and the Froobi.com 
  email newsletter unless you opt-out of either or both by emailing us at support@froobi.com.</p>

<p>If you request an email newsletter subscription, we will send you an email 
  confirming your request. This confirmation process allows you to unsubscribe 
  if you changed your mind and decided not to join the list. Furthermore, the 
  confirmation email will alert you if someone else had entered your email address 
  into our email newsletter.In order to make our emails more relevant and useful 
  to you, our servers may receive a confirmation when you open email from Froobi.com.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing of Information with third-parties:</strong></p>
<p>Independent Contractors: We may employ other companies or individuals to provide 
  certain services to us such as analyzing customer lists and data, providing 
  marketing assistance, or consulting services. These third parties will have 
  access to the information needed to perform their functions but cannot use that 
  information for any other purpose. Any 3rd parties who use our data will be 
  fully bound by this privacy policy. In no event will the data being used by 
  any unrelated third party include your email address.</p>
<p><strong>Orders:</strong></p>
<p>We will never share any telephone number(s), e-mail addresses, or credit card 
  information which you have given us with any marketing partner(s) or any unrelated 
  3rd party. We may, however, share your name and postal mailing address with 
  a few carefully selected marketing partners. You may opt-out of sharing this 
  information at any time by contacting our customer service department at support@froobi.com 
  .</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate information:</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregate information to some of our business partners. This information 
  does not allow them to identify you individually in any way.</p>
<p><strong>Credit card companies and shippers:</strong></p>
<p>When you buy something from us we send your credit card information, name, 
  billing address and the amount of your purchase to your credit card company 
  to verify and authorize the purchase. Your name, telephone number and shipping 
  information must be provided to third party shippers such as UPS, Federal Express 
  and the United States Postal Service to deliver your purchase. There also may 
  be instances in which we drop-ship orders directly to you from one of our manufacturers 
  or suppliers. These drop-shippers are only given your name, postal address, 
  and telephone number for the sole purpose of fulfilling your order.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Transaction-Level Data:</strong></p>
<p>If you visit our site from a third-party site the third-party site may be able 
  to access select information from your individual transaction information. In 
  order to track and credit your transaction the third-party site may give you 
  a unique code, cookie or graphic which will uniquely identify you. This will 
  only happen if you link directly from a third party site to our Web site. Any 
  transactions made at our Web site while such a code is active will be reported 
  back to the third party site. We will only report non-personal information to 
  these sites such as the date of the transaction, the product(s) purchased and 
  the amount spent. We will not report any information to these third party sites 
  that will allow them to personally identify you and will never share your email 
  address with any 3rd party. The presence of a 3rd party navigation bar atop 
  our site is an indication that the third party site may be able to see your 
  activity on our site</p>

<p>Our Web site contains certain links to third party sites, such as our vendors. 
  Froobi.com is not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or content 
  found on these sites. We suggest that you check the Privacy Notice of each site

  when we believe it is appropriate for us to do so to comply with the law. We 
  will also do so to cooperate with law enforcement investigations, comply with 
  court orders or subpoenas, protect the legal rights of us and our users, or 
  when we believe it is needed for fraud protection and/ or credit risk reduction.</p>

  whether voluntarily or involuntarily, or merges or becomes affiliated with any 
  other division, individual or entity, any customer information owned or under 
  the control of Froobi.com may be one of the transferred assets.</p>

  which require you to provide your personal or account information, including 
  online ordering, order status, catalog request and most contest forms. Your 
  name, your personal information and especially your credit card number are safely 
  stored in our proprietary systems behind our firewall. Once you type your personal 
  information, it is sent instantly, encrypted, directly to our order processing 
  system which is on a server separate from our internet server. To make sure 
  you have the latest security features on your browser, you may want to download 
  the most recent version of your favorite browser, which should have full SSL 
  support.</p>

  from us. If you no longer wish to receive communications from us you may opt-out 
  by contacting us at support@froobi.com.</p>
<p><strong>SSL Data Encryption:</strong></p>
<p>Our Froobi.com website is registered with site identification authorities to 
  enable your browser to confirm our security identity before any transmission 
  is sent. With this technology, the identity of our site is automatically confirmed 
  behind the scenes prior to the transmission of any customer information requested 
  to complete an online order and ensures that your data reaches your intended 
  target or your browser notifies you (prior to your sending any personal information) 
  that the potential receiving site looks suspicious and should be avoided. Security 
  Guarantee If you are using a security-enabled browser (such as Microsoft Internet 
  Explorer version 2.1 or greater, or Netscape Navigator version 2.0 or greater), 
  the information you send us regarding your purchase is encrypted, making it 
  extremely difficult to read even if it is wrongly intercepted. At Froobi.com, 
  we utilize industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow 
  for the encryption of: potentially sensitive information such as your name and 
  address and other critically sensitive information like your credit card number. 
  Standing behind our security technology, we also provide our Website Security 
  Guarantee, further ensuring that you are protected every time you buy online 
  with us. For more details, take a look at this guarantee.<br>
