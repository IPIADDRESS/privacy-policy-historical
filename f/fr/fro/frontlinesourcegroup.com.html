<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to users' privacy, we have disclosed our information practices.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should contact Frontline Source Group, Inc. customer service at <a href="http://www.frontlinesourcegroup.com/contact_info.htm">Questions/Concerns</a>.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scope</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This Privacy Policy covers frontline source group treatment of personally identifiable information that we collect when you are on frontline source group web site and when you use our services. This policy also covers our treatment of any personally identifiable information that our business partners or customers share with us.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that frontline source group, inc. does not own or control, or to individuals that frontline source group, inc. does not employ or manage, including operators of sites to which may link from the frontline source group, inc. web site. This policy also does not apply to any off-line collection of personally identifiable information or the treatment of the same when such information is collected outside of the frontline source group site.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What information do we gather?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The only individually identifiable information that we collect about you is that which you choose to share with us in registration, when using our products and services, or when responding to offers from frontline source group or from our business partners or customers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We also collect information about aggregate site usage. Statistics that we gather about unique visits, referring URL's, repeat visits and page views are all based on IP address, and are not associated with your personal information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the time of registration, we only ask for your email address and a user name you select. From time to time, frontline source group may survey its members for additional personal information. Aggregate information about our users is valuable to our advertisers as it provides them with more effective channels for reaching potential customers. Without advertising support, we could not keep the Web site free for use. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We share aggregate information with our partners and advertisers. We will not share your personally identifiable information with any third party, unless we tell you otherwise when we collect the information, you have consented by "opting in" to being contacted by frontline source group, its third party partners or advertisers, or we have informed you of a change to our privacy policy so that you can then choose to opt out. We will give you a way to "opt out" of being contacted by frontline source group.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In short, the information you provide us can help us understand how to make our Web site more useful to our users.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Opting-Out.</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We do not share your personally identifiable information with anyone, unless we tell you otherwise when we collect the information, you "opt-in" to having your information shared with third parties, or we have informed you of a change to our privacy policy so that you can choose to opt out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When we ask you for personal information, such as the kind of information we may ask you for through a survey, or through a request for an investor kit on a company we featured in frontline source group, we will tell you if we intend to share it with others. Once you have "opted in" and agreed that your information may be shared with third parties or you have responded to an offer by any third party on the frontline source group, inc. Web sites, frontline source group can no longer update any of your personally identifiable information that has been transferred to such third parties or opt you out of such third parties so that you no longer receive their promotional and/or marketing information. Instead, you must either contact that third party or refer to their privacy policy to update your personally identifiable information or to let them know that you no longer want to receive promotional and/or marketing information about their products, services, or offerings.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What information do we collect?</font></b></p>
 <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The only individual identifiable information that we collect about you is that which you choose to share with us in registration, when you use our products or services that require you to provide personal information about yourself, when responding to offers from frontline source group or from our third party business partners or advertisers, or when responding to surveys from us or our third party business partners (including without limitation surveys for online advertising brand effectiveness), or requests for investor kits on companies we may feature in our Web sites.
