<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because 
we want to demonstrate our commitment to users' privacy, 
we have disclosed our information practices.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, 
they should contact Frontline Source Group, Inc. customer service 
at <a href="mailto:info@frtline.com?subject=Privacy Policy">Questions/Concerns</a>.

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
Privacy Policy covers frontline source group treatment of personally 
identifiable information that we collect when you are on frontline source group web site and when you use our services. This policy 
also covers our treatment of any personally identifiable information 
that our business partners or customers share with us.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
policy does not apply to the practices of companies that frontline source group, inc. does not own 
or control, or to individuals that frontline source group, inc. does not 
employ or manage, including operators of sites to which may 
link from the frontline source group, inc. web site. This policy also does 
not apply to any off-line collection of personally identifiable 
information or the treatment of the same when such information is 
collected outside of the frontline source group site.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
information do we gather?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
only individually identifiable information that we collect about 
you is that which you choose to share with us in registration, when 
using our products and services, or when responding to offers from 
frontline source group or from our business partners or customers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
also collect information about aggregate site usage. Statistics 
that we gather about unique visits, referring URL's, repeat visits 
and page views are all based on IP address, and are not associated 
with your personal information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
the time of registration, we only ask for your email address and 
a user name you select. From time to time, frontline source group may survey its members for additional personal information. Aggregate 
information about our users is valuable to our advertisers as it 
provides them with more effective channels for reaching potential 
customers. Without advertising support, we could not keep the Web 
site free for use. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
share aggregate information with our partners and advertisers. We 
will not share your personally identifiable information with any 
third party, unless we tell you otherwise when we collect the information, 
you have consented by "opting in" to being contacted by 
frontline source group, its third party partners or advertisers, or 
we have informed you of a change to our privacy policy so that you 
can then choose to opt out. We will give you a way to "opt 
out" of being contacted by frontline source group.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
short, the information you provide us can help us understand how 
to make our Web site more useful to our users.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Opting-Out.</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
do not share your personally identifiable information with anyone, 
unless we tell you otherwise when we collect the information, you 
"opt-in" to having your information shared with third 
parties, or we have informed you of a change to our privacy policy 
so that you can choose to opt out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
we ask you for personal information, such as the kind of information 
we may ask you for through a survey, or through a request for an 
investor kit on a company we featured in frontline source group, we 
will tell you if we intend to share it with others. Once you have 
"opted in" and agreed that your information may be shared 
with third parties or you have responded to an offer by any third 
party on the frontline source group, inc. Web sites, frontline source group 
can no longer update any of your personally identifiable information 
that has been transferred to such third parties or opt you out of 
such third parties so that you no longer receive their promotional 
and/or marketing information. Instead, you must either contact that 
third party or refer to their privacy policy to update your personally 
identifiable information or to let them know that you no longer 
want to receive promotional and/or marketing information about their 
products, services, or offerings.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
information do we collect?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
only individual identifiable information that we collect about you 
is that which you choose to share with us in registration, when 
you use our products or services that require you to provide personal 
information about yourself, when responding to offers from frontline source group or from our third party business partners or advertisers, 
or when responding to surveys from us or our third party business 
partners (including without limitation surveys for online advertising 
brand effectiveness), or requests for investor kits on companies 
we may feature in our Web sites. As stated earlier, this information 
will be closely protected and used for internal purposes only, unless 
we tell you otherwise when we collect the information, you have 
consented by "opting in" to be contacted by frontline source group its partners and advertisers, and other third parties, or 
we have informed you of a change to our privacy policy so that you 
can then choose to opt out. We will never willfully release your 
personal information to any third party without providing you notice 
unless: you direct us to enter you in a contest; sign you up for 
a service which is sponsored by one of our partners; you direct 
us to provide your information to a company we profiled when you 
"opt in" for their investor kit; you otherwise "opt 
in" to have your information shared with third parties; we 
respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; we find your 
actions on our Web site violate our Terms of Use or any of our usage 
guidelines for specific products or services (and then only to pursue 
appropriate action); or we transfer your information in connection 
with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether 
assets, stock or otherwise), of all or a portion of a business of 
frontline source group, inc. If, however, as a result of the business transfer 
your personal information will be used in a new and different manner, 
then you will have a choice as to whether to allow this new use.</font></p>

provide may be used to derive city and state information or may 
be used to add demographics data.</font></p>

to the frontline source group Privacy Policy.</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">frontline source group may amend this policy from time to time. If we make 
any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information 
we will notify you by posting a prominent notice in our privacy 
policy or in other locations on our Web site or by sending you an 
email to inform you of our updated privacy policy. Users will have 
a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different
