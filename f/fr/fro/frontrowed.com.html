<span class="c0">1.1 Consent</span>
</h2>
<p class="c2"><span>By using our Services and supplying information to us, or by using the Front Row Application, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by us for the purpose of providing Services to you via the Front Row Application, and administering your account in accordance with: (a) this Policy, (b) any other agreement you may have entered into with us, and (c) applicable laws and regulations.

<span class="c0">1.2 Collection of User Information</span>

<span class="c0">1.3 Collection of Student Information</span>
</h2>
<p class="c2"><span>Front Row collects limited personal information from minor students, only as needed for the operation and management of the Services provided by Front Row, and only where that student’s school board, educational institution or teacher has contracted with Front Row to do so. We first require the school board, educational institution or teacher to obtain the consent of parents/legal guardians prior to collecting such information. If you are a minor student, do not send any personal information about yourself or other students to Front Row, other than what is requested upon signing up for the Services. In the event that we discover we have the personal information of a student without consent of a parent/legal guardian, or information in excess of what we request upon sign-up, we will permanently destroy that information as quickly as possible. If you believe a student may have provided us personal information without consent of a parent/legal guardian, or information in excess of what we request upon sign-up, please contact us at support</span>
<span>@frontrowed.com</span>
<span>. Students who have signed up with an access code provided by a school or teacher should be aware that their parent/legal guardian has access to all information within or associated with their Front Row account, including, but not limited to, messages between other students, teachers, and assignment grades. All teachers within a single course group in the password-protected portion of the Front Row site have the ability to view student profiles, but visibility is limited to such information as their names and scores. Students are unable to see the grades of other students, irrespective of whether or not they are members of the same course group on the site. </span>
<span class="c1">If a school or district requests deletion of students’ personal information under the control of the school or district, please contact us at support</span>
<span class="c1">@frontrowed.com</span>
<span class="c1">and we will permanently destroy that information as quickly as practicable.</span>
