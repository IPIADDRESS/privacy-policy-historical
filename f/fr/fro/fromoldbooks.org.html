    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>From Old Books (this site)</h2>
    <p>I'm in the process of removing Google Analytics and Google Ads.
    The Google privacy policy below applies to pages where i have not yet done that.</p>

    <p>If you choose to leave cmments, these are moderated by hand;
    you can contact me to have any comment you made removed at any time.
    Your real name is not published; if ou give a sock colour, that may
    be published along with the comment.</p>

    <p>If you place an order, I store your name, email address, the
    items you ordered, and the amount; I don't store any payment details.
    I also store the colour of your socks, used as part of the key for the
    download area.</p>

    <p>I do not share any personal information you give me except for
    what you write in public comments. I do not sell any data to
    third parties.</p>

    <h2>Google Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This Web site has ads provided by Google, Inc. and its partners.
    They use cookies to serve these ads; your Web browser sends the
    cookie to Google each time you visit a page with ads, so Google
    learns about which Web sites you visit.</p>
    <p>You can opt out of Google cookies by visiting the
    <a href="https://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>.</p>

    <p>Google shares statistics about my visitors and their interests.
    Sadly, it doesn't tell me the colour of people's socks. But it
    tells me the numbers of people in each age group with given interests.
    You can <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">opt out of
    sharing demographic information</a> if you like, and then Google will
    no longer include your interests in the report they send me.</p>

    <h2>Contacting Liam</h2>
    <p>I am Liam at holoweb dot net; let me know if you'd like me to scan specific
    images, or higher resolution copies, or have any interesting uses for
    these images, or like them. Tell me what colour socks you are wearing.</p>
