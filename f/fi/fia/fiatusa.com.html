							<p>PRIVACY POLICY</p>
							
							<p>Effective Date: August 30, 2010</p>
							<p>Welcome to the Chrysler Group LLC (“Chrysler”). At the Chrysler family of companies, we believe it is important to protect the privacy of our customers and guests. We know that you care about how your personal information is collected, used, and shared and we want to help you make knowledgeable choices about the information you provide to us. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains and summarizes how Chrysler collects, uses, and protects your information, including the personal information that you may provide to us or that we may collect from you as you interact with us online, through mobile device applications, and through our customer and technical support services. We will update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please check back with us periodically.</p>
							<p>This Privacy Policy applies to this website or application, Chrysler controlled websites or applications, and all Chrysler controlled applications accessed and/or used on a mobile or handheld device (each a “Website” or “Application”). By using this Website or Application, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information by Chrysler consistent with applicable data protection law and this Privacy Policy which is expressly incorporated into any applicable Website or Application Terms of Use.</p>
							<p>This Privacy Policy explains the information practices of Chrysler including:</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>How Chrysler uses the personal information you share with us and that we learn about you because of our relationship.</li>
								<li>How Chrysler uses “cookies” and related information collected automatically when you use our Website or Applications.</li>
								<li>What personal information, if any, Chrysler may share about you and the conditions we use to protect your information if it must be shared.</li>
								<li>What kind of security measures Chrysler takes to protect your information from accidental loss or disclosure and how Chrysler will inform you in the event of a security breach.</li>
								<li>The process through which you can access personal information you share with Chrysler and have that information corrected, restrict Chrysler’s use of that information, or have it removed from our records.</li>
								<li>Other things you should know about privacy and Chrysler.</li>
								<li>Much of this policy relates to personal Information. “Personal information” includes information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<h2>COLLECTED INFORMATION AND USAGE</h2>
							<p>Chrysler collects and uses the information you provide to us, including information obtained from your use of this Chrysler Website or Application. We may also obtain information about you from outside sources. For example, we may request credit information about you from credit agencies for the purpose of providing a service to you, obtain commercially available demographic and marketing information about you from third parties, or purchase e-mail or similar lists from third parties for advertising and marketing purposes. We may use or share your Personal Information (e.g., name, address, telephone number, email address, and location) where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something that you have asked us to do. We may also use this information for our internal research purposes as we develop our products and services and for advertising and marketing.</p>
							<p>For example, we might need to provide your name, address, phone number, or email to one of our dealers or another party with whom we have a relationship so that they can help us respond to you or a request you made through one of our Websites. Chrysler employees, agents, and service providers, who need to access Personal Information you have provided to fulfill their responsibilities, may do so consistent with Chrysler policies that limit access to this type of information. Chrysler’s vendors and suppliers may process your personal data under the direction of Chrysler.</p>
							<p>Chrysler collects and uses information from you in several ways:</p>
							<p>Website or Application Usage. Chrysler (or Chrysler vendors and suppliers) may observe your activities, preferences, and transactional data (such as your IP address and browser type) as well as pages you have viewed during your use of the Website or Application. We may use this data for any purpose unless we tell you otherwise in connection with a particular Website or Application. While we may collect or log this information, we do not identify you or match this non-Personal Information with your other Personal Information unless or except if we believe doing so will help us better respond to a request you have made such as for a quote, identification of a local dealer, or similar request. With the exception of Location-Data, described below, where such non-Personal Information is linked to your Personal Information we will treat such information as Personal Information.</p>
							<p>Location Data. Some Chrysler Websites or Applications may need to capture and record certain location-data regarding your use of that Website or Application and your travels in order to provide location-related functionality (“Location-Data”). We may link that Location-Data to other information that you provide to us or that may be accessed in connection with your use of such a Chrysler Website or Application. Your use of, and our ability to offer functionality through, the Chrysler Website or Application is then enabled through our use and disclosure to third parties of Location-Data and associated information.</p>
							<p>E-Commerce. You may be asked to share Personal Information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address. When you purchase a Chrysler product online, seek a quote or ask to locate a dealer, you may be asked for information needed to complete your request and provide related customer service. This information you provide is used, for example, to process your transactions, to create and share aggregate reports about these transactions, and to perform credit fraud screening services for transactions between you and Chrysler and/or our authorized service providers. When you shop online or buy direct from one of our online stores, these purchase transactions may be conducted through Chrysler vendors and suppliers. Vendors and suppliers engaged by Chrysler may have their use of your Personal Information limited by this Privacy Policy, contractual restrictions, and applicable law. Chrysler (through its vendors or suppliers) may limit the acceptance of orders to particular jurisdictions and as permitted by applicable law.</p>
							<p>Product Registration &amp; Technical Support. Chrysler may allow customers to register their products online through similar ways. Personal Information or data provided for such purposes may be used to carry out the request, service, or agreement for which the information is submitted. With your consent, we may also use the information you provide in online registration forms to notify you periodically about important changes to the Website or Application (such as a change to this Privacy Policy or notice of a security breach), new Chrysler products and services, and special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. If you register, we may ask for, among other things, your name, address, email, telephone number, type of product purchased, or other product-identifying information.</p>
							<p>Failure to register any Chrysler product will not diminish the rights you have under the applicable product warranty.</p>
							<p>Online Promotions, Contests and Sweepstakes. You may be asked to provide an email address or screen name, or other Personal Information, for entry into a particular promotion, including sweepstakes and contests, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. The specific rules and regulations governing the particular promotion, contest or sweepstakes will vary and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those rules and regulations.</p>
							<p>Certain promotions, contests or sweepstakes may be run by a Chrysler service provider or vendor or co-branded with one of our partners. In these instances the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the service provider or vendor or a third-party partner on their website. The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such information if they should differ from this Privacy Policy.</p>							
							
							<h2>NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION, COOKIES, AND RELATED INFORMATION COLLECTION</h2>
							<p>Cookies and Related Technologies. Cookies are small lines of text/data that are written onto your computer by a website. Chrysler or others acting on our behalf may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other similar technologies in connection with the operation of our Websites or Applications. These technologies may collect and store non-Personal Information in order to facilitate your use of Chrysler Websites or Applications. We utilize these technologies to research and understand how our Websites and Applications are used, to develop our products and services, to personalize your online experience with Chrysler both on our Websites and Applications and for advertising and other marketing purposes. At the end of your visit, session cookies used by Chrysler are removed. In some instances some Chrysler cookies may persist. For example, where we require registration in order to customize your experience such as in order to recognize your computer from a prior visit or enable you to log-in without having to enter your password. Cookies placed by Chrysler or its vendors or suppliers (as applicable) in connection with the operation of the Website or Application may remain stored on your computer until you remove them.</p>
							<p>Our service providers or vendors may also use cookies and related technologies in order to personalize your experiences and adapt a particular Chrysler Website or Application’s functionality to your preferences and for purposes such as those listed above. If you are visiting a URL other than Chrysler.com or other Chrysler Websites or Applications, including those hosted by our vendors or partners, you should carefully review the privacy policy of these websites. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to refuse receiving it. You should be aware that this may interfere with or make you unable to use certain functionality on websites using cookies. For example, many websites will ask your permission to use a cookie that will enable you to automatically log onto the website. Disabling or removing cookies may require you to manually log on each time you wish to visit that website.</p>
							<p>Children. Chrysler Websites or Applications are not directed at children. If you are under 18 or otherwise would be required to have parent or guardian consent to share information with Chrysler, you should not send any information about yourself to us. If a person under 13 submits information through any part of a Chrysler Website or Application, and we learn the person submitting the information is a child, we will attempt to delete this information as soon as possible. Because we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from persons under 13, we do not use or disclose such information to third parties.</p>
							
							<h2>WHEN CHRYSLER MAY SHARE COLLECTED INFORMATION</h2>
							<p>As mentioned in the beginning of this policy, Chrysler may share your Personal Information within Chrysler to fulfill its obligations to you and operate its business consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection law. We may also share your Personal Information with third parties in the following situations:</p>
							<p>Chrysler Affiliates, Vendors and Suppliers. Chrysler works with many affiliated third parties, vendors and suppliers. Affiliated third parties are companies that are part of the Chrysler Group LLC group of companies, Chrysler Group LLC dealers. Vendors and suppliers are companies who perform services for Chrysler Group LLC or its dealers. To the extent it is necessary for these groups to provide their products and services to us and provide products and services you have requested, these third parties may have access to or process your Personal Information. Chrysler may sometimes permit our authorized service providers to have access to aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Website or Application information. These transfers of aggregate statistics do not involve Personal Information or data.</p>
							<p>Recruitment and Job Applications. Residents of the United States may provide us with Personal Information through our Websites or Applications. Personal information such as that contained on a resume or curriculum vitae may be submitted in connection with a job application or inquiry. We may use this information throughout Chrysler (worldwide) for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry. We may keep your information on file for future consideration.</p>
							<p>Enabling Services. Chrysler offers a variety of services and functions through its Websites and Applications (“Chrysler Services”). Personal Information that is collected through a Website or Application may be used and/or disclosed to third parties in order to enable us to provide Chrysler Services. For example, some Chrysler Websites and Applications allow you to interface with third party websites or applications. To facilitate that connection, we may use your Personal Information and/or disclose your Personal Information to third parties. When we provide location-based services enabled through a third party, we may share data with those services in order to provide the related location-based service or functionality.</p>
							<p>Public Areas. Any information disclosed in public areas of a Chrysler Website or Application or other website (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.) will become public information. We cannot control the use of information disclosed in public forums, such as forums, bulletin boards, blogs, chat rooms, and networking functions of mobile-device applications. You should exercise caution when disclosing information in these public areas, especially your Location-Data, and be careful how you disclose your Personal Information. Content posted in public areas of Chrysler Websites or Applications, including advice and opinions, represent the views and is the responsibility of those who post the content. Chrysler does not necessarily endorse, support, verify, or agree with the content posted. If you have any questions or comments about any content on a Chrysler Website or Application please send us an email: <a href="mailto:dprivacy@chrysler.com">dprivacy@chrysler.com</a>.</p>
							<p>Mergers, Acquisitions, and Insolvency. If Chrysler should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if Chrysler should decide to buy, sell, or reorganize some part or all of its business, Chrysler may be required to disclose your Personal Information to prospective or actual purchasers in connection with one of these transactions</p>
							<p>As Required by Law and Other Extraordinary Disclosures. Chrysler may be required to disclose your Personal Information if it: (i) believes it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority, (ii) would potentially mitigate our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit, (iii) is otherwise necessary to protect our rights or property, or (iv) is necessary to protect the legal rights or property of others.</p>
							
							<h2>SECURITY</h2>
							<p>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. We use secure server software (SSL) and firewalls to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.</p>
							<p>If Chrysler learns of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this Website or Application or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of this Website or Application. Chrysler may post a notice on this Website or Application if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser or mobile device enabling you to view the Chrysler Website or Application. Chrysler may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at <a href="mailto:dprivacy@chrysler.com">dprivacy@chrysler.com</a>.</p>

We encourage you to read the privacy policies for these other websites, as they may differ from ours. This Website or Application also contains links to co-branded websites that may display Chrysler’s logo and trademarks but which are maintained by third parties. Such websites may be identified by the fact that they do not display a “Chrysler.com” URL. Please read the privacy policy on the co-branded website for the applicable privacy practices relating to personal information collected via that website, as it may differ from this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies solely to Personal Information collected by Chrysler on its Websites or Applications.</p>

Privacy laws differ across the globe. To help visitors whose native language may not be English understand our privacy practices, we may provide special information on our Privacy Policies that may be applicable to these visitors in different languages. Chrysler entities outside the United States may have supplemental privacy policies that may apply in those countries.</p>
							<p>If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, including those whose privacy laws may be more strict than U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States to Chrysler. By providing your personal data you consent to that transfer.</p>

							<p>You may restrict Chrysler’s use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. You may also request access to, correction of, or deletion of personal data.

							<p>Please be aware that this Privacy Policy and the choices that you indicate when registering on this Website or Application will not necessarily apply to Personal Information you may have provided to Chrysler or its vendors or business partners as part of other, separately-operated websites or services.</p>
