<br>This policy describes how we and other companies in the Fiat Group (collectively referred to as "we") intend to use your personal information.

<br>A cookie is a small amount of data, often including a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone browser from a website and is stored on the hard drive of your computer.

Users can set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is received, or to not receive any cookies at all. The latter means that some features cannot be provided you may not be able to enjoy the full website experience.<br><br>When you visit a Fiat Group Automobiles UK website, the pages you see are downloaded to your device along with a cookie. Many websites do this to understand whether the device (and therefore probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done by checking to see it can find the cookie left there on the previous visit.<br>Each internet browser works differently, so check the "Help" menu to find out how to change your cookie preferences.<br><br>Information gathered by cookies helps us to analyse our website visitors and provide you with a better user experience.<br>In addition, Fiat uses an independent research company, Psyma. They gather user feedback via an online survey including cookies, which is embedded on our website. We use this type of information to help improve the services we provide to our users.<br><br>In some areas of the Fiat.co.uk website we may embed photos and video content from websites such as YouTube and Flickr. Therefore when you visit a page with content embedded, you may be presented with cookies from these websites.&nbsp; FGAUK does not control the distribution of these cookies.&nbsp; You will need to check the relevant third party website for more information.<br><br>A list of the main cookies that the FGAUK websites set (and what each is used for) together with ways to minimise the number of cookies you receive, can be found in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies section</span>.<br><br><br><h4>Monitoring</h4>
<br>To make sure we follow your instructions correctly and to improve our service to you through training of our staff, we may monitor or record telephone calls between us.<br><br>Last updated: [17 Jan 2012].<p></p></div></div>
