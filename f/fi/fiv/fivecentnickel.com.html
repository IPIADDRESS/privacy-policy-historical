</ul>

<ul>

<li><strong>MINORS</strong></li>
<li><strong>HOW WE USE THE COLLECTED INFORMATION?</strong></li>

<h2>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</h2>
<p>We collect two types of information from our Users:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Information&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The first type of information is information that identifies or may reasonably identify an individual reasonable effort (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”). Personal Information which is being gathered may consist of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contact details</strong>: you may voluntarily provide us with certain contact details, such as your full name and email address.</li>
<li><strong>Voluntary information</strong>: We also collect information which you provide us voluntarily. For example, when you respond to communications from us, communicate with us via email or share additional information about yourself through your use of the Services, such as on the chat feature and in games.</li>
<li><strong>Device information</strong>: we collect specific types of connection details and information with regard to your device, software or hardware that may identify you, such as: device’s unique identifiers (e.g. UDID, IMEI, MAC address), browser fingerprinting, IP address and geo-location data.</li>
<li><strong>Social networks</strong>: when you voluntarily decide to register through your social network account (such as your Facebook account), we will have access to basic information from your social network account, such as your name, birthdate, profile picture and friends’ list, as well as information you made publicly available on such account.</li>
<li>In addition, when using the Services, you may be able via your social network to “Invite a Friend” to use the Services. Should the person accept your invitation, we may obtain Personal Information from him/her such as: name, email address, phone number and date of birth. We will use the Personal Information for the purposes set out herein and disclose such information only to third parties as detailed in this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li><strong>Information we collect from third parties</strong>: We collect Personal Information from third party service providers, such as information about your credit history from credit agencies and other financial information which is relevant to the provision of the Services, as well as information which is gathered in order to verify your identity and prevent fraudulent or illegal activity.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Personal information</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The second type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a User(s), which may be made available or gathered via the User’s use of the Services (“<strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>”).</p>
<p>Non-Personal Information which is being collected consists of technical information and aggregated usage information, and may contain, among other things, the User’s operating system, type of browser, screen resolution, browser and keyboard language, the User’s ‘click-stream’ and activities on the Services, the period of time the User visited the Services and related time stamps, etc.</p>
<p><strong>For avoidance of doubt, any Non-Personal Information connected or linked to any Personal Information shall be deemed as Personal Information as long as such connection or linkage exists</strong>.</p>
<p>Types of Non-Personal Information we collect from or about you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical information</strong>: In order to enhance the functionality of the Services and to provide you with a better user experience, we collect technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware information (e.g. the type of browser and operating system your device uses, language preference, access time and the domain name of the website from which you linked to the Services; etc.). This information also includes anonymous online identifiers, such as the Google Advertising ID and the IDFA.</li>
<li><strong>Device and app information</strong>– this category includes your device’s type and model, system language, the device’s operating system (such as Android or iOS), SDK version, mobile carrier name, mobile browsers installed on the device (such as Chrome or Safari), app history and usage information (such as information about running and installed apps on the device), information regarding downloads and installations of mobile applications and any information regarding in-app events (such as in-app purchases), and anonymous identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Google Advertising ID, or other types of device identifiers.</li>
<li><strong>Location information</strong>– we collect information about your general location (such as city and country). For example, we may use the IP address to identify your general location. This information does not tell us where your device is precisely located. This information is sent as a normal part of internet traffic. In addition, we also collect implicit location information, which allows us to infer that you are either interested in a place or that you might be at the place – this information does not actually tell us where your device is precisely located.</li>
<li><strong>Ad information</strong>– this category includes information about the online ads and personalized content we have served (or attempted to serve) to you. It includes things like how many times an ad has been served to you, what page the ad appeared on, whether you viewed, clicked on or otherwise interacted with the ad, ad engagement history and whether you visited the advertiser’s website, downloaded an app or purchased the product or service advertised.</li>
<li><strong>Log and analytics information</strong>: we collect information about your use of the Services, such as applications’ usage, log files, user activity (e.g. referral URL, pages viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, online browsing, clicks, actions, etc.), time stamps, alerts, etc. This information is collected for amongst other things troubleshooting errors and bugs as well as for research and analytics purposes about your use of the Services.</li>
<li><strong>Other anonymous information</strong>: We may anonymize or de-identify the information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information cannot, on its own, personally identify you. Our use and disclosure of such aggregated or de-identified information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation and for any purpose, such as for advertising or marketing purposes.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>MINORS</h2>
<p>The Services are not designed or directed to persons under the age of 18 or persons under the age of legal consent with respect to the use of the Services of any jurisdiction, whichever is higher (“Legally of Age”). If you are not Legally of Age, you should not download or use the Services nor provide any Personal Information to us.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to access and verify any Personal Information collected from you.
