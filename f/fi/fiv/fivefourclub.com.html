      	        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <div id="page_content">
        <p align="center"><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Five Four Club knows you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we'll do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting Five Four Club, you're accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice. You can browse our site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in North America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CUSTOMERS DOES FIVE FOUR CLUB GATHER?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your membership experience at Five Four Club. Here are the types of information we gather.</p>
<ul>
<li>Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you, but we respect your privacy when we market our products and services.</li>
<li>Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Five Four Club.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain information, although convenient for identification, is voluntary. It is up to you whether you want to provide this or other suitable identification, subject to any legal requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We collect, use and disclose personal information only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances, as well as non-personally identifying information (such as behavior statistics) in the aggregate in the context of site usage trends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. HOW DOES FIVE FOUR CLUB HANDLE COOKIES?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies are small files that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser, to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features you as the member enjoy, and storage of items in your information between visits.</li>
<li>The "help" section of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Five Four Club’s essential features, we recommend you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to checkout, or use any Five Four Club products and services that require you to sign in.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. DOES FIVE FOUR CLUB SHARE THE INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we're not in the business of selling it to any third party company for any reason. We share customer information only as described below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf but, we do not sell to third parties any Personal Information. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</li>
<li>Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that FiveFour Group, LLC or Five Four Club or substantially any or all of the assets of FiveFour Group, LLC or Five Four Club are acquired, customer information of course will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
<li>Protection of Five Four Club and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Five Four Club, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit-risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.</li>
<li>With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you'll receive written notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you'll have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. HOW SECURE IS INFORMATION ABOUT ME?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you enter.</li>
<li>It's important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and your computer. Be sure to sign off when you've finished using a shared computer. Click here for more information on how to sign off.</li>
<li>As discussed above, you always can choose not to provide information, although it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of additional Five Four Club suite features.</li>
<li>You can add or update certain information on pages such as your personal account information, profile and measurements.</li>
<li>If you don't want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please email us so we can further assist you. (If you don't want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices still will govern your use of Five Four Club, and it's your responsibility to review them for changes.)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We keep the personal information we collect about you strictly confidential. Only authorized personnel have access to this personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. WHAT ABOUT THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISERS AND LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our site may include third-party advertising and links to other Web sites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party Web sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These third-party Web sites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our Web site directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party Web sites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"), including information about how to opt-out of their information collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. WHICH INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Five Four Club gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with Five Four Club for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. This list will change as our Web site evolves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. ARE CHILDREN ALLOWED TO USE FIVE FOUR CLUB?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're under 18, you may not use Five Four Club. Membership is restricted to members 18 years of age or older.<br>
If you choose to visit Five Four Club, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the United States of America. If you have any concern about privacy at Five Four Club, please contact us, and we'll try to resolve it.<br>
Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

We may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain parts of our Website for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.</p>
