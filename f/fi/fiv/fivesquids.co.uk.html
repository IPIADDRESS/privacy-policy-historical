<h2>Why do we need this information?</h2>

<p>We need this information to allow us to communicate with our users regarding current orders and provide users with services relating to this. The PayPal or Stripe data allows us to check the details of receipts and payments made by or to our users, and is necessary for us to calculate how much commission we earn and how much money we should pay to our members. We keep your messages because we sometimes need them to help resolve disputes between users and fivesquid, should they arise, in accordance with our ‘service guarantee’. This helps us to ensure the integrity of the platform; prevent fraud and misuse and; provide a secure and easy place for users to trade their skills. All of the above is vital to ensuring we offer a safe and high quality service to our users. Should we need to use your information for reasons other than those set out in this policy, your consent will be obtained beforehand.</p>

<h2>How long is user data retained for?</h2>

<p>fivesquid retains most user information for a minimum of six years as part of its obligation under UK tax and accountancy rules. After six years we will review and delete (anonymise) if appropriate. fivesquid has no legal requirement to retain message records. Records are retained to resolve queries and disputes between users for as long as necessary. Data may also be retained until no longer needed from closed accounts to prevent fraudulent or other illegal activity, resolve any ongoing disputes or collect outstanding fees.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How do we&nbsp;anonymise user data?</h2>

<p>When you as a user asks to have their account deleted, fivesquid will in certain cases choose to anonymise&nbsp;some of your data and delete the rest. For example if you are a buyer and you have left feedback on a seller,&nbsp;this data is important to that seller - it impacts on their earnings and customer experience on the site. In such&nbsp;instances fivesquid will anonymise the feedback so it cannot be linked&nbsp;to or identify you. The data that we will&nbsp;anonymise includes: username, email, full name, IP address. The following data will always be deleted: your&nbsp;description, profession, profile pictures, city, country, favourite services, favourite sellers and any services.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How do we collect user information?</h2>

<p>The majority of information is collected directly by our users voluntarily providing the information on the site, through registration forms, posting services / requests, messaging users and providing any ad hoc voluntary information on the site. Behavioural and technical user data is automatically collected through our systems - an example of this is the use of Cookies (please see below).</p>

<h2>Data shared with Third Parties</h2>
