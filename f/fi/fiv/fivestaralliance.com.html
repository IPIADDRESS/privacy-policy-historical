            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p> Five Star Alliance takes your privacy very seriously, and we 
                appreciate the fact that by using our service you are placing a 
                great deal of trust in us. Our service has been built from the 
                ground up with your privacy foremost in mind. We know that 
                privacy is an important issue for our clients, and it is thus 
                an important issue for us. We make it our highest priority to 
                secure and protect the confidentiality of the personally 
                identifiable information that you provide to us.</p>
            <p> This policy clearly explains the type of personal information 
                we gather when you use the Five Star Alliance service. This 
                policy also outlines the steps we have taken to safeguard the 
                data we collect, and it explains the control we provide to you 
                over the data we collect.</p>
            <h3>Information we collect</h3>
            <p> The only personally identifiable information we collect is 
                information that you voluntarily provide to us. This includes 
                your email address and optional demographic information (such 
                as zip code, gender and year of birth), collected when you sign 
                up for our newsletter, and the information you provide to us 
                when you book a hotel reservation. Booking information, 
                required by hotels, includes name, address, contact 
                information, and the credit card details used to hold a 
                reservation. </p>
            <h3>How we use the information we collect</h3>
            <p> We use your information only for the explicit purposes for 
                which you provide it. When you sign up for our newsletter, we 
                use your email address for the purpose of delivering the 
                newsletter to you. We do not share your email address or your 
                optional demographic data with any other party, unless you 
                explicitly allow us to do so. We consider an explicit agreement 
                to be a clear "opt-in" choice-a choice that requires you to 
                take an action. We do not consider a box checked by default to 
                be an explicit agreement.</p>
            <p> When you book a hotel reservation with us, we deliver your 
                information directly to the relevant hotel, and not to any 
                other party. We store a copy of your booking information on our 
                computers so that you can retrieve that information when you 
                return to our site. However, for security purposes, we do not 
                store your entire credit card number on our servers. Instead, 
                we only store only the last four digits of the number.</p>
            <h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>
            <p> We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable 
                information as required by law and when we believe that 
                disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply 
                with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process 
                served on our Web site.</p>
            <h3>How we protect your information</h3>
            <div class="why-book-img">
                <script src="https://seal.verisign.com/getseal?host_name=www.fivestaralliance.com&amp;size=S&amp;use_flash=NO&amp;use_transparent=YES&amp;lang=en" type="text/javascript">

            </div>
            <p> Five Star Alliance uses the leading security technology 
                available to protect and secure your information. We are 
                certified by the industry-leading Verisign. For more 
                information on our security certification, please click the

            <h3>How we use cookies</h3>
            <p> A cookie is a small tag this is sent to your computer by your 
                web browser when you visit web sites. Upon your first visit to 
                Five Star Alliance, a cookie is sent to your computer. This 
                cookie contains no personally identifiable information. It is 
                used simply to improve your experience on our web site. For 
                example, the cookie may be used to store information you 
                provide when you search for hotels (which might include 
                location, activities, and/or dates) so that you don't have to 
                re-enter that same information for new searches. It is also 
                used to improve our service by helping us gauge our 
                effectiveness in helping you find and book the ideal luxury 
                hotel. </p>
            <p> The cookie on your computer is not connected to any personally 
                identifiable information. No other web sites can access the 
                information stored in this cookie. If you would like to refuse 
                cookies, you can do so by changing your browsers settings. 
                However some of our site features may not function properly.</p>
            <p> We also use a third-party tracking service called ClickTracks 
                that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable 
                information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. The 
                information collected by this cookie includes pages visited and 
                IP addresses. It is not possible to connect this tracking 
                information with any personally identifiable information, and 
                no one other than Five Star Alliance has access to this data, 
                which is used to understand how visitors interact with our 
                site, and to improve the quality of our service.</p>
            <h3>How we share information</h3>
            <p> The information you provide to us when you book a hotel 
                reservation is delivered directly to the relevant hotel, and is 
                not shared with any other party. This information includes your 
                name, address, contact information, and credit card details.</p>
            <p> The information you provide when you sign up for our 
                newsletter, including email address and optional demographic 
                information (such as zip code, gender, and year of birth), is 
                not shared with other parties unless you explicitly allow us to 
                do so. All explicit agreements will be "opt-in", rather than 
                "opt-out". This means that by default we will not share your 
                information, unless you take an action that allows us to do so. 
                </p>
            <h3>Updating your information</h3>
            <p> We strive to give you full control over the information you 
                provide to us. To unsubscribe from our newsletter, we provide 
                clear instructions on our web site (via the newsletter link 
                found on every page) and at the bottom of all emails delivered 
                to you.</p>
            <p> Due to the nature of the hotel industry's Global Distribution 
                System (GDS), it is not currently feasible to automatically 
                update the details of a reservation over our web site. Thus, 
                should you need to make an update to your booking information, 
                we ask that you <a href="/luxury_hotel_experts/contact_us.html">contact us</a>. We 
                will be happy to assist you. You may reach us by phone at (703) 
                836-0692, and links to our <a href="/luxury_hotel_experts/contact_us.html">our contact 
                information</a>, are provided on every page of our site.</p>
            <h3>Changes to this policy</h3>
            <p> This privacy policy is subject to change at any time. We expect 
                most changes to be minor, however from time to time significant 
                changes in this policy may occur. Changes will be published 
                here at this location. In the event of a transfer of ownership 
                of Five Star Alliance, LLC, we will provide notice before any 
                personally identifiable information is transferred or becomes 
                subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
