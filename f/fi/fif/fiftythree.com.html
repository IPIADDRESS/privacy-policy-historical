<p>FiftyThree, Inc. (“FiftyThree,” or “we”) wants you to be familiar with the type of information we collect from you, and how we use it. Through this Privacy Policy, we describe the information we collect on FiftyThree.com (the “Site”), through our downloadable Paper application (“Paper” or “App”). The App and Site also interact with our hardware “Pencil” stylus in a way that may transmit information. When we refer to our “Services,” we mean any combination of our App, Site, Pencil, customer service system, or any other tool, interface, or functionality related to any or all of the above. By using the Services, you agree that you are accepting the practices that we have outlined in this Policy, and that you consent to having your data transferred to and/or processed in the United States, where our facilities are&nbsp;located.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect through the Services, how we may use that information and with whom we may share it. This Privacy Policy is organized according to the sections&nbsp;below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information We&nbsp;Obtain</li>
<li>How We Use the Information We&nbsp;Obtain</li>
<li>Sharing of&nbsp;Information</li>
<li>Your&nbsp;Choices</li>
<li>Policy to California&nbsp;Customers</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Updates To Our Privacy&nbsp;Policy</li>
<li>How To Contact&nbsp;Us</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="information-we-obtain">Information We&nbsp;Obtain</h2>
<p>There are three ways in which we may obtain personally identifying information from you: you may submit it; we collect it automatically through our site; or we collect it automatically through Paper and other tools. Different types of information may be collected on each channel, and you should understand both how we do this and what types of information we collect on each&nbsp;channel.</p>
<h2 id="information-you-submit">Information You&nbsp;Submit</h2>
<p>You may choose to provide us with personal information through the Services, such as through forms, account portals, interfaces and interactions with other customer support portals and&nbsp;channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact information, such as your name and email&nbsp;address.</li>
<li>Other information about yourself, such as your age, gender, location, date of birth, language preference or&nbsp;interests.</li>
<li>Your&nbsp;photograph.</li>
<li>Information related or connected to a social media account that you use to sign up or log in to the Services, or when you associate that account with our Services. For instance, when you associate your Facebook account with our Services, we may receive your public profile (name, profile picture, age range, gender, language, country and other public information), your friend list and your email address. If you sign up, log in with or associate other social media accounts with our Services, such as Twitter or Tumblr, we may obtain similar information from those&nbsp;platforms.</li>
<li>You may also submit original content to us, which is covered under licenses set forth in our Terms of Use, describing other rights that you grant to us and other&nbsp;users.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="information-we-collect-by-automated-means-on-our-site">Information We Collect by Automated Means On Our&nbsp;Site</h2>
<p>We also may collect certain information from you by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, Web server logs, Web beacons and&nbsp;JavaScript.</p>
<p>Cookies are files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings on your device. Our Site may use <span class="caps">HTTP</span> cookies, <span class="caps">HTML5</span> cookies and other types of local storage (such as browser-based or plugin-based local storage). Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Site or other websites and online&nbsp;services.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the gathering of information through cookies, our Web servers may log information such as your device type, operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. The Web server logs also may record information such as the address of the Web page that referred you to our Site and the <span class="caps">IP</span> address of the device you use to connect to the Services. They also may log information about your interaction with this Site, such as which pages you visit. To control which Web servers collect information by automated means, we may place tags on our Web pages called “Web beacons,” which are small files that link Web pages to particular Web servers and their cookies. We also may send instructions to your device using JavaScript or other computer languages to gather the sorts of information described above and other details your interactions with the&nbsp;Site.</p>
<p>We may use third-party Web analytics Services on our Site, such as those of Google Analytics. These services providers use the technology described above to help us analyze how users use the Site. The information collected by the technology (including your <span class="caps">IP</span> address) will be disclosed to or collected directly by these services providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Site. To learn about opting out of Google Analytics, please <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">click&nbsp;here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="information-we-collect-by-automated-means-with-paper-and-other-tools">Information We Collect by Automated Means With Paper and Other&nbsp;Tools</h2>
<p>If you use Paper, we may collect the following information by automated&nbsp;means:</p>
<ul>
<li>The type of device you use and its operating&nbsp;system.</li>
<li>Identification details of your device, such as any unique device identifier such as an <span class="caps">IDFA</span> (for iOS) or <span class="caps">MAC</span>&nbsp;address.</li>
<li><span class="caps">IP</span> address of your&nbsp;device.</li>
<li>Other information about your device, such as your device hardware model, operating system version, or mobile network&nbsp;information.</li>
<li>Information about your use of&nbsp;Paper.</li>
<li>Any data associated with and identifying the stylus or other hardware or tools you are using in connection with our Services, including how you use that stylus to interact with Paper and our Services. This might include, for instance, information about service usage, frequency of usage, content placed or accessed, and communications you make available through your use of the&nbsp;Services;</li>
<li>If we collect device-based, precise geo-location information, we will provide notice to you of that collection and our purpose for doing&nbsp;so.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-we-use-the-information-we-collect">How We Use the Information We&nbsp;Collect</h2>

<li>Processing, evaluating and responding to your requests, inquiries and&nbsp;applications.</li>
<li>Managing our customer information&nbsp;databases.</li>
<li>Administering contests, sweepstakes and&nbsp;surveys.</li>
<li>Customizing your experience with our&nbsp;Services.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="sharing-of-information">Sharing of&nbsp;Information</h2>
<p>We may share or allow you to share personal information as part of the Services. For example your user name and other account details may be associated with content and comments you post on or through the Services.
We may allow you to post information to your social network account if your settings allow for such sharing.   When you do this, Information you submit to a third-party widget or plugin on our Services, such as the Twitter widget in Paper, is collected directly by the provider of that widget or plugin and is not subject to our Privacy&nbsp;Policy.</p>
<p>We may share personal information we collect on the Services with certain Services providers, who provide customer or technical support, billing support, shipping and order fulfillment, marketing and email services, data support and services, and other operational services that help us offer our own Services to&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities; or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical, financial or other harm, injury or loss; or (iv) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity. We also may disclose aggregated or non-identifiable information to third parties in a manner that does not identify particular&nbsp;users.</p>
<p>If we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation), then the information we have collected from you will likely be part of that transfer, as&nbsp;well.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Your&nbsp;Choices</strong></p>
<p> Where applicable, you may amend your preferences regarding how we communicate with you by updating your profile or settings within your Paper account or contacting us as described in the How to Contact Us section below. You also may use certain settings features Paper to modify certain preferences regarding the sharing functionality of the app. You may unsubscribe from marketing-oriented emails by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in those&nbsp;emails.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Shopify</strong></p>
<p> Our “store” is hosted on servers operated and hosted by Shopify, Inc. Shopify provides us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell certain of our products and services to you, such as certain hard goods we offer.

</li>
<li><p><strong>Security</strong></p>
