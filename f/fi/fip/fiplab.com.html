		<br>
		<h3>OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
		<hr size="1">
<p>FIPLAB Ltd is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should we ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using this website or our applications and services, then you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.</p>
<p>FIPLAB Ltd may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes. This policy is effective from 22nd August 2011.</p>

<h4>What we collect</h4>

<p>We may collect the following information:</p>
<p>- name (if you provide it to us)<br>
- contact email address (should you decide to sign up for your newsletter or setup a NotesTab cloud syncing account)<br>
- computer IP address<br>
- other information relevant to our applications such as <b>anonymous</b> usage statistics<br>
- data you provide in the use of our applications and services (e.g. if you use our NotesTab cloud syncing service, we will hold the note data you provide on our secure cloud servers)</p>

<h4>What we do with the information we gather</h4>

<p>We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:</p>
<p>- Internal record keeping<br>
- Improving our applications and services<br>
- Sending emails about our applications using the email address which you have provided (only if you have opted in to our newsletter)<br>
- Website and application anonymous usage/traffic monitoring<br>
- Application specific features such as user accounts for data syncing etc.<br>
- We may use the information to customise the website according to your interests.<br>
- We may disclose the data to trusted service providers whom we rely on for hosting, marketing and analytics solutions. In all such cases, we will ensure the service provider agrees to keep the data confidential. This is quite standard with all companies, so there is no cause for concern. For example, we have to store the data you provide to us to make the note cloud syncing service possible with hosting companies, such as Amazon Cloud. This is required for the cloud syncing to function. Also, if you CHOOSE to opt-in to our newsletter, then we'll have to hold your contact details with our mailing list provider, MailChimp.</p>

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>

<h4>Compliance with laws and law enforcement</h4>

<p>FIPLAB Ltd cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you and your data to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in order to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of FIPLAB Ltd or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.</p>
