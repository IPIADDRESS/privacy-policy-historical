     <h1>Financial Sense Website Privacy Statement</h1>
     
     <p class="text"><em>This document was last updated on 30 October 2009.</em></p>
     <p class="text"><strong>1. Acknowledgment and acceptance of terms</strong></p>
     <p class="text">Financial Sense® and its parent company, Puplava Financial  Services, Inc. (collectively, "FSO/PFS"), are committed to protecting  your privacy.

       <p class="text"><strong>b. Use of Cookies</strong></p>
       <p class="text">FSO/PFS may use cookies to  personalize or enhance your user experience. </p>
       <p class="text">A cookie is a small text file that  is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run  programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to  you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain that issued the cookie  to you. </p>
       <p class="text">One of the primary purposes of  cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if  you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site  to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this  simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation  by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing  personalized functionality. </p>
       <p class="text">You have the ability to accept or  decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can  usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies  by changing your browser settings then be aware that this may disable some of  the functionality on our Websites.</p>
       <p class="text">FSO/PFS reserves the right to  share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but, with the below  exceptions, does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website  unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging into the  Websites a site that relies on third-party cookies).</p>
       <p class="text"><strong>b.1. GoogleAd Cookies</strong></p>
       <p class="text">Google™, as a third party vendor,  uses cookies to serve ads on the Websites. Google's use of the DART cookie  enables it to serve ads to FSO users based on their visits to the FSO site and  other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by  visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_cookies.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> for Google Ads and the Google content network.</p>
       <p class="text"><strong>b.2. Other Advertiser/Aggregator Cookies</strong></p>
       <p class="text">FSO's advertiser, aggregator, or  affiliate relationships may involve the use of cookies to track relationships  that originate with FSO. </p>
       <ol>
         <li class="text"><strong>Personal Information Users</strong></li>
       </ol>
       <p class="text">You may be asked to disclose  personal information to us so that we can provide assistance and information to  you. For example, such data may be warranted in order to provide online  technical support and troubleshooting, or to respond to comments on the  Websites' content or features.</p>
       <p class="text">Visitors to our website can also  register to contribute content ("Contributors"). When you register,  we will request some personal information such as name, address, email,  telephone number or facsimile number, credentials, and other relevant  information. At the time of registration, Contributors will determine how much  of their contact information they would like to be visible to the Websites'  visitors. FSO/PFS assumes no liability for any Contributor's decision to make  certain personal information public. Although we encourage Contributors to use  their real names, this public information may include an "alias"  rather than a contributor's real name. Regardless of what contact or personal  information a Contributor chooses to make public, or whether or not a  Contributor chooses to use an alias, FSO/PFS must be provided with accurate and  up-to-date contact information, which may include, but is not limited to, the  Contributor's real name, legal address, phone number, and email address. </p>
       <p class="text">Visitors and Contributors should  be aware that communications received by PFS/FSO that are directed to a specific  Contributor will be forwarded to that contributor by PFS/FSO.</p>
       <p class="text">After your initial contact with  us, your personal information (name, address, phone number, email address,  etc.) will be kept on file indefinitely in order to maintain records of our  relationship with our contributors and visitors.</p>
       <p class="text"><strong>c.1. Protection of Personal Information Collected</strong></p>
       <p class="text">We will not disclose personally  identifiable information we collect from you to third parties without your  permission except to the extent necessary including:</p>
       <ul>
         <li class="text">To fulfill your service requests for services,</li>
         <li class="text">To protect ourselves from liability,</li>
         <li class="text">To respond to legal process or comply with law, </li>
         <li class="text">To enforce and investigate possible violations  of our Websites' policies, including Contribution Guidelines and  <a href="http://www.financialsense.com/aboutus/termsofuse.html">Terms of Use</a>, </li>
         <li class="text">To investigate, protect against, and prevent  technical issues, security issues, and/or fraud, or</li>
         <li class="text">In connection with a merger, acquisition, or  liquidation of the company.</li>
       </ul>
       <p class="text">However, trusted third parties who  assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you,  may, in the course of their relationship with FSO/PFS, have some degree of  access to this information; all such parties agree to keep this information  confidential, and to not use it for their own business purposes.</p>
       <p class="text">We also implement a variety of  security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you  access your personal information. </p>
       <p class="text">We offer the use of a secure  server. All supplied sensitive personal information is transmitted via Secure  Socket Layer (SSL) technology. </p>
       <p class="text">Non-public and public information  collected on Contributors is inputted into our Database, and is only accessed  by those authorized to view this information; we are required to keep the  information confidential. Non-public information collected on Contributors is  only shared with FSO/PFS staff as needed, and is not released to the public.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p class="text"><strong>4. Use of Web Beacons or GIF files</strong></p>
     <p class="text"> FSO Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web  beacons—sometimes also called single-pixel gifs—that allow FSO to count users  who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. </p>
     <p class="text">Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party  service providers to help determine the effectiveness of their advertising  campaigns or email communications. These Web beacons may be used by these  service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows  the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain  pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page  views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which  advertisements and emails bring you to our website and how you use the site. FSO  prohibits Web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.</p>
     <p class="text"><strong>5. Accessing/Updating Web Account Information  (for Contributors)</strong></p>
     <p class="text"> Contributors who wish to update their contact information  with FSO/PFS may do so by contacting the Websites' <a href="http://www.financialsense.com/contactus/contact.htm">webmaster</a> directly.  FSO/PFS reserves the right to review and approve  any updates to Contributor information before posting it to the Websites, and  to refuse and/or deny to update information that does not comply with the terms  of its <a href="http://www.financialsense.com/aboutus/privacy.html">Privacy Statement</a> or Terms of Use Statement&gt;.</p>
     <p class="text"><strong>6.California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></p>
     <p class="text">  Because we value your privacy we have taken the necessary  precautions to be in compliance with the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&amp;group=22001-23000&amp;file=22575-22579" target="_blank">California Online Privacy Protection  Act</a>. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside  parties without your consent or unless required by law.</p>
     <p class="text"><strong>7. Children's Online Privacy  Protection Act</strong></p>
     <p class="text">     We are in compliance with the requirements of <a href="http://www.coppa.org/" target="_blank">COPPA</a>  (Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act); we do not collect any personally  identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our website,  products and services are all directed toward people who are at least 18 years  old or older.</p>
     <p class="text"><strong>8. Terms of Use</strong></p>
