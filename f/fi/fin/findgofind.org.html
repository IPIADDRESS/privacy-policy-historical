<p> FindGoFind PRIVACY POLICY </p>
<p>MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME</p>
<p>PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES</p>
<p>Effective as of November 3, 2015</p>

<p>
    FindGoFind has established this Privacy Policy to disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices for the FindGoFind Application and our Services, and to allow you to make an informed decision about how you will use our Services.  Our "Services" include the FindGoFind Application, and all related services, applications, components, programs, software, listings, directories, tools, updates, databases and information made available and utilized. References to "you" in this Agreement means you, your duly authorized representatives and any entity you may represent in connection with your use of the Services.
</p>

<p>
    By using our Services, you are consenting to the terms of this Privacy Policy and all of the activities described herein. If you do not agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, you should uninstall FindGoFind and not use our Services. We reserve the right to enter into new or different lines of business with consumers and if and to the extent we do, we may display a different privacy policy to the consumer for such lines of business.
</p>

<p>
    This Privacy Policy addresses only our practices with respect to information we collect in the course of using our Services and does not apply to information about you that might be collected by a third party website or an offering linked to or otherwise accessible from our Services. Any information collected, obtained and/or used by any such third parties is subject to the privacy policies of those third parties. We encourage you to review the policies of such third parties. Finally, to the extent any of our Services are undertaken in conjunction with or as a co-branded service with a third party, then both our Privacy Policy and such third party's privacy policy may apply.
</p>

<h3>Collection of Information and Your Privacy Rights</h3>
<h3>What information we collect and how we collect it.</h3>

<p>1.             Collection of Information</p>
<p>
    (a) FindGoFind does not, generally, collect, track or maintain personally identifiable information about consumers that use our Services. However, we may collect personally-identifiable information through the use of our Services upon your contacting us so that we may respond to your questions or comments, such as your name, email or mailing address, or other information you include when contacting us. 
</p>
<p>
    (b) We also may collect and store URLS that you visit. 
</p>
<p>
    (c) When you use or interact with our Services, we may also collect certain anonymous information that is not sufficient to permit someone to identify you by name, mailing address, telephone number, social security number, driver's license or other government-issued identification. The anonymous information we may have access to, obtain, retain and use may include:
    </p><ul>
        <li>Information about your use of our Services, such as the frequency with which you use them, how you use and interact with them, when you visit them, and your responses to the offerings and advertisements made available to you through them, among other things; and</li>
        <li>
            Information that may be gathered or received when you use the Services or visit other websites, including, without limitation, the following:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The type of browser you are using when using our Services, including your browser's "user agent" (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, and other browsers);
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your operating system type, whether Mac OS, or Windows, and which version of Windows;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your Internet protocol (IP) address and information about the version of any software comprising a portion of the Services that you use;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your geographic location and the domain name of your Internet service provider (ISP); the URLs and websites that you visit and have visited; and/or Diagnostic information which describes how our Services are operating on your system.

            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
<p></p>

<p>
    (d) All of the foregoing information is collectively referred to hereinafter as "Anonymous Information." We may also supplement Anonymous Information with additional information from other third parties in some cases. Additionally, those portions of the Services comprised of software have been configured to communicate to us any information relating to computer errors arising from use of such software, without providing any notice to you of the delivery of such communications. Such communications may include the configuration settings applicable at the time of the error. We use this data to help us clarify and fix performance issues with and to improve the software and the Services.
</p>

<p>
    (e) In addition, as part of the functionality provided by our Service, FindGoFind assigns a unique user ID, which is stored in the computer registry.   This unique user ID is combined with the information collected via the Services in order to provide you a more customized search experience, and to clarify, fix and improve the software and the Services.
</p>

<p>2.         Use of Information</p>
<p>
    (a) Anonymous Information is used to (i) operate and improve upon the Services, including all constituent parts of the Services such as the software, the websites and the various offerings, among other things, (ii) research and analyze your use of the Services, and (iii) present you with offers for other products, offerings, programs, features and/or services that may be of interest to you.

    We will not share your Anonymous Information with third parties unless:
    </p><ul>
        <li>You have given us your prior consent to disclose such information;</li>
        <li>The third party is our parent, subsidiary, or an affiliated company owned by our parent company;</li>
        <li>We must disclose some or all of your Anonymous Information to authorized officers of the court in order to comply with valid legal process or to act in other urgent situations (as further discussed below); or</li>

We only share anonymized or aggregated information to improve the relevancy of the ads you see. As mentioned below in section 3, these third-party advertising networks and advertisers may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect and track non-personally identifiable information such as demographic information, aggregated information, and Internet activity to assist them in delivering advertising that is more relevant to your interests.</li>
    </ul>
<p></p>

<p>(b) We note above, but it is worth reiterating here, that your Anonymous Information and other information about you as a user of our Services, may be disclosed by us to those authorized officers of the court in response to valid legal process, including without limitation, a valid court order, search warrant or subpoena), as well as in other circumstances if we believe in good faith that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or another person or that the Services are being used in the commission of a crime by your or another third party. Furthermore, we may disclose your Anonymous Information to protect our own rights, Services and property or those of our affiliated providers, in addition to providing you with the Services.</p>

<p>
    (c) In the event that ownership of all or a portion of the Services currently provided by FindGoFind were to change as a result of a merger, acquisition or transfer to another company, your Anonymous Information may be transferred as well.

<p>6.         General Internet Hazards</p>
<p>
    Any time you receive files over the Internet from third parties, regardless of the application used, whether FindGoFind, email or other application, you may be subjecting yourself to receiving harmful files or files that are not compatible with your operating system. Prior to accepting any files from any Internet user, including those from an account that appears familiar to you, we highly recommend verifying that the person sending you such files is the person you believe he or she is. You should be extremely careful about accepting files from users you do not trust, from users you do not know, or from users whose identity you have not been able to confirm. You should also be aware that communications sent over the Internet are not secure unless they are encrypted. FindGoFind does not encrypt your communications through the Services. Further, your communications made through FindGoFind may be routed through different countries which may have different laws, rules, regulations and standards regarding activities on the Internet. As such, FindGoFind cannot accept any responsibility for any unauthorized access to your communications made through the Services or any loss of data.
