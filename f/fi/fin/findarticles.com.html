<ol>
<li><a name="q1"></a><strong>What information does FindArticles collect?</strong>

<p>At different times, FindArticles may collect several types of information about you.  Except as otherwise stated in this privacy policy, we do not provide this information to third parties, except in aggregate form.</p>

<p>First, we or our partners or advertisers may use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign identification to your computer. The unique user ID contained within your cookie automatically identifies your computer — but not you — to our servers every time you visit our site. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. You can turn the cookies feature off by using your browser's preference options, but you may not be able to utilize some services properly.</p>

<p>Second, we keep track of your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our site. Your IP address is a number that identifies a computer which accesses the Internet.  This address is used to gather broad demographic information about you, such as your Internet service provider and the geographic location of your IP address. FindArticles may also collect aggregate information on how our users are utilizing the site. This might include information regarding traffic patterns through the site and search queries.</p>

<p>Third, we log browser types, access times, URLs from which visitors came to our site and URLs viewed by visitors while on our site. Again, FindArticles uses this information on an aggregate basis, in this case making sure we can support overall visitor traffic and service performance.</p>

<p>Fourth, at specific times we may ask you to provide us with personal information in order for you to register for a service or to enter a sweepstakes. Also, you may also provide personal information if you write us feedback email.  This information may include but is not limited to your name and email address. You may always choose not to provide us with this information; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service, offer you personalized content, or respond to your feedback.</p>

<p>Fifth, we contract with 24/7 Real Media, a service partner, to provide us with a data collection and reporting service to better understand overall use of our site. 24/7 Real Media may store certain legacy data that we received from visitors to our site prior to our relationship with them, so that we may access this information via their reporting service. 24/7 Real Media may collect information on our behalf about our users' visiting behaviors in several ways, including through the use of cookies or pixel tags.  We use 24/7 Real Media to understand what's popular and useful for visitors.</p>
</li>

<li><a name="q2"></a>
<strong>What organization is collecting the information?</strong>

<p>FindArticles usually collects the requested information. However, FindArticles has chosen select partners in order to provide certain services. In order to use certain services on the site, it may be necessary to enter information that then goes to our partner and is not kept by FindArticles. The areas of our site in which partners are collecting information may be cobranded with our partners' logos.  If you have questions regarding the privacy policy or data collection practices of one of our content partners, please contact that partner directly.</p>

<p>We use third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to collect information and serve ads to you when you visit our site.  These companies may use cookies, pixel tags, or otherwise independently collect information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) from you and use this information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.  We do not control their collection and use of information. Please note that if an advertiser or advertising network asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or advertising network may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.</p>

<p>To learn more about the collection of information by these third party advertising networks, including how to opt out of such collection, see the links below.</p>

<strong>What does FindArticles do with the data it collects?</strong>

In all cases, personally identifiable information is not shared with our advertisers, except as otherwise stated in this privacy policy.</p>

<p>We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our site. It's the way we can make sure our service is available 24/7 to you.</p>

<p>If you register for a service or to enter a sweepstakes, we may use the information we collect to provide the service to you or send communications regarding the sweepstakes.  We may also send a newsletter by email to our users who opt to receive such emails.  It is our policy to send these emails only to users who give us permission to do so.

</li>

<li><a name="q4"></a>
<strong>With whom does FindArticles share data?</strong>

<p>We may disclose certain non-personally identifiable information about you to advertisers or other third parties in order to present you with targeted advertisements.  We may share aggregate demographic information with our advertisers or information collection companies, but will not reveal any personally identifiable information in these instances.</p>
</li>

<li><a name="q5"></a>
<strong>What choices are available regarding collection, use and distribution of the information (Opt Out Policy)?</strong>

<p>As previously noted, you may always choose to not provide us with any of the information we request; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service or limit our ability to offer personalized content.</p>

<p>To learn more about the collection of information by third party advertising networks, including how to opt out of such collection, see the links below.</p>

</li>

<li><a name="q7"></a>
<strong>How can I delete my information?</strong>

<p>FindArticles currently does not have a method for completely deleting user information from our database.

</li>

<li><a name="q8"></a>
<strong>What procedures have been designed to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under FindArticles's control?</strong>

<p>Except as otherwise stated in this privacy policy, FindArticles has taken measures to ensure that information that is not publicly available through its site is accessible only to the user who initially entered the information or to authorized personnel at FindArticles or its partners, and only after a password has been entered.  In the unlikely event of a security breach for which we provide notice under Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.82, LookSmart will send a notification to the email address on file (if any) for each relevant user informing him or her of the security breach.</p>

</li>

<li><a name="q9"></a>
<strong>What about privacy policies for sites to which FindArticles links?</strong>

<p>FindArticles contains many links to Web sites not controlled by FindArticles. These sites have their own policies and practices with respect to online privacy, and FindArticles cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these Web sites. In addition, in certain instances a FindArticles advertiser may ask you for personal information. FindArticles cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of its advertisers.</p>

</li>
</ol>
