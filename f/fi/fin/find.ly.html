<p>At Symphony Talent, LLC (“Symphony Talent”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), we recognize that privacy is important, and we are committed to provide a safe, secure experience to you, the user (“you,” “your” or “user”).</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices for the Symphony Talent websites; <a href="http://findly.com">symphonytalent.com</a>, <a href="http://hrapply.com">hrapply.com</a>, <a href="http://thehive.com">thehive.com</a>, hodes.com, <a href="http://skillcheck.com">skillcheck.com</a>, swarm.findly.com, <a href="https://go8.smartpost.com">https://go8.smartpost.com</a>, <a href="https://mediaoptimizer.hodes.com">https://mediaoptimizer.hodes.com</a> and waggle.findly.com (hereinafter collectively “Symphony Talent Sites” or “Sites”), as well as related products, offerings and services we may offer to you (collectively referred to as the “Services”). This Privacy Policy also covers how personal and other information that we receive or collect about you is treated. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. Please read the information below to learn more regarding your privacy and your use of the Symphony Talent Sites and Services.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is designed to be read in connection with the Sites’ Terms of Use, which are available at <a href="http://www.symphonytalent.com/tos/">http://www.symphonytalent.com/tos/</a> and that by accessing or using our Sites, whether as a Job Seeker or Recruiter, you explicitly accept the collection, use and transfer of your information as described in this Privacy Policy, and you agree to be bound by the Sites’ Terms of Use.</p>
<p>If you do not want your information to be collected, used, and transferred as described by this Privacy Policy, you may revoke your consent to our Privacy Policy by clicking <a href="http://www.findly.com/contact/">here</a> to contact us or by exiting the Site and not accessing the Services.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat your personal information by either placing a prominent notice on our Sites, and/or sending a notice to the primary email address you provided to us prior to the change becoming effective. We will also update our privacy information on this page. It is your responsibility to review any updates to our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Symphony Talent Sites and/or Services after any such modification to our Privacy Policy will constitute your acknowledgment of the modified Privacy Policy and your agreement to abide and be bound by the new Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The Symphony Talent Sites offer you a range of Services that require different types of information and information use, in order for you to use those Services. You should note as you read this Privacy Policy, that it is a single Privacy Policy for all different types of users and Symphony Talent Services we offer. As such, some of the information discussed herein may not appear to be relevant to the specific Services you wish to use. As an example, if you are a job seeker who is registering for job alert emails, the sections in this Privacy Policy relating to information such as a ‘Social Security Number’ are not relevant to you. We only collect, store and use information that is needed to provide the Services you choose to use.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us using the “Contact Us” form at: <a href="http://www.symphonytalent.com/contact/">http://www.symphonytalent.com/contact/</a> or by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@symphonytalent.com">privacy@symphonytalent.com</a></p>
<p>IMPORTANT: BY USING THE SYMPHONY TALENT SITES AND/OR SERVICES AVAILABLE ON THE SITES, YOU GIVE YOUR CONSENT THAT ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU SUBMIT MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE MANNER AND FOR THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE THE SITES OR ACCESS THE SERVICES.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Scope of this Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p>This Policy applies to information we collect on sites owned or controlled by Symphony Talent or its affiliated companies (hereinafter “Symphony Talent”). Affiliated companies are entities that control, are controlled by or are under common control with Symphony Talent.</p>
<p>If you are using our Sites to look or offer yourself for work, apply for a job, sign up for alerts or other services, participate in a job survey, take a skills assessment, complete a background check, or perform other career-related activities (a “Job Seeker”), we share your information with potential employers, headhunters, recruiters, hiring managers and other human resource professionals (collectively “Recruiter” or “Recruiters”). We are unable to control their use of your data. We also do not control the data practices of those who access your information on or through our Sites, or other third parties with whom we work with to provide Services that you may choose to use. &nbsp;You may wish to review the privacy policies of those sites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.</p>
<p>If you are using our Sites as a Recruiter, we do not control the data practices of third parties with whom we work with to provide Services that you may choose to use, nor parties that you may request we work with to integrate other services and systems you may use.</p>
<p>Some of our pages utilize framing techniques to serve content to/from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our Site. Please be aware that you are providing your personal information to these third parties and not to Symphony Talent Sites.</p>
<p>Information collected on our Sites is stored in the United States; therefore, your information is subject to U.S. law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Information We Collect</b></p>
<p>We collect three types of information when you use our Sites: Personal Information (“PI”), Company Information, and Aggregate Information.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that any and all materials you upload to the Symphony Talent Sites (“Submissions”), are subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><b><i>Personal Information: </i></b>This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this Site, such as registering, purchasing a product or service, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself.</p>
<p>When you use our Sites as a Job Seeker or as a Recruiter, you create a profile, which contains a core set of PI, which acts as a login authentication to identify you (a “Profile”). We store this Profile in the United States.</p>
<p>You use your Profile to access our Services, and you add, update and delete information on your Profile as you use the Services. The Services that you choose to use determines the type of information collected, the use of that information by Symphony Talent and by others, and your control over that information.</p>
<p>For example, your Profile will always contain:</p>
<ol>
<li>your name;</li>
<li>your email address; and</li>
<li>a password that you set.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, depending on the Services you use, we may collect and store in your Profile:</p>
<ol>
<li>contact information such as address, telephone number;</li>
<li>information about your education and occupation background, skills and experience, awards, memberships and affiliations, activities and interests;</li>
<li>information imported by you and/or your connections from third party sites;</li>
<li>information about third parties, such as references or contacts which you provide to us with the third parties’ express written consent to do so;</li>
<li>your resume, cover letters, patents, work examples and other documents (“Supporting Documents”);</li>
<li>your preferences and favorites; and/or</li>
<li>your age, gender, race or ethnicity, if permitted by local law and you choose to provide it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on the Services you choose to use, some or all of your Profile may be made available to other parties. Your Password is never shown to any other party.</p>
<p>We attempt to limit access to our Sites to Recruiters, but we do not and cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. Furthermore, we cannot control the use of information in your Profile by third parties who access the Sites. Once your Profile has been disclosed, Symphony Talent is not able to retrieve it from the third parties who have seen, downloaded, printed or otherwise stored it.</p>
<p>Some Services (such as background checks and various new hire on-boarding functions employers may require of you, or your purchasing of other Services we may offer you, etc.), may require that you provide very sensitive information (“Permitted Hidden Information”) such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Social Security Number or National Identification Number; and/or</li>
<li>Credit card number and billing information.</li>
</ol>
<p>Permitted Hidden Information is not stored in, and is not visible in, your Profile. Other than for storage as Permitted Hidden Information, you should not put Social Security Numbers, bank accounts, personality profiles, or other information you would not want made public, in your Profile, Public Submissions, or any Supporting Document.</p>
<p>Some Services allow you to set your Profile, parts of your Profile, your Supporting Documents and some types of Submissions that you make visible to the public areas of Symphony Talent Sites (“Public Submission”). Public Submissions can be seen by any user on the Symphony Talent Sites, and by any person on the Internet. You can retract Public Submissions at any time by adjusting your privacy settings in your profile. However, anyone who has viewed your Profile, including your Public Submissions, may have kept a copy of them.</p>
<p>You may delete your Profile (which deletes your Supporting Documents and Public Submissions), from our Sites at any time. Some Countries and States require that we, and/or Recruiters that use our Services, retain a copy of the information you provided. Deleting your Profile from our Sites does not guarantee that copies of your information are also being deleted.</p>
