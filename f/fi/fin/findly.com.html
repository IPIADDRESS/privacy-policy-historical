<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scope of this Policy</strong></p>
<p>This Policy applies to information we collect on sites owned or controlled by Findly Talent, LLC or its affiliated companies (hereinafter “Findly”). Affiliated companies are entities that control, are controlled by or are under common control with Findly.</p>
<p>If you are using our Sites to look or offer yourself for work, apply for a job, sign up for alerts or other services, participate in a job survey, take a skills assessment, complete a background check, or perform other career related activities (a “Job Seeker”), we share your information with employers, headhunters, recruiters, hiring managers and other human resource professionals (collectively “Recruiter” or “Recruiters”). We are unable to control their use of your data. We also do not control the data practices of those who access your information on or through our Sites, or other third parties with whom we work with to provide Services that you may choose to use.</p>
<p>If you are using our Sites as Recruiter, we do not control the data practices of third parties with whom we work with to provide Services that you may choose to use, nor parties that you may request we work with to integrate other services and systems you may use.</p>
<p>We link to other websites over which we have no control. Findly is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other websites. You may wish to review the privacy policies of those sites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.</p>
<p>Information collected on our Sites is stored in the United States; therefore, your information is subject to U.S. law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>We collect three types of information when you use our Sites: Personal Information (“PI”), Company Information, and Aggregate Information.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that any and all materials you upload to the Findly Sites (“Submissions”), are subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Personal Information: </em></strong>This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this Site, such as registering, purchasing a product or service, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself.</p>
<p>When you use our Sites as a Job Seeker or as a Recruiter, you create a profile, which contains a core set of PI, which acts as a login authentication to identify you (a “Profile”). We store this Profile in the United States.</p>
<p>You use your Profile to access our Services, and you add, update and delete information on your Profile as you use the Services. The Services that you choose to use determines the type of information collected, the use of that information by Findly and by others, and your control over that information.</p>
<p>For example, your Profile will always contain:</p>
<ol>
<li>your name;</li>
<li>your email address;</li>
<li>a password that you set.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, depending on the Services you use, we may collect and store in your Profile:</p>
<ol>
<li>contact information such as address, telephone number;</li>
<li>information about your education and occupation background, skills and experience, awards, memberships and affiliations, activities and interests;</li>
<li>information imported by you and/or your connections from third party sites;</li>
<li>information about third parties, such as references or contacts which you provide to us with the third parties’ express written consent to do so;</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>your resume, cover letters, patents, work examples and other documents (“Supporting Documents”)</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>your preferences and favorites;</li>
<li>your age, gender, race or ethnicity, if permitted by local law and you choose to provide it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on the Services you choose to use, some or all of your Profile may be made available to other parties. Your Password is never shown to any other party.</p>
<p>We attempt to limit access to our Sites to Recruiters, but we do not and cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. Furthermore, we cannot control the use of information in your Profile by third parties who access the Sites. Once your Profile has been disclosed, Findly is not able to retrieve it from the third parties who have seen, downloaded, printed or otherwise stored it.</p>
<p>Some Services (such as background checks and various new hire on-boarding functions, purchasing of Services, etc.), may require that you provide very sensitive information (“Permitted Hidden Information”) such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Social Security Number or National Identification Number;</li>
<li>Credit card number and billing information.</li>
</ol>
<p>Permitted Hidden Information is not stored in, and is not visible in your Profile.</p>
<p>Some Services allow you to set your Profile, parts of your Profile, your Supporting Documents and some types of Submissions that you make, visible to the public areas of Findly Sites (“Public Submission”). Public Submissions can be seen by any user on the Findly Sites, and by any person on the Internet. You can retract Public Submissions at any time. However, anyone who has viewed your Public Submissions may have kept a copy of them.</p>
<p>You may delete your Profile (which deletes your Supporting Documents and Public Submissions), from our Sites at any time. However, anyone who viewed your Profile and/or used our Sites may have kept a copy of your information. Some Countries and States require that we, and/or Recruiters that use our Services, retain a copy of the information you provided to them as you used the Services. Deleting your Profile from our Sites does not guarantee that copies of your information are also being deleted.</p>
<p>Other than for storage as Permitted Hidden Information, you should not put social security numbers, bank accounts, personality profiles, or other information you would not want made public, in your Profile, Public Submissions, or any Supporting Document.</p>
<p>If you provide us with details of a reference, it is your responsibility to ensure that the person is aware that you have forwarded his or her contact information and has consented in writing for you to do so. By providing the details of a reference, you warrant and represent that you have obtained that individual’s consent.</p>
<p>All Submissions, including but not limited to Profiles, Supporting Documents, or other information you give to us, must not contain information relating to your (i) racial or ethnic origin, unless you choose to, and it is legal for you to do so (ii) political beliefs (iii) philosophical or religious beliefs (iv) membership of a trade union or political party (v) physical or mental health or biometric details or genetic makeup (vi) addictions, sexual life (vii) the commission of criminal offenses or proceedings and associated penalties or fines, or (viii) the commission of any unlawful or objectionable conduct and associated penalties. If the information you provide does contain any of the above, then you agree that it is at your own risk. We cannot control third parties’ access to such information as they use our Services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Company Information: </em></strong>Your Profile only contains information about you. If you are using our Sites as a Recruiter, you will undertake activities on behalf of your company, (such as posting jobs, writing job descriptions, adding notes, documents, comments, and sending email to Job Seekers, etc.), and these activities create and store information for your company (“Company Information”), that is separate to your Profile.</p>
<p>All Company Information you give to us, must not contain information relating to your (i) racial or ethnic origin, unless you choose to, and it is legal for you to do so (ii) political beliefs (iii) philosophical or religious beliefs (iv) membership of a trade union or political party (v) physical or mental health or biometric details or genetic makeup (vi) addictions, sexual life (vii) the commission of criminal offences or proceedings and associated penalties or fines, or (viii) the commission of any unlawful or objectionable conduct and associated penalties. If the information you provide does contain any of the above, then you agree that it is at your own risk. We cannot control third parties’ access to such information as they use our Services.</p>
<p>If you delete your Profile, Company Information that you may have added as a Recruiter, may or may not be deleted depending on the company’s agreement with Findly, and the various legal laws pertaining to data storage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aggregate Information: </em></strong>This refers to information that does not by itself identify you as a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our Sites and what other sites may have directed you to us. We automatically collect information about how you use our Sites, the areas of our Sites that you visit, as well as information about your computer or mobile device including your IP address, device ID, physical location, browser and operating system type, screen size and referring URLs. This information is necessary for providing personalized and location-based content as well as for analyzing the use of resources, troubleshooting problems, preventing fraud, and improving our Services. We may combine this information with information in your Profile to help prevent fraud.</p>
<p>If you choose to login, add, or otherwise connect with Facebook or similar social network sites (“Social Information”), we may import and/or show the Social Information that you choose to share with, us by installing the application or logging into that platform or site, and we may make the Social Information you chose to share, become part of your Profile.</p>
<p>Our Sites also let you share your Profile publicly; such that your Profile may be accessed by everyone on the Internet, including users without accounts, and may appear in public search engine search</p>
<p>results. You may control the visibility of your information by managing your privacy settings. You may also restrict the information available to others by turning off and/or deleting information you do not want visible, or by not providing the information at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
