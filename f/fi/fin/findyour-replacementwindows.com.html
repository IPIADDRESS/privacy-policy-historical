		<strong>11. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></p>
	<p>

	<p>
		California has passed legislation requiring certain specific disclosures be made available to California residents who use the Internet and provide information that may be used for marketing purposes. That legislation requires any business that discloses a customer's personal information (as defined by the act) to any third party for direct marketing purposes to provide the customer a method for obtaining the names, addresses and certain other specified details of anyone who might have received that personal information. If you are a California resident you may request this information by writing to us at the address below. QuinStreet, Inc. is not obligated to respond to more than one such request from you per calendar year.</p>
