It was well below the roughly 10% pace China had averaged from 1980 until two years ago. Yet according to a new working paper by Lant Pritchett and Larry Summers of Harvard University, it is still abnormal: Chinese growth is likely to be lower still in future.Forecasters often extrapolate from recent growth rates, the authors note. The IMF, for instance, projects that Chinese growth will slow almost imperceptibly over the next five years, from about 7.4% this year to 6.3% by the end of the decade. Yet Messrs Pritchett and Summers point out that if it is possible to infer anything from past patterns of growth around the world, it is that economies suffer from “regression to the mean”: growth rates in countries that have been growing fast tend to drop, often sharply, toward the long-run global average (of about 2% growth per year in real GDP per person).Given this tendency, China’s long spell of breakneck growth—of more than 6% a year since 1977—already stands out. It is, the...">China’s future growth: Even dragons tire</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21627698-myanmar-has-licensed-few-foreign-banks-its-financial-sector-still?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="   Spot the gilded facade SPEND a few days in Yangon, and you can almost believe you are in a country with a functioning financial sector. ATMs, completely absent just a few years ago, now dot the city. Credit cards are increasingly (though still not widely) accepted.Outside the big cities, however, this façade falls away. As of last September Myanmar’s 24 banks—four of which are wholly state-owned and another 11 of which are at least partially government-owned or managed—had a total of 863 bank branches. Thailand, with just 14m more people, had nearly 7,000 more branches; the number of branches per person in Myanmar barely exceeds the level of South Sudan, and falls short of Afghanistan’s and Haiti’s. A report from the International Finance Corporation, published in 2013, estimated that just 5% of Burmese use formal financial services.What banks exist suffer from both restrictions of little prudential value and an antiquated financial system. Loans, for instance, must be highly collateralised—often up to double the amount of the loan—with only a few things (land, gold, some export commodities) accepted as collateral. Loans cannot be made...">Banking in Myanmar: Twinned with South Sudan</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21627721-after-unpromising-start-nigeria-beginning-encourage-local-saving-and?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="FEW people in Africa are fortunate enough to have savings to fall back on in their old age. Having enrolled in a voluntary state-run pension scheme, Stephen Okikiola was always luckier than most. But it was not until Nigeria obliged firms with five or more employees to provide workers with pensions in 2004 that the former pharmaceuticals executive really started accumulating cash. “It’s good to be able to rely on those monthly payments now that I am retired,” he says.Nigeria has spent a decade resurrecting its pension system. Back at the turn of the century, government employees were enrolled in a defined-benefit system (in which eventual payments are fixed). It had run up unfunded liabilities of 2 trillion naira ($12.9 billion). Governments seldom put aside enough money to pay existing pensioners, let alone to cover future costs. Retirees often went unpaid. Most private companies, meanwhile, ignored their obligation to provide pensions for their workers. At those that did, allegations of mismanagement and fraud abounded.All this changed with the reforms of 2004, which not only instituted mandatory pensions at most private firms, but also converted the government scheme from defined-benefit to defined-contribution (in which the risk of poor investment returns lies with the participants, not the sponsor). The management of the government scheme was also outsourced, and a...">Pensions in Nigeria: Fewer ghosts, more savings</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21627699-america-restores-weak-lending-standards-led-housing?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="WHEN politicians bashed Wall Street for its reckless mortgage lending in the wake of the subprime crisis, bankers retorted that it was the politicians’ enthusiasm for expanding home ownership, even if it meant small deposits and low credit standards, that had really fomented the disaster. Yet that enthusiasm is undimmed: in a speech on October 20th Mel Watt, head of the Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA), announced plans to reintroduce mortgages with deposits as low as 3% through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-backed housing giants it regulates.Both Fannie and Freddie were bailed out during the financial crisis. There was much talk in Congress of winding them down; in the meantime, they tightened loan requirements to limit the risk to taxpayers. But that changed when Barack Obama appointed Mr Watt, a congressman from North Carolina and long-term evangelist for home ownership.Fannie and Freddie do not issue mortgages. Instead, they buy them from banks and guarantee the securities into which they are bundled for resale. Over the past two years many big mortgage lenders have paid billions of dollars in fines and been forced to buy back piles of dud loans on the grounds that they did not conform to Fannie’s and Freddie’s rules. These settlements were controversial, in that the pair had actively sought out risky mortgages to satisfy their mission to promote...">Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: Structurally unsound</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21627650-recent-market-turbulence-may-be-only-foretaste-liquid-diet?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="    SOLDIERING has been described as long periods of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror. Financial markets seem to be developing the same pattern.The boredom stems from massive central-bank intervention in markets. As long as investors remain convinced that central banks are in control of events, and can adjust monetary policy to avoid recession and inflation, volatility will be low for most of the time. In these quiet periods, the dominant trend will be momentum—investors buying the assets that have most recently risen in price. By September, for example, investors were heavily exposed to peripheral European bonds (the debt of Greece and Spain, for example) and to cyclical stocks (those that perform best when the economy is doing well).But when the trend changes, prices may move very sharply, as the terrified herd stampedes out of what can be illiquid markets. In the last four weeks, defensive stocks have outperformed cyclicals by one of the greatest margins in history, according to BlackRock, a fund-management group.There was another good illustration of the herd mentality on October 15th, when the yield on ten-year Treasury bonds fell by...">Buttonwood: Liquid diet</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21627628-difficulty-people-have-getting-jobs-makes-unemployment-unnecessarily?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="    IN THE OECD, a club mostly of rich countries, nearly 45m people are unemployed. Of these, 16m have been seeking work for over a year. Many put this apparently intractable scourge down to workers’ inadequate skills or overgenerous welfare states. But might geography also play a role?In a paper* published in 1965, John Kain, an economist at Harvard University, proposed what came to be known as the “spatial-mismatch hypothesis”. Kain had noticed that while the unemployment rate in America as a whole was below 5%, it was 40% in many black, inner-city communities. He suggested that high and persistent urban joblessness was due to a movement of jobs away from the inner city, coupled with the inability of those living there to move closer to the places where jobs had gone, due to racial discrimination in housing. Employers might also discriminate against those that came from “bad” neighbourhoods. As a result, finding work was tough for many inner-city types, especially if public transport was poor and they did not own a car.For the past 50 years, urban economists have argued over Kain’s theory. Some, like William Julius Wilson, then of Chicago University, pointed...">Free exchange: The geography of joblessness</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21627717-regulators-are-worried-trendy-new-product-will-sow-instability-emerging?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="    COULD the hottest trend in investment management be the greatest danger to financial stability? Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—pooled portfolios of assets that trade on stockmarkets, usually linked to an index—have grown from a total value of $416 billion in 2005 to $2.5 trillion today. Their rapid growth has left regulators worrying about what might happen if the money that has flowed into ETFs decides to flow out again.Investors can sell their holdings in ETFs throughout the day, but the assets of some ETFs may be hard to sell immediately. One obvious area is the corporate-bond market, where banks have retreated from trading, and so hold less inventory. There are some 46,000 separate bond issues, not all of which will find ready buyers during a rout.In other words, there is a potential mismatch between the liquidity of the funds and the liquidity of the assets they own. A stampede out of ETFs might cause a fire sale of assets that would ripple through the financial system. Defenders of the industry, however, say these concerns are overstated; after all, it weathered the sell-off in equities and corporate bonds in 2008-09.To understand ETFs fully...">Exchange-traded funds: Emerging Trouble in the Future?</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21627718-despite-constant-political-upheaval-pakistans-stockmarket-doing-well-oil?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="    IN OCTOBER 1987 the landmark privatisation of British Petroleum (now BP) was derailed by “Black Monday”, a big stockmarket crash. Pakistan’s planned divestment of a 7.5% stake in OGDCL, a listed but largely state-owned oil firm, has not been quite as cursed, but the circumstances could be more propitious. Pakistan’s government has been on the back foot following street protests in August and September. A nuisance suit to stop the sale was quashed this week by the Supreme Court. But there is likely to be a further delay while OGDCL publishes its results. Meanwhile the oil price has fallen sharply, as have stockmarkets around the world.The good news for Pakistan’s government is that the appetite for local assets has been strong. Since the start of 2012 MSCI’s index of Pakistani shares has risen by 60% in dollar terms—ahead of global indices as well as Pakistan’s peers among frontier markets, which are less liquid and less open to foreign capital than others (see chart). The surprise is that the market did not fall further over the torrid summer. That was thanks largely to foreigners, who kept piling in even as jittery locals began selling.

In April, just two years after Greece imposed the biggest sovereign-debt restructuring in history on its private creditors, it raised €3 billion ($4.2 billion at the time) in five-year bonds at a yield of less than 5%. In July its ten-year bonds were yielding less than 6% and their Spanish and Italian equivalents less than 3%, not far off Germany’s. The troubled economies of Europe’s “periphery” were beginning to turn around, it seemed, and the European Central Bank (ECB) would do whatever it took to keep the euro zone together.That all went out the window in the global market sell-off of October 15th-16th. Yields on Greek government debt briefly exceeded 9%; the spread between yields on German government bonds and those of debt-addled euro-zone countries widened and lower-rated corporate-bond yields rose sharply too. Part of the rise might have been due to bond markets’ declining liquidity. At any rate, some ground has since been regained, with corporate bonds especially buoyed by the rumour (later denied) that the ECB was about to buy corporate debt as part of an asset-purchase scheme.But worries that slow growth in the...">The euro crisis: Back to reality</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21625825-fears-deflation-may-lie-behind-recent-weakness-bears-no-picnic?fsrc=rss%7Cfec" title="    THE mood in financial markets has turned gloomy again. Equity markets are retreating, commodity prices are falling and investors are stampeding for the safety of government bonds (see chart). Volatility has soared: the VIX, a measure of how much investors are willing to pay to insure against sharp market moves, has more than doubled since July.Perhaps the most remarkable development is the strength of government bonds. At the start of the year, a survey of fund managers by Towers Watson, an actuary, found that 81% were bearish on government bonds. Many commentators were talking about the end of a 30-year bull market. But the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds (which moves in the opposite direction to prices) briefly dropped below 2% on October 15th, having stood at 3.02% on January 1st.This fall in yields has occurred even though the Federal Reserve has been steadily reducing its bond purchases, just as it said it would. Private-sector buyers have been eager to step into the breach. After all, yields on Treasuries are substantially higher than those in most of Europe (German 10-year yields dropped to 0.72% on October 15th) and American inflation is...">Buttonwood: Bears, but no picnic</a></li></ul></li><li id="text-2" class="widget widget-sidebar widget_text">			<div class="textwidget"><iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="600" width="160" rel="inline-banner" zone="WS1" style="display:block; margin:0 auto;"></iframe></div>
