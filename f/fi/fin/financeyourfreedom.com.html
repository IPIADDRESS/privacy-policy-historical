                    <b>Technology</b><br>
                    Finance Your Freedom uses a feature of your Internet browser
                    called a "cookie". Cookies are files that your Web
                    browser places on your computer's hard drive. Finance Your
                    Freedom also uses "web beacons", also known as clear
                    gif technology, or action tags. Web beacons are tiny colorless
                    image files placed in a web page that are served by Finance
                    Your Freedom and counted when served. Web beacons are used
                    to track the completion and submittal of applications. There
                    are many misconceptions about cookies and web beacons, some
                    of which we will try to clarify here for you.</p>
                  <p>Cookies and web beacons, by themselves, do not tell us your
                    e-mail address or other personally identifiable information
                    unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for
                    example, submitting a Lender referral request. Finance Your
                    Freedom does not and cannot use cookies or web beacons to
                    retrieve personal information about you from your computer
                    unless you knowingly and willingly provided such information.
                    However, once you choose to furnish Finance Your Freedom with
                    personally identifiable information, this information may
                    be linked to the data stored in the cookie and recorded at
                    Finance Your Freedom after a web beacon is counted.</p>
                  <p>Cookies and web beacons also help ensure that you don't see
                    an offer that you have already completed. If you choose not
                    to have your browser accept cookies and web beacons from Finance
                    Your Freedom you will not be able to participate in the free
                    gift and service opportunities, and will likely experience
                    the same ads and offers repeatedly, because Finance Your Freedom
                    will have no way of knowing if you have already seen them.</p>
                  <p><b>What information is collected automatically?</b><br>
