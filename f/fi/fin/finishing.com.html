<h3><font color="#336633">Information that you supply on forms</font>
</h3>

<p><b>Name, city, &amp; State</b>: Finishing.com is largely a place
of camaraderie for people with metal finishing interests. Therefore
we are NOT an anonymous service. When you post an inquiry or
response, we require and print your full name, city, and state--like
a newspaper or magazine would.</p>

<p><b>E-mail address:</b> We also require your e-mail address. We
don't print it on technical letters, but we do include it on articles
submitted to our Editorial page. Please do not disguise your e-mail
address because we can't print your posting until an auto-reply
confirms your e-mail address.</p>

<p><b>Company name:</b> We do not require your company name. We print
it only if you choose (and then only if we choose).</p>

<dl>
   <dt><b>What information do we make available to others?</b> We do
   not compile, maintain, or sell any mailing lists. However, this is
   an advertiser-supported site, and many visitors are looking for
   suppliers. So, on a one-contact-at-a-time basis, we do pass along
   the contact information for a specific inquiry to an advertiser
   who wishes to respond to you. When we do so, we attach the
   following instruction--
   
   </dt><dd>-------<br>
   
   PRIVACY NOTICE: This contact info is forwarded to you under the
   terms agreed to by the inquirer who provided it. You may respond
   to THIS SPECIFIC INQUIRY but you may not add this contact
   information to any database, send any unsolicited offerings of any
   type to the inquirer, nor pass this contact info to any third
   party.

   the Internet! Your IP address is always available. Finishing.com
   often captures the IP address when someone fills in a form on our
   site, clicks on a banner ad, or links to an external site. </font>

   </dd><dd><font color="#000000">Why? We are a commercial website which
   can only exist with the support of our advertisers. Visitors can
   conveniently visit our site and 'click-thru' to our advertisers'
   sites from finishing.com without any need for registration here --
   so we need to be able to show that our site is directing the
   visitors to them.</font>

   </dt><dt><b><font color="#000000">Cookies:</font></b><font color="#000000"> Finishing.com does not use 'cookies' internally.
   That is, we do not make any automated attempt to track which pages
   or sites a particular visitor has or has not accessed, how
   frequently they have visited, etc. We do not keep any logs of that
   nature. However, when you click on a banner or link that takes you
   to another site, that link may include 'tracking code' to tell
   that site that you came from finishing.com, and the external site
   may save info about you. </font>

<h3><font color="#336633">Scams</font></h3>

<p>If you submit an offer which gives us reasonable grounds for
suspicion that it is part of an illegal scam (Nigerian 419 letters,
'black money' offers, 'cleaning chemicals for defaced bills',
'copper-iridium rice pulling items') we may forward it to the
authorities without notice</p>

<h3><font color="#336633">Complaints</font></h3>

<p>If you feel that an advertiser here has spammed you, or that a
spammer obtained your contact info through this site, please let us
know. Thanks!</p>
