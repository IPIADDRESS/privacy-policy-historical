    <p><span class="subhead">PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT CAREFULLY.<br></span>
       MakeMusic, Inc. (the “Company”) has a strong commitment to protecting
	personal privacy. We will respect certain privacy principles regarding the personal
	information that you provide. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to tell you
	what information we gather on these websites, how we use the information, and how
	we protect your privacy.</p>
	
	<p>This Privacy Statement applies to all Company websites,
	with homepages located at www.makemusic.com, www.smartmusic.com, and www.finalemusic.com,
	and all subsections under these homepages (the “Sites” or “Websites”). This Privacy
	Statement does not apply to information we gather by mail, telephone, or other off-line
	methods.</p>
	
	<p>This Privacy Statement was last revised on September, 2010. We may change this Privacy 
	Statement at any time and for any reason.  We encourage you to look to this Privacy Statement 
	each time you visit the Site.  By using this Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement. </p>
	
	 <p><span class="subhead">PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY</span><br>
	 The ways
	we protect and use information collected over these Websites depends upon the type
	of information involved. In general, personal information – information that tells
	us who you are – is used only for limited purposes and receives strong protection.
	Non-personal information – anonymous information that does not tell us who you are
	– is used for many purposes and shared with others, as described below. </p>
	
	<p><span class="subhead">
	WHAT IS
	NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION?</span><br> Each time a computer visits these Sites to read or download
	information, we may collect certain information from that computer. This information
	is automatically collected from the computer’s web browser and may include information
	such as the following (“non-personal information”): </p>
	<ul>
		<li>the type of web browser software the computer uses (for example, Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) </li>
		<li>the name of the Internet domain from which the computer accessed our Sites </li>
		<li>the Internet address of the website from which the computer linked directly to our Sites </li>
		<li>the	date and time the computer accessed our Sites </li>
	</ul>
		
	<p><b>Non-personal information does not
	tell us who you are. </b></p>
	
	<p>Also, we may place a text file called a cookie in the browser
	files of computers that visit this Site. Cookies are pieces of information issued
	by a website that, among other things, allow your computer to utilize all the features
	on this Site. If and when your computer accepts a cookie, the cookie may be stored
	on the computer’s hard drive. The information that we collect using cookies is non-personal
	information.</p>
	
	<p>US Government Information Bulletin (I-034) contains a good description
	of cookie technology at: http://www.ciac.org/ciac/bulletins/i-034.shtml. You are
	always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our
	Sites may not work properly for you if you do so. </p>
	
	<p><span class="subhead">
	WHAT DO WE DO WITH NON-PERSONAL
	INFORMATION? </span><br>
	We will use non-personal information to help us make our Sites more
	useful to visitors and for other business purposes. For example, we may tell business
	partners how many computers visited these Sites or what type of music exercises
	are most popular. Also, we may use the non-personal information in cookies to help
	us to personalize these Sites according to the preferences you tell us, and make
	your visit a more convenient experience. We may prepare reports and other materials
	using non-personal information. Since these reports and materials contain no personal
	information, we may share them with others. </p>
	
	<p><span class="subhead">
	WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?</span><br> In the
	process of registering for a username and password, enrolling for a class (if applicable),
	and in some other places on these Sites, some visitors may have the chance to send
	us “personal information”. Personal information includes information that tells
	us specifically who a person is, such as a person’s name, telephone number, email
	address, payment and financial information, or home address. </p>
	
	<p><span class="subhead">
	HOW DO WE COLLECT PERSONAL
	INFORMATION? </span><br>The only way we learn or collect personal information online 
	is if a visitor chooses to provide us with that information.  For example, if you fill 
	out a form to receive and pay for services through this website, you will tell us and 
	we will learn your name and some other personal information about you. </p>
	
	 <p>Under certain conditions another user may provide us with personal information about another Website
	user. For example, a teacher or school administrator may enter into a Website a
	list of names of the students in the teachers’ class. </p>
	
	<p><span class="subhead">
	HOW DO WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</span><br>
	If you submit personal information, you agree that we may keep a record of the personal
	information. For example, we may keep a record of your name and e-mail address in
	order to keep track of the username and password we assigned to you. We also may
	use personal information to help us in our business, including but not limited to
	improving these Sites and marketing and product development. If you sign up to receive
	certain services or enroll in certain classes (if applicable), we may share your
	personal information, including information regarding your performance of exercises
	and use of the Websites, with your authorized teacher and school. You also agree
	that we may share personal information with other businesses that help us with these
	activities. For example, if you pay for services by credit card, we will share your
	name with the credit card company, such as Visa or MasterCard, so that we can get
	paid. These other companies may not use or share your personal information with
	others except for the purpose of assisting us with our business activities pursuant
	to our request. Sometimes we send offers to select MakeMusic customers on behalf of 
	other music-related businesses. When we do this, we do NOT give that business your 
	name and address. You agree	that we may use your personal information to mail or 
	email information to you about our products and services.</p>
	
	 <p>We may also share personal information in connection
	with a change of control of the Company, merger, transfer, or sale of all or part
	of the Company or similar transaction, or if required to comply with a law, regulation,
	court order, or other legal process. We may share personal information to protect
	our rights or property. </p>
	
	<p><span class="subhead">		
	WHAT HAPPENS IF THE PRIVACY STATEMENT CHANGES?</span><br> If we decide
	to make a significant change to our Privacy Statement, we will post a notice on
	the homepages of our Sites for a period of time after the change is made.</p>
	
	 <p><span class="subhead">
	WHAT ABOUT
	PRIVACY ON OTHER SITES?</span><br> These Sites may contain links to other websites. We provide
	these links for your convenience, but we do not review, control, or monitor the
	privacy practices of websites operated by others. We are not responsible for the
	performance of these sites or for your business dealings with them. Your use of
	other websites is subject to the terms and conditions of those sites, including
	the privacy policies of those sites. </p>
	
	<p><span class="subhead">
	ARE THERE SPECIAL RULES ABOUT CHILDREN’S PRIVACY?</span><br>
	We care about protecting the online privacy of children.  We may collect certain 
	information about children for the purpose of providing our educational services, 
	but we collect information from children under 13 only with the consent of a parent 
	or guardian.   If you believe that we have improperly collected information from a 
	person under the age of 13, please send us a letter by First Class Postage Prepaid 
	U.S. Mail or overnight courier to the following address:</p>

	(1) the name of the alleged child, along with their username; (2) the age and birth
