              <h3>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT CAREFULLY.</h3>
<p>MakeMusic, Inc. (“Company”) has a strong commitment to protecting personal privacy. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to tell you about our privacy practices for the website or application where this Privacy Statement is published. Please read this Privacy Statement to learn what information we collect, how we use the information, and how we protect your privacy.</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement applies to all Company websites, Company desktop applications and Company mobile applications (the “Services”), including the pages on our Services where you subscribe or register as a user of one of our products. This Privacy Statement does not apply to information we gather by mail, telephone, or other off-line methods.</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement was last revised on December 3, 2014. We may change this Privacy Statement at any time and for any reason. We encourage you to look to this Privacy Statement each time you visit this Site. By using the Services or our software or services that reference this Site, including our SmartMusic®, Garritan® and Finale® products, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement. If you have any questions about the changes please contact us by mail or phone as listed below.</p>
<p><strong>PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY</strong></p>
<p>The ways we protect and use information collected over our Services depend upon the type of information and the reason that we collected it. In general, personal information – information that tells us who you are – is used for limited purposes and receives strong protection. Anonymous, non-personally identifiable information is used for many purposes and shared with others, as described below.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO WE COLLECT, USE, AND PROTECT ENROLLMENT INFORMATION REGARDING STUDENTS?</strong></p>
<p>Enrollment information is a student’s name, birthdate, address, phone number, identification number, scores, class, grade, school district, school, music teacher’s name, and a user name and password created by the student.&nbsp; In the case of students under the age of 13, enrollment information also includes contact information for that student’s parent or guardian. Enrollment information also may include non-public school information that is provided to us by a student’s teacher or school district, such as a student’s grade or identification number.</p>
<p>We will use enrollment information to notify the parent or guardian of an enrollee under the age of 13 of the student’s enrollment, and to give the parent or guardian information regarding their right to cancel the enrollment and to access and manage the enrollment information.&nbsp; We use enrollment information to enable the student to submit assignments to their music teacher, and to allow the music teacher to issue and manage assignments and contact their students through a web-based assignment and e-mail program.&nbsp; We also use enrollment information to manage and renew subscriptions, if the enrollee decides to subscribe to one of our products (in which case the information becomes subscription/registration information, and can be used by us in the additional ways described below.)</p>
<p>We will share enrollment information with the teacher and school associated with the enrollment.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may share information in connection with a change of control of the Company, merger, transfer, or sale of all or part of the Company or similar transaction, with a vendor who needs the information to provide services to us, or if required to comply with a law, regulation, court order, or other legal process.</p>
<p>We will not (a) use enrollment information (including any of the non-public school information) for any other purposes, (b) give enrollment information to a third party to allow that third party to market its goods or services, (c) use it to market our own services, and (d) convey, copy, transfer, or otherwise disclose enrollment information, including non-public school data, in any other way without prior written authorization.&nbsp; We will maintain these protections for enrollment information data even after a student (or his or her school) stops using our music Gradebook product.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO WE COLLECT, USE AND PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM OTHER USERS?</strong></p>
<p>We may collect other personal information, including a name, email, and other contact and personal information, such as payment and financial information, or home address, from you if you buy one of our products or services or register for a feature on one of our Services.&nbsp; We refer to this personal information as “subscription/registration information.” Subscription/registration information also includes other information associated with a user, such as password or subscription number.&nbsp; For example, if you fill out a form to receive and pay for services through one of our Services, you will tell us and we will learn your name and some other personal information about you.&nbsp; If you submit personal information as part of a subscription for a product, or registration for an online forum or other feature, you agree that we may keep a record of the personal information. For example, we may keep a record of your name and e-mail address in order to keep track of your username and password. We also may use subscription/registration information to help us in our business, including but not limited to improving our Services and our products, to contact you with information about our products and services, to administer your account and provide you services; to send communications and administrative emails, and to respond to your inquiries.</p>
<p>We may use certain non-identifying demographic registration information from Finale® users for analytics purposes. Such non-identifying demographic registration information includes, but is not limited to, country, self-identification as a teacher, student, engraver, composer, performer, etc. We may associate certain non-identifying demographic registration information with an anonymous unique ID.</p>
<p>We may share subscription/registration information with third party service providers who help us with our business.&nbsp; For example, if you pay for products or services by credit card, we will share your name with the credit card company, such as Visa or MasterCard, so that we can get paid.&nbsp; These other companies may not use or share your personal information with others except for the purpose of assisting us with our business activities pursuant to our request. We also may share your personal information with our trusted business partners, such as our distributors, to allow them to contact you with information about other products or services that may interest you, unless you elect not to receive such information.</p>
<p>We may share subscription/registration information in connection with a change of control of the Company, merger, transfer, or sale of all or part of the Company or similar transaction, or if required to comply with a law, regulation, court order, or other legal process. We may share subscription/registration information to protect our rights or property.</p>
<p>Please note that when you share information with the Company through one of our Services, you are sending your information to a location in the United States and it will be handled in accordance with the laws of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p>Each time a computer visits one of our Services to read or download information, we may collect certain information from that computer. We track this information using either cookies or a third party API, which assigns an anonymous unique identifier. This information is automatically collected from the user’s computer and may include information such as the following (“non-personal information”):</p>
<ul>
<li>the type of web browser software the computer uses (for example, Safari or Internet Explorer)</li>
<li>the name of the Internet domain from which the computer accessed our Services</li>
<li>the Internet address of the website from which the computer linked directly to our Services</li>
<li>the date and time the computer accessed our Services</li>
<li>the usage of accompaniments that is collected to pay royalties to the music copyright holders</li>
<li>the behavior and usage patterns of users on our Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our mobile applications, we use Flurry Analytics (“Flurry”) to collect, monitor and analyze non-personal information in order to increase the Services’ functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Services to our users’’ needs. Accordingly, non-personal information is shared with Flurry, which has its own privacy policy (accessible at <a href="http://www.flurry.com/privacy-policy.html" target="_blank">http://www.flurry.com/privacy-policy.html</a>) addressing how these parties use such information. You may opt out of Flurry Analytics tracking and personalized ads/recommendations from Flurry by clicking <a href="http://www.flurry.com/resources/privacy.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Please note that the opt-out is specific to Flurry activities and does not affect the activities of other ad networks or analytics providers.</p>
<p><strong>NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES NOT TELL US WHO YOU ARE</strong></p>
<p>We may place a text file called a cookie or an anonymous identifier in the browser files of computers that visit the Services. Cookies are pieces of information that, among other things, allow your computer to utilize all the features on the Services. An anonymous identifier is a random string of characters that is used for the same purposes as a cookie on platforms, including certain mobile devices, where cookie technology is not available. If and when your computer accepts a cookie or an anonymous identifier, the cookie or the anonymous identifier may be stored on the computer’s hard drive. The information that we collect using cookies or an anonymous identifier is non-personal information. You are always free to decline our cookies or anonymous identifier if your browser permits, but some parts of our Services may not work properly for you if you do so.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DO WE DO WITH NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p>We will use non-personal information to help us make our Services more useful to visitors and for other business purposes. For example, we may tell business partners how many computers visited our Services or what type of music exercises are most popular. Also, we may use the non-personal information in cookies to help us to personalize our Services according to the preferences you tell us, and make your visit a more convenient experience. We may prepare reports and other materials using non-personal information, including ammonized enrollment or subscription/registration information. Since these reports and materials contain no personal information, we may share them with others.</p>
<p>We may also obtain non-personal information from third-party sources, and may combine it with other non-personal information that we have collected. To help ensure that you have consistent, high quality experiences with our Services, and to assist us with product development and planning, we collect anonymous usage statistics. We do this by assigning a unique identifier in our databases that is NOT linked to any of your personal information. At times we may share this usage information with third parties, but only in an anonymous aggregated form.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF THE PRIVACY STATEMENT CHANGES?</strong></p>
<p>If we decide to make a significant change to our Privacy Statement, we will post a notice on the homepages of our Services for a period of time after the change is made.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ABOUT PRIVACY ON OTHER SITES?</strong></p>
<p>Our Services may contain links to other sites. We provide these links for your convenience, but we do not review, control, or monitor the privacy practices of sites operated by others. We are not responsible for the performance of these sites or for your business dealings with them. Your use of other websites is subject to the terms and conditions of those sites, including the privacy policies of those sites.</p>
<p><strong>ARE THERE SPECIAL RULES ABOUT CHILDREN’S PRIVACY?</strong></p>
<p>We care about protecting the online privacy of children. We may collect certain information about children for the purpose of providing our educational services as described in the sections above regarding enrollment information.&nbsp; When we collect enrollment information, we ask for a student’s birthdate to determine whether the student is a child under the age of 13. Other than enrollment information, we collect information from children under 13 only with the prior consent of a parent or guardian. If you believe that we have improperly collected information from a person under the age of 13, please send us a letter by First Class Postage Prepaid U.S. Mail or overnight courier to the following address:</p>
<p>MakeMusic, Inc.<br>
7007 Winchester Circle, Suit 140<br>
Boulder, CO&nbsp;80301<br>
USA</p>
<p>You should clearly state, at a minimum, (1) the name of the alleged child, along with their username; (2) the age and birth date of the child; (3) your relationship to the child (e.g., parent, guardian, teacher); (4) as much detail as possible regarding the information you believe was provided improperly by the child.</p>
<p>In addition, if you are a parent/guardian and wish to review information submitted by your child, you may contact us at the address above or by calling 1-800-843-2066 (for the USA) and, after confirming your identity, we will provide you with an opportunity to review, and if you wish delete, such information.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO YOU VIEW OR EDIT PERSONAL INFORMATION AND PREFERENCES?</strong></p>
<p>Go to My Account and log in to view and/or update any personal information provided, such as mailing and billing addresses, e-mail addresses, or preferences. Please note that even if you choose not to receive marketing communications, we may still contact you for important policy or technical product updates or for information related to your services from us.</p>
<p><strong>FINALE</strong>®<strong> OPT OUT </strong></p>
<p>For Finale® users who would like to opt-out of our usage of your non-personal information for analytics purposes, you can do so by choosing “Help Improve Finale” from the Finale® Help menu and selecting the “no” button”.</p>
