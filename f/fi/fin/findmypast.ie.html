We also gather some statistics about your computer, such as the browser you use and how big your screen is. We gather personal information (e.g. name, address, phone number, email address, postal address) about you when you register, pay for a service or <a href="/articles/using-the-site/contact-us" class="">get in contact with us</a>, or sometimes if you reply to a survey.
<br><br>If you create a family tree or create content on the website, we also manage that information, which may include personal information about you and other people (for example, names and birthdays of people in your family). We always aim to gather only the information that we need in order to provide the records and services which you have subscribed to and/or purchased PayAsYouGo credits for.
<br><br><b>What we use this information for:</b> We won’t keep your personal information for longer than is necessary and will only use the personal information that we gather

<br><br><b>We won’t sell your information to third parties:</b> We won’t ever sell your information to third parties, full stop. If we run a promotion or competition where your information would be shared with a third party for marketing purposes, we will make that very clear and will ask your permission first.
<br><br><b>Who in our company sees your information:</b> Only specific people within our Group Companies (meaning brightsolid online publishing (Ireland) Limited, and any subsidiary and/or parent company of brightsolid online publishing (Ireland) Limited that might exist in the future) have access to your information, and we restrict this as much as we can.

Service emails include registration and payment confirmations, warnings that we are about to charge you or that your subscription or credits are about to expire, and welcome emails that provide useful information about how to use a service or feature when you sign up or start using it. Also, if we make a fundamental change to the website or our Terms &amp; Conditions that we think we need to make you aware of (for legal or simply for courtesy reasons), we will send you a service email.
<br><br><b>Unsubscribing from service emails:</b> Because of the nature of these emails, we don’t allow you to unsubscribe, but we can switch off your account if you are no longer interested in using the website. <a href="/articles/using-the-site/contact-us" class="">Contact our Customer Support team</a> to do this.
<br><br><b>Our use of cookies:</b> We use cookies (small information files that are stored on your computer) to help us provide many features on the website. You can choose not to accept cookies from us (by changing your browser’s security settings) but if you do, the website might not work as intended and some features may not work at all. Cookies are safe: please read this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookies_%28Internet%29" target="_blank">short guide</a> if you want to know more about them.
<br><br><b>Seeing what information we hold on you:</b> If you want to know what personal information we hold on you, get in contact and we’ll be happy to supply you with it: there is a €6.35 administration charge to cover the cost of pulling it together.
<br><br><b>Updating your personal information:</b> If the information we hold about you is no longer correct, please update your details in the ‘my account’ area or alternatively,  <a href="/articles/using-the-site/contact-us" class="">let us know</a> and we will update our records.
<br><br><b>When we might disclose your information:</b> We will only disclose your information to somebody outside our group companies (or who is processing your information on our behalf under contract) if we are required to by law.
<br><br><b>If we change hands:</b> If findmypast’s business transfers to anyone else, you agree that we can pass your information to that person, so they can continue to provide you with the service.
<br><br><b>Changes to this policy:</b> We might make changes to this policy from time to time – check back here to stay up to date. If we make a major change to it, we’ll send you a service email describing the change and what it means for you.
<br><br><b>Contact Us:</b> We hope that’s clear. If it isn’t or you have another question that isn’t covered, please  <a href="/articles/using-the-site/contact-us" class="">contact us.</a>
