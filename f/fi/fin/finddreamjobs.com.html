If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, you are not authorized to use the Site.</p><p><br></p><p><b>How We Collection Information and the Types Collected. &nbsp;</b>We and our marketing partners and Affiliates collect Information in a number of different ways. We collect Information when a User registers on our Site and provides us identifying PII such as their name, email, address, date of birth, telephone number and gender. We also use technological means to collect Information about a User such as the type of device and browser they are using, where they were browsing before they arrived at our Site, their IP address and if a User is on a mobile device, which carrier they use. We may use third-party data provided by our affiliates (which includes our parent, subsidiaries and other entities under common control with us) (collectively, “Affiliates”) sources including those provided by our parent and its subsidiaries (“Affiliates”) to augment and/or verify the Information we collect from users and may also associate demographic and other data we collect, such as the user’s browser and device, with their Information.</p><p><br></p><p>If you reached the Site by clicking on a link or an ad from another website or from an email sent from one of our marketing partners, then we may also capture that information to understand the interests of our Users and to keep track of third parties who direct Users to our Sites. Users may supply information through our dynamically determined survey questions which we then associate with the User’s PII to help us identify the products and services they may be interested in. We track and record a User’s behavior while on our Site and associate it with the User’s PII so that if a User returns to our Site, we can, for example, avoid showing the User the same offers or asking the same survey questions.</p><p><br></p><p>In order for a User to take full advantage of the Site, we ask Users to voluntarily provide their PII to us. If a User chooses not to provide us with their PII by simply not entering it on the Site or not otherwise providing it to us, the User will not be able to access or use certain of the services or features available through the Site.</p><p><br></p><p><b>How We Use the Information We Collect. &nbsp;</b>We may use the Information (whether PII or non-PII) that a User provides us to, among other things to:</p><p></p><ul><li>Help administer and protect the security of the Site and provide communication and other services and, in that regard, may share Information with third parties, including vendors and contractors who provide services to us;<br></li><li>Process or complete transactions that a User requests including providing a User’s Information to Affiliates and other third parties;<br></li><li>Contact Users regarding customer service and administrative issues, such as questions about a User’s specific request, or otherwise respond to a User’s comments or requests;<br></li><li>Send Users emails with information and offers from us, our marketing partners and/or Affiliates;<br></li><li>Maintain suppression or opt-out lists that we may share with third parties so that a User is not contacted when the User has asked not to be;<br></li><li>Track online behavior for behavioral advertising and other marketing purposes. &nbsp;If a user registers on one of our Websites, the user may receive relevant third-party daily emails from that Website, its exclusive emailing partner and other websites we or our Affiliates own and/or operate;<br></li><li>Develop and/or enhance products and/or services by our Affiliates and/or third parties;<br></li><li>Make telephone calls and send text messages to you with information and offers provided you consent to be marketed to in this manner as described further below;<br></li><li>Compile anonymous statistical information and analysis which may be provided to Affiliates and other third parties;<br></li><li>Provide, sell, or rent your Information to Affiliates and other third parties for advertising purposes;&nbsp;<br></li><li>Permit you to access certain web-based programs or applications on the Site;<br></li><li>If we are sold, merge with a third-party, are acquired or are the subject of bankruptcy proceedings, your Information may be shared with the applicable third-party(ies);
