				<h1>Privacy policy</h1>

				<div>FindA has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. This document discloses our information gathering and usage practices. For additional information about FindA, please review our Terms and Conditions. <br>
<br>
By using FindA you permit the collection and use of your personal information as outlined below in our Privacy Policy.&nbsp; You should view this page periodically to review any changes to the Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of your information</strong><br>
FindA does not sell or rent your personal identification to third parties. <br>
<br>
We release account and other personal information only when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our terms and conditions; or protect the rights, property, or safety of FindA Limited, our users, or others. <br>
<br>
Information such as your full name and any personally identifiable information you have included in your reviews may be shown to other users in conjunction with reviews you have contributed.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Links Our website may contain links to third party websites to which we have no affiliation.&nbsp; FindA does not share your personal information with those websites.&nbsp; We encourage you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from this website.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the privacy statements or other information posted or collected via those websites.<br>
<br>
<strong>Email</strong><br>
It is the policy of FindA to send our members email throughout the listing process and other email they elect to receive, in addition to customary business communications (payment confirmations, etc). <br>
<br>
Further, it is our policy to immediately remove any member from any mailing list upon the member's request. In addition, FindA may send a regular newsletter to members. Newsletters will contain clear and obvious instructions for how the member can remove himself or herself from that mailing list. <br>
<br>
We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our members, and we encourage you to email us with your questions or comments. <br>
<br>
<strong>Emailing Tools</strong><br>
FindA provides facilities throughout the site to refer a friend to FindA or to send references to a specific listing or product to a friend. You may not use the "Email This Link to a Friend" service or other email forwarding services that we offer to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our privacy policy or Terms and Conditions. We do not permanently store, sell, or rent these email messages or the email addresses. <br>
<br>
<strong>Membership Registration</strong><br>
Our site's registration form requires you to provide us contact information and may also require demographic information. We may use your contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company and promotional material from some of our affiliated partners. Your contact information is also used to contact you when necessary. <br>
<br>
<strong>Controlling Your Personal Information</strong><br>
You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) via reviews, messages, forums, postings, or in other areas of the FindA site, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties.&nbsp; Such activities are beyond the control of FindA.&nbsp; Please do not post any personal information on the FindA site or in other areas that you expect to keep private.<br>
<br>
<strong>Updating Your Personal Information</strong><br>
FindA provides you with ways in which you can alter your personal data, including changing your email address, password, phone number, etc. FindA will store previous email addresses against your profile to ensure compliance with our Terms and Conditions - specifically the use of one account per member.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Control of Your Password</strong><br>
You are responsible for all actions taken with your user name, email address and password, including fees. Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your FindA password to any third parties. If you choose to share your user name, email address and password or your information with third parties to provide you additional services, you are responsible for all actions taken with this information and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy. <br>
<br>

<br>
Users who login have their IP addresses recorded. This information can be used to track users who abuse the FindA system and will be only be provided to legal authorities in cases of suspected fraud. IP addresses can be used, in conjunction with an Internet Service Provider, to find the dial-in account of a user and, ultimately, further information to identify a user. This information is stored securely and will not be provided to other members or non-authorised parties. <br>
<br>
If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. <br>
<br>
<strong>Membership Removal</strong><br>
If you wish to have your registration removed from our directory for any reason, simply send us an email requesting to be removed. Alternatively, Members may de-register themselves on the Site.<br>
Advertising and Third Party Links<br>
<br>
Some FindA advertisers may request information directly from users, or link to sites that do so. FindA has no control over its advertisers ' privacy policies, and encourages users to review such policies prior to submitting any personal information to them. <br>
<br>
FindA may contain non-advertising links to a variety of third party sites to enhance the member experience. FindA has no control of either the content or privacy policies of such sites, nor should such links be considered an endorsement of these sites except where otherwise noted. <br>
<br>
