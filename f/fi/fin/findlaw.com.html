or mobile application experience that delivers the information, resources, and

to provide some personal information, for example, your name, address, phone

</ul>
<p>If you contact us for customer support, we may ask you to provide information
about your computer or about the issues you are trying to resolve. This
information is necessary to help us answer your questions. We may record your
requests and our responses for quality control purposes.</p>
<p>Some FindLaw websites make chat rooms, forums, message boards, or news groups
available to you. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas
is public. You should exercise caution when disclosing personal information in
these areas. Please do not submit any confidential, proprietary or sensitive
personally identifiable information (e.g. Social Security Number; date of birth;
drivers license number; or credit card, bank account or other financial
information) (collectively, “Sensitive Information”). If you submit any
Sensitive Information, you do so at your own risk and we will not be liable to
you or responsible for consequences of your submission.</p>
<p>Websites that FindLaw hosts for law firm and attorney customers may allow you
to submit information to the law firm via a contact form or online chat. Any
information that you voluntarily submit through the site may be shared with and
stored by FindLaw so that FindLaw may provide services to the law firm or
attorney. Please do not submit any Sensitive Information through the website
contact form or online chat.</p>
<p>Additionally, FindLaw offers legal professionals the ability to provide
personal information for inclusion in the
<a href="http://www.profileupdate.findlaw.com/">FindLaw Lawyer Directory</a>. If
you submit your information, know that:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be accurate, complete, and current. It will be distributed to third
parties in multiple formats (including online), and you will not be compensated
by FindLaw in any way for its use.</li>
<li>FindLaw has no control over how third parties use your profile information;
these third parties may contact you for any purpose, including marketing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Web Server Logs </strong></p>
<p>When you visit our website, we may track information about your visit and
store that information in web server logs, which are records of the activities
on our sites. Our servers automatically capture and save the information
electronically. Examples of the information we may collect include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your unique Internet protocol address</li>
<li>The name of your unique Internet service provider</li>
<li>The city, state, and country from which you access our website</li>
<li>The kind of browser or computer you use</li>
<li>The number of links you click within the site</li>
<li>The date and time of your visit</li>
<li>The web page from which you arrived to our site</li>
<li>The pages you viewed on the site</li>
<li>Certain searches/queries that you conducted via our website(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>The information we collect in web server logs helps us administer the site,
analyze its usage, protect the website and its content from inappropriate use,
and improve the user's experience.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies </strong></p>
<p>In order to offer and provide a customized and personal service, we may use
cookies to store and help track information about you. Cookies are simply small
pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on
your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to help remind us who you are and to
help you navigate our sites during your visits. Cookies allow us to save
passwords and preferences for you so you won't have to reenter them each time
you visit.</p>
<p>The use of cookies is relatively standard. Most browsers are initially set up
to accept cookies. However, if you prefer, you can set your browser to either
notify you when you receive a cookie or to refuse to accept cookies. You should
understand that some features of many sites may not function properly if you
don't accept cookies.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Services</strong></p>
<p>We may use services hosted by third parties, such as Google Analytics, to
assist in providing our services and to help us understand our customers' use of
our products. These services may collect information sent by your browser as
part of a web page request, including your IP address or cookies. If these third
party services collect information, they do so anonymously and in the aggregate
to provide information helpful to us such as website trends, without identifying
individual visitors. Please see "Cookies" in the section above for information
on how you can control the use of cookies on your computer.</p>

<p><strong>How does FindLaw protect the personal information that it
collects?</strong></p>
<p>We have implemented certain appropriate security measures to help protect
your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access,
use, or disclosure. For example, some of our websites are protected with Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Also, we store the information about you in a
data center with restricted access and appropriate monitoring, and we use a
variety of technical security measures to secure your data. In addition, we use
intrusion detection and virus protection software. <strong>However, please note
that we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will always be unable to
defeat our security measures</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, please note that we may store and process your personal information in
systems located outside of your home country. However, regardless of where
storage and processing may occur, we take appropriate steps to ensure that your
information is protected, consistent with the principles set forth under this
statement.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Who has access to the personal information?</strong></p>
<p>We will not sell, rent, or lease mailing lists or other customer data to
others, and we will not make your personal information available to any
unaffiliated parties, except as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To agents and/or contractors who may use it on our behalf or in connection
with their relationship with us (for example, we may use third parties to help
us with promotional campaigns).</li>
<li>Information that is submitted through a contact form or online chat on law
firm and attorney websites hosted by FindLaw may be shared with or referred to
an unaffiliated attorney if that law firm or attorney is unable to assist with
your matter.</li>
<li>As required by law, in a matter of public safety or policy, as needed in
connection with the transfer of our business assets (for example, if we are
acquired by another company or if we are liquidated during bankruptcy
proceedings), or if we believe in good faith that sharing the data is necessary
to protect our rights or property.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also rely on some of our affiliates for support of the products and
services we offer, and we share some of our back-office functions with other
Thomson Reuters companies. Our affiliates are all required to preserve the
confidentiality of any personal information they may access.</p>
<p>We will not disclose any information about your usage to unaffiliated third
parties, except as necessary to service the account, to enforce the terms of
use, to meet our obligations to content and technology providers, or as required
by law. We may also use statistics regarding usage for product development
purposes, but we only use those statistics in the aggregate and they don't
include any personally identifiable information about individual users.</p>
<p>Your access to some of our services and content may be password protected. We
recommend that you refrain from disclosing your username(s) and password(s) to
anyone. We also recommend that you sign out of your account or service at the
end of each session. You may also wish to close your browser window when you
have finished your work, especially if you share a computer with someone else or
if you are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.
