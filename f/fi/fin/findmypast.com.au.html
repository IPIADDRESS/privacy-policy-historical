For example, we may send a Service Announcement if there is a disruption of service, a change in price or a major change to the service.</p>         <p>We may automatically send Administrative emails when you take certain actions such as changing your password. We may also send Welcome messages that are informational and provide details about service activation or product usage instructions when you sign up for the service.</p>                  <p>5.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to be able to send you Service Announcements, Administrative or Welcome emails which you will not be able to unsubscribe from.
