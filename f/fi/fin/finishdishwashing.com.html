                            A. Information Collected
                        </h2>
                        <p>This privacy policy applies only to information collected on the Sites and does not apply to information collected by RB through any other means.</p>
<p>We collect two types of information from visitors to the Sites: (1) Personally Identifiable Information; and (2) Non- Personally Identifiable Information, such as your IP address or cookies.</p>
<p><strong>(1) Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br> "Personally Identifiable Information" is information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, or company name. RB collects and stores the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us. Here are some examples of manners in which we may collect your personally identifiable information on the Sites:</p>
<p>We may collect your first and last name and product or service details if you contact us with a question related to our products or services; <br> We may collect your first and last name, mailing address and billing information if you purchase a product or service on the Sites; <br> We may collect registration details about a product that you purchase from RB and this information may be tied to your name and mailing address; <br> We may collect your first and last name, mailing information, email address and billing information if you download information from a Site; <br> We may collect your name, email address or phone number if you contact us with a question; <br> We may collect your first and last name, date of birth and email address if you choose to participate in a contest or sweepstakes; and/or <br> We may collect your name and mobile phone number if you consent to receive autodialed and/or pre-recorded telemarketing messages from or on behalf of us at your mobile number. <br> The above list is only an example of the types of personally identifiable information that may be collected on the Sites. If you do not want RB to collect your personally identifiable information, please do not provide it to us.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br> "Non-Personally Identifiable Information" can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, location, gender or interests. Non-personally identifiable information does NOT identify you personally. Here are some examples of the non-personally identifiable information that is collected via the Sites:</p>
<p>Internet Protocol (IP) address -- Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the webpages you view.</p>
<p>Cookie -- A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on the Sites. For example, when someone visits a page within the Sites, a cookie is placed on the user's machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited the Sites previously. Cookies may also be used to track users across the Web. We use the information we collect from cookies for marketing and product planning purposes. Collected data may also be shared, in aggregate form, with third-parties (e.g., dealers, marketers, and distributors). We do not currently honor any “do-not-track” signal sent by browsers. However, you may opt-out of targeted advertising from National Advertising Initiative members by visiting <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</span></a></span>. You may also set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users to our Sites. Additionally, some of the cookies we use may be flash cookies or Adobe cookies. While they are harmless, they may contain non-personally identifiable information and depending on your browser these cookies may not normally be deleted when your cookies are deleted. Please check your browser to determine where these types of cookies are stored and how they may be deleted.</p>
<p>Web Beacons (also known as "clear gifs," "web bugs" or "pixel tags") -- "Web Beacons" are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Sites and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages.</p>
<p>Product Information -- We may collect registration information or other details about your product or service. Unless this information is tied to your name or address, it is not considered personally identifiable.</p>
<p>We may collect the above non-personally identifiable information from all visitors to our Sites. If you do not want RB to have access to this information, please do not visit our Sites.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>(1) Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br> We use your personally identifiable information that is collected on these Sites primarily for the following purposes:</p>
<p>To deliver services;</p>
<p>To alert you to special offers, updated information and other new products or services from RB, or other third parties, or to forward promotional materials to you;</p>
<p>To complete a transaction or service requested by you;</p>
<p>To fulfill the terms of a promotion;</p>

<p>To help us create and publish content most relevant to you;</p>
<p>To notify you about a material change to this privacy policy or our Terms of Use, if necessary;</p>
<p>To allow you access to limited-entry areas of the Sites; and</p>
<p>To contact you in response to sign up forms such as Contact Us or other inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br> Non-personally identifiable information is used as described above and in other ways as permitted by applicable laws, including combining non-personally identifiable information with personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>

                        </h2>
                        <p><strong>(1) Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br> We may share or disclose your personally identifiable information in the following instances:</p>
<p>To fulfill a service to you. For example, if you purchase or download an item from a site, we may share your personally identifiable information in order to provide the item to you. In addition, if you email us a question, we may use your email address to process your request and respond to your question. In addition, if you purchase a product via the Sites, we may need to share your data with third parties in order to have that product delivered to you and installed as you requested. Also, if you are entering a sweepstakes or contest, we may use your personally identifiable information in order to fulfill the terms of that promotion.</p>
<p>To our parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates in order to better serve you. RB may have to share your data with these parties in order to provide you with services that have been requested by you, or so that we can ensure our services and products are meeting your needs.</p>
<p>To strategic partners, agents, third party marketers or other unaffiliated parties who are offering products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. These parties may use your personally identifiable information to contact you with an offer or advertisement related to a product or service. If you do not want us to share your personally identifiable information in this manner, please do not provide us with this information.</p>
<p>To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents or independent contractors who help us maintain our Sites and provide other administrative services to us (including, but not limited to, order processing and fulfillment, providing customer service, maintaining and analyzing data, sending customer communications on RB's behalf, and entry collection, winner selection and prize fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes and other promotions). We seek to ensure that these unaffiliated third parties will not use the personally identifiable information for any other purpose than to provide the administrative services for which they are responsible. Because such unaffiliated third-party service providers that help us administer our Sites will have access to users' personally identifiable information, if you do not wish for our unaffiliated third-party service providers to have access to your information, please do not register or submit any personally identifiable information to us.</p>
<p>To complete your purchase. If you choose to make a purchase on the Sites, we may collect from you your credit card number, billing address and other information related to such purchase, and we may use such collected information in order to fulfill your purchase. We may also provide such information, or other personally identifiable information provided by you, to unaffiliated third parties as necessary to complete your purchase (for example, to process your credit card).</p>
<p>To comply with the law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the requirements of law or comply with legal process served on us, protect and defend our rights or property, including the rights and property of RB or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our end users.</p>
<p>To third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.</p>
<p>To track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.</p>
<p>To protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the information collected from these Sites. In the course of such verification, we may receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, if you use a credit card or debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.</p>
<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy or at the time we request the information, we do not otherwise use, share or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information to any third parties.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br> We use non-personally identifiable information collected on the Sites in the manner disclosed above, in the Section A (2). We may share this non-personal information with third parties.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>From time to time, we communicate with users who subscribe to our services via email. For example, we may use your email address to confirm your request, to send you notice of payments, to send you information about changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law.
