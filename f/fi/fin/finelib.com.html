Users can always refuse to supply personally identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site related activities.</p>



<h3>Non-personal identification information</h3>

<p>We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our Site. Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer and technical information about Users means of connection to our Site, such as the operating system and the Internet service providers utilized and other similar information.</p>



<h3>Web browser cookies</h3>

<h3>Advertising</h3>

<p>Ads appearing on our site may be delivered to Users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.

our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program)
information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some
cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New
York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites
visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).</p>

<p>You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser
settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can
affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the
