                        <h1>FINDWHAT.COM PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
        <p>Effective January 1, 2014</p>
        <p><strong>This Policy may change from time to time. Please check back frequently for updates.</strong></p>

        <p>Adknowledge EN, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Findwhat.com (“Findwhat”, “we”, or “us”) respect and protect the privacy of consumers.  This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes what information we collect through Findwhat.com, how we use that information, and some of your privacy rights regarding that information.</p><p>
        </p><ol>
            <li><p><strong>Collection of Information and Your Privacy Rights</strong></p>
                <p><em>What information we collect and how we collect it.</em></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><u>Subscription or Survey Information</u>. Findwhat collects information from you when you voluntarily provide it to Findwhat or one of its partners, through websites (owned and operated by Findwhat or a third party), social networking applications and other means (together, these sources are referenced hereafter as "Publishers") (for example, by signing up for an email newsletter or through a co-registration offer on a survey), or by others means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "User Form"). In a User Form, Findwhat or a third party may offer you incentives in exchange for providing information about yourself such as name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers, birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, employment information, and personal and online interests (together, "User Information"). Completing the User Form is voluntary and you are under no obligation to provide User Information.</li>
                    <li><u>Vendor List Information</u>. Findwhat may obtain information about you after you provide information to a third party and you permit that party (the "Seller") to share the information, which Findwhat subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise lawfully acquires. Such information may include, but is not limited to, your name, street address, zip code, telephone numbers, birth date, gender, salary range, education, marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and other information which you provided to the Seller (together, "Vendor List Information"). When acquiring Vendor List Information, Findwhat requires assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Vendor List Information to Findwhat and that Findwhat may lawfully use the Vendor List Information to transmit offers from advertisers.</li>
                    <li><u>User Behaviors Collected with Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information</u>. Findwhat uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you, such as your Internet Protocol address and what Web browser you are using, with certain of your online behaviors, such as opening or clicking on a particular online advertisement. Additionally, Findwhat may use other new and evolving sources of information and information gathering in the future (together, "Technology Information").
                        <ol>
                            <li type="a">Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of your computer that allows Findwhat and/or its partners to identify your IP address with corresponding information in Findwhat's database. Findwhat and/or its partners may use cookies to track individual responses or views of advertisements, and use this information to help predict what other advertisements may be of interest to you and enable you to receive customized advertisements or content. These cookies contain no personally identifiable information. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, such as your email address, that we may share with any third party, solely in hashed, non-human readable form.
