<p>We at Findery take your privacy very seriously. This Privacy Policy (a few portions have been adapted from a policy originally provided by <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> (<a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>)) describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and participate within the Findery community. We also describe various Findery features so you can be mindful of what and where you share content. It is made available under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Sharealike</a> license. Please read this notice very carefully. </p>

<p>Findery members must be at least 13 years old. If you become aware that your child has created an account, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@findery.com">privacy@findery</a>.</p>

<p><b>What personal information do we collect?</b></p>

<p>-- <b>Information that you elect to share with us</b><br>
When you create an account, we require an email address (we may send you an email to verify) and username. You may also elect to add a personal picture that represents you within the site and add your real name. Some of this information will be visible to the public, but your email address will remain private. You can also create "Home" and "Work" personal places where other members can leave you notes. Notes left at these locations will only appear on a map to you. When others view these notes, the location is hidden. You may modify any of your information at any time via your <a href="https://findery.com/settings">settings page</a>.</p>

<p>-- <b>Information collected automatically</b><br>
• When you visit the website, we ask the browser for your location. If you accept, we use that information to show you nearby notes. We store your last map position locally in your browser, but we don't keep this information on the server anywhere. If you decline, you’ll still have access to every Findery feature.<br>
• When you access Findery via the mobile web or the iPhone app, your location is determined via GPS and/or nearby networds and/or cell towers. <br>
• We gather anonymized user actions for analytics to make Findery more better for everyone.</p>

<p><b>Creating notes</b><br>
The key functionality of Findery is leaving stories, information and/or images for your friends or the public to find. As you create these notes you should be mindful of your privacy. You may not want to leave a note publicly that identifies where you live. Additionally, you should be mindful of the privacy of others when you create notes. While you may be comfortable sharing an anecdote of that great party you went to where that crazy lady fell down drunk, your hosts may prefer that their humble abode not be featured in such a way. If you do find that your home has been featured in a way that identifies you as the resident, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@findery.com">privacy@findery.com</a>.</p>

<p><b>Finding notes</b><br>
We've implemented a 10 minute delay related to the notifications around finding a note so that you can "unfind" a note. Let's say your best friend leaves a note "A great time was had by all" and much to your horror, when you visit the note, your friend's great time was had at Big Jim's Boobie Bungalow. Your brain screams "undo, undo" and that can be accomplished with "unfind". Simply mouse over your avatar and click "Yes please." There's more info in <a href="https://findery.com/faq">our FAQs</a>.</p>

<p><b>How your information is shared</b><br>
Other than to its employees and contractors who may view your account information as part of their day to day efforts, Findery will disclose potentially-personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law.</p>

<p><b>How your information is stored</b><br>
All non-personally-identifying information, potentially personally-identifying and personally identifying-information described above is stored on restricted database servers. </p>

<p><b>How we communicate with you</b><br>
We have a myriad of notifications to keep you in the loop regarding how members are interacting with you and your notes. You can opt-out of some or all of these on your <a href="https://findery.com/settings/notifications/">settings page</a>. From time to time, we may send you helpful marketing and non-marketing company notifications. Our marketing messages will contain an unsubscribe link if you’d like to remove yourself from receiving those messages. You won't be able to opt-out of company notifications, but they will be infrequent and directly related to your use of Findery.</p>

<p><b>Cookies</b><br>
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Findery uses cookies to help Findery identify and track visitors, their usage of the Findery website, and their website access preferences. Findery visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Findery's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Findery's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<p><b>HTML5 Local Storage</b><br>
HTML5 local storage is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Findery uses local storage to authenticate users to the website and remember recent state, such as the last location of the map. HTML5 Local Storage is required for Findery to work.</p>

<p><b>Links to 3rd party sites</b><br>
Members may include links to 3rd party sites within the notes that they share. Our privacy policy covers only the content on Findery. Please take care when visiting any third party sites.</p>

<p><b>Business Transfers</b><br>
If Findery or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the event that Findery goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Findery may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy. That said, we will communicate this transfer to you in a timely manner prior to the event so that you may determine whether or not you'd like to continue using Findery.</p>

<p><b>Ads</b><br>
Advertising may appear within Findery. Currently, any member may create a sponsored note, and while this may come with aggregate data regarding the activity around their notes, advertisers will not have any additional access to member account information beyond what you've specified in your account settings.</p>

<p><b>How can I delete my account?</b><br>
You may terminate your Findery account at any time. There's a link at the bottom of your Settings page that leads to <a href="https://findery.com/settings/delete">Delete my account</a>. Please note that account deletion is permanent. All of your content will be removed from Findery and your username will be made immediately made available for someone else to register.</p>

<p><b>Changes to our Privacy Policy</b><br>
Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change our Privacy Policy from time to time, and at our sole discretion. If we do then we'll notify you by posting the amended policy on the website or by emailing you of the nature of the modifications along with a link to the modified document so that you can review it. In all cases, use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.</p>

<p>Should you have any questions about this document, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@findery.com">privacy@findery.com</a>.</p>
