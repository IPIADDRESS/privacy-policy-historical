We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our sites. Our cookies expire after two years, and we reset this timeline after a year. Ad companies place cookies on your computer to track your activities across various sites so that they can display targeted ads. Some ad companies and game developers use "flash cookies" for ads and games that use Flash media technology.</p> <p>Many ad companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative. NAI members allow users to opt out of being tracked by cookies. To opt out of cookie tracking by NAI members, you may visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a> and click on the "Consumer Opt-out" button.

These technologies are used to access cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page is viewed). For example, we use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our features and services. Ad companies use pixel tags to measure the number of ads displayed and their performance (such as how many people clicked on an ad).</p> <h2>Children's privacy</h2> <p>We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are not 13 or older, you may not create an account with us.</p> <h2>Information from users outside the United States</h2> <p>If you're outside the United States, your information will be sent to and stored in the United States, where our servers are located.
