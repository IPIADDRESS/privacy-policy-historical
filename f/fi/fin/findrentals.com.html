<h1>FindRentals.com Customer Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>

	The FindRentals.com Customer Privacy Policy has been developed
	as an extension of our commitment to combine the finest quality
	products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing
	with our customers. The Policy guides how we collect, store and
	use information about customers and prospects, and it will be
	periodically assessed against new technologies, business practices
	and our customers' changing needs. The FindRentals.com site may,
	from time to time, modify this Customer Privacy Policy to reflect
	legal, technological and other developments. In that event the
	changes will appear at this location. Our Policy recognizes two
	kinds of personal data that deserve varying levels of protection.
	Personally-Identifiable Information includes, for example, e-mail
	addresses, billing information, employment status and "click stream"
	data that tracks user activity on a Web site or online service. FindRentals.com
	is committed to using all reasonable efforts to abide by the following
	Policy statement:
</p>
<br>
<b>Collection.</b><br>
<br>

the extent that FindRentals.com deems reasonably necessary to
serve a legitimate business purpose. Please be aware that if you
disclose Personally-Identifiable Information on Website, that
information may be collected and used by third parties without
our knowledge and may result in unsolicited communications from
third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of FindRentals.com.<br>
<br>
<b>Security.</b><br>
<br>
Appropriate safeguards will be implemented to ensure the security,
integrity and privacy of Personally-Identifiable Information about
our customers and prospects. <br>
<br>
<b>Access.</b><br>
<br>
Review and correction. Procedures have been developed through
which customers and prospects can, upon request, review and correct
the Personally-Identifiable Information that has been collected
from them by FindRentals.com. These procedures may not, however,
compromise the security, integrity and privacy of either FindRentals.com
own proprietary databases or databases licensed from third party
companies.<br>
