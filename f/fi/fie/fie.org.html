In instances where an electrical scoring apparatus is not used, four judges preside over the match.","new-to-fencing.competition.paragraph2":"Referees will tests weapons prior to a match to ensure they are legal. Other equipment, such as masks, body wires, and gloves, are typically checked by the armoury prior to the start of a competition.","new-to-fencing.competition.paragraph3":"Opponents typically test each other’s target area before the start of a bout to ensure they are properly connected to the circuit. They then walk to the en garde area to salute one another and the referee. After their masks are on and they are in the en garde position, the referee will say ‘Pret Allez’ to start the bout. Note that the referee is also called the director.","new-to-fencing.competition.paragraph4":"When a valid touch is scored, fencers return to the en garde area before the bout resumes. If a bout is halted for other reasons, such as an off-target touch, the action typically resumes from where it was halted.","new-to-fencing.competition.paragraph5":"There are three three-minute rounds in fencing. If time elapses with a tie, the bout enters Sudden Death Overtime. In this case, one fencer is given priority at random. If no one scores a touch during this time, the fencer with priority wins.","new-to-fencing.competition.paragraph6":"However, in pool rounds, fencers are divided into groups and fence to five hits.

The first fencer to 15 points wins.","new-to-fencing.intro.title":"Introduction to Fencing","new-to-fencing.weapons.epee.paragraph1":"The epee has a total length of 110cm and its blade is 90cm long. The total weight of the weapon must be less than 770g.

Any hit which is made is counted. Hits are awarded solely on the basis of which fencer makes a hit first, according to an electrical recording apparatus.","new-to-fencing.weapons.epee.paragraph4":"Also, double-hits are allowed in epee, although the hits must occur within 40 milliseconds (1/25 of a second) of each other.","new-to-fencing.weapons.epee.title":"The Épée","new-to-fencing.weapons.foil.paragraph1":"The foil has a total length of 110cm and its blade is 90cm long.

Fencers can only score a hit by striking the point of their weapon on the defined target area of their opponent, which is limited to the torso only.","new-to-fencing.weapons.foil.paragraph3":"Non-valid hits also stop the bout, but are not counted.","new-to-fencing.weapons.foil.paragraph4":"The foil is governed by the rules of right of way. The fencer who starts an attack has the right of way. In order to avoid being hit, the opposing foil fencer usually attempts to parry the attack and, if this is successful, riposte. To avoid being parried, the attacker may use several tactics, such as disengages or coupes, which are different ways to avoid the opponents’ blade.","new-to-fencing.weapons.foil.title":"The Foil","new-to-fencing.weapons.paragraph1":"There are three weapons used in fencing: épée, foil, or saber.","new-to-fencing.weapons.paragraph2":"Each weapon has its own characteristics, rules, and signature style.","new-to-fencing.weapons.sabre.paragraph1":"The sabre has a total length of 105cm and its blade is 88cm long.
