    <p>We also may use the information we obtain about you in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.</p>

    <h2 id="sec_ot">Online Tracking</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party web analytics services on our Site, such as Google Analytics. These service providers help us analyze how users use our Site. The information collected for this purpose (including your IP address and other information collected by automated means) will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers.

    <h2 id="sec_iws">Information We Share</h2>
    <p>We may share the information you provide with companies that are related to Macmillan through common ownership.  We may also share the personal information we obtain with our publishing partners.</p>

These third parties may contact you directly about their products and services. We will not share your information with these third parties for their own marketing purposes if you request that we not do so. We may, however, engage in joint marketing activities with selected third parties and may share personal information about our Site visitors with them.</p>

    <p>We share personal information with third parties who perform services on our behalf.  For example, when you make a purchase we may share information about you and your transaction with other companies for the purpose of processing your transaction.  In addition, we may retain third party service providers to manage our customer databases or distribute e-mail offerings.</p>

    <p>We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena), (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.  We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).</p>

    <h2 id="sec_low">Links To Other Websites</h2>
    <p>Our Site may contain links to other websites for your convenience and information.  These may include, for example, some of the blogs and forums you may access through this Site.

    <h2 id="sec_ncr">Notice to California Residents</h2>
    <p>California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In the alternative, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has opted out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. As discussed above in the section entitled “Your Choices”, if you wish to opt-out of our sharing of your information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, please follow the appropriate opt-out link in that section.</p>

    <h2 id="sec_ac">Access and Correction</h2>

To exercise these rights, please contact us as indicated in the How To Contact Us section of this Online Privacy Notice.  To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we may take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the information. If you are resident in the EU, a charge may be applicable before we provide a copy to you of any of your personal information that we maintain.</p>

    <h2 id="sec_dt">Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to countries other than the country in which the information originally was collected.  Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information.   When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Online Privacy Notice and in accordance with applicable law. Where your personal information is collected in the EEA and we then transfer it outside the EEA, we will ensure that an adequate level of protection is in place to protect your personal information.</p>

    <h2 id="sec_uopnc">Updates To Our Online Privacy Notice</h2>
    <p>Changes to this Online Privacy Notice will become effective when those changes are posted to the Site. Your continued use of the Site subsequent to any change to this Online Privacy Notice constitutes your acceptance of the change.
