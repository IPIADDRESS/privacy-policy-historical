<h3 class="bodyMainTitle">Privacy Policy</h3>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Last Revised: April 12, 2004</h5>
<h5 class="bodySubTitle"><i>Our commitment to you:  User data and contact information obtained by Fisher Investments will never be sold to any third party.</i></h5>

</a><p class="bodyText"><a name="top">If you have any questions concerning Fisher Investment's Privacy Policy, please send us an email to </a><a class="bodyLink" href="mailto:privacy@fi.com">privacy@fi.com</a>. We'll be glad to help!</p>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Introduction</h5>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments, Inc. provides investment management services to over 10,000 high net worth clients worldwide. As a world-class organization, we are committed to providing the highest quality of service to all of our customers.  We also have a responsibility to our customers, the public, and our profession to deliver our services in a professional manner, with uncompromising values and standards. As such, the firm must and will in all respects comply with all relevant Federal and State laws, regulations and requirements.</p>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments is committed to providing you with a clear explanation of its Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy covers privacy issues as they relate to US, Canada, and UK online marketing initiatives and www.fi.com, www.fi-canada.com, www.fisherinvestments.co.uk, pcg.fisherinvestments.com, www.fi-inst.com, and all respective subdirectories.</p>

<p class="bodyText"></p>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Email</h5>

<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments always likes to hear from our valued clients 
  and prospective clients, and we collect the email addresses of users who communicate 
  with us via email or request information via our website. Fisher Investments 
  collects email addresses and other data collected online from current and prospective 
  clients so that we can provide them with the information they've requested, 
  whether from Fisher Investments or from one of our marketing partners.</p>
<p class="bodyText">In certain instances, Fisher Investments uses the services of partner companies who may help us reach prospective clients by collecting email addresses. Please note that these addresses come from people who <i>specifically request information on Fisher Investments via clearly labeled online advertising</i>.</p>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments collects online data from prospective employees 
  via our website. You can be assured that resumes and personal information submitted 
  to us will be held confidential and will not be shared with any third parties.</p>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments also sponsors third party email content. 
  In order to receive Fisher Investments' email content through a third party, 
  you would have had to previously subscribed to a particular service or "opted-in" 
  to receive relevant promotional content from advertising partners. As advertisers, 
  we do not gain access to users' contact information—this information is 
  kept confidential—nor does Fisher Investments supply additional users from 
  our own internal database. Rather, the respective online publisher distributes 
  content on our behalf.</p>
<p class="bodyText">If you have received Fisher Investments' email content through 
  a third party, you must unsubscribe or "opt-out" through the respective 
  publisher. The only way to avoid receiving promotional offers like these in 
  the future (from Fisher Investments or other companies) is by going directly 
  to the respective publisher and unsubscribing from their list.</p>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments does, however, maintain a suppression file 
  of email addresses in compliance with the CAN SPAM Act of 2003 (S.877). This 
  list is updated daily and provided to publishers with instructions to exclude 
  the respective email addresses from sponsored email campaigns. For instructions 
  on adding your name to Fisher Investments' email suppression file, see the section 
  called "Removal from the Fisher Investments Database."</p>
<p class="bodyText"></p>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Online Advertising</h5>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments' advertising is in full compliance with 
  Internet, advertising and finance industry standards and regulations. Our advertising 
  content is integrated and delivered with online publisher's primary content 
  in a variety of different formats; some ads are embedded in the website (e.g. 
  banner) while others are delivered by an independent browser window (e.g. pop-up). 
</p>
<p class="bodyText">The delivery of our pop-up and pop-under ads (and frequency 
  thereof) is ultimately controlled by the respective online publisher. Unfortunately, 
  we are unable to restrict the delivery of our popup advertisements to individual 
  users. Typically, pop-ups are "frequency capped" so users should only 
  receive one pop-up ad per site session (based on the respective publisher's 
  ad serving policy). However, this functionality will NOT work if you have disabled 
  "cookies" in your browser. If you are experiencing a high volume of 
  popup ads, then it might be an issue with your Internet browser's ability to 
  accept "cookies". It is important that you have "cookies" 
  enabled in your browser settings. </p>
<p class="bodyText">The information we collect through online advertising is anonymous 
  and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone 
  number, or email address. To best serve users with offers that are of relevance, 
  Fisher Investments has formed relationships with companies that place ads on 
  third party publishers' websites. In addition, these companies may track advertising 
  that are placed within certain email newsletters. As a result of users visiting 
  its website, ad server companies may collect information about users such as 
  domain type, IP address, and clickstream data. <i>Please note that this information 
  is not individually identifiable</i>.</p>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, 
  to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management 
  partner. These files enable the ad serving system to recognize a unique cookie 
  on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements 
  bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser 
  who also works with our ad management partner. </p>
<p class="bodyText">With cookies, the information we collect is anonymous and 
  not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone 
  number, or email address.</p>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Cookies</h5>
<p class="bodyText">What is a "cookie"? A cookie is a small data file 
  containing information, such as a link that a user clicked on, which is written 
  to the user's hard drive by a web server and used to track the pages visited. 
  They do not contain user passwords. The individual information gathered in this 
  manner is used for internal purposes only, such as customizing content. We also 
  use the information on an aggregate basis, to track the usage of our website 
  and to analyze traffic patterns. </p>
<p class="bodyText">You can control your browser's settings regarding cookies 
  by selecting "Internet Options" or "Preferences" in the 
  menu bar of your browser. This will allow you to prevent your browser from accepting 
  new cookies, have your browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or 
  disable cookies altogether. However, because cookies provide benefits like streamlining 
  the website so visitors can find the information they are looking for more easily, 
  we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>


<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Partners</h5>
<p class="bodyText">Certain partner organizations review aggregate cookie and email data in order to help Fisher Investments get a better understanding of the users visiting its website. <i>These companies do NOT have access to individual user information</i>. The cumulative data they maintain for Fisher Investments is expressly NOT SHARED with other organizations for commercial purposes. User data and contact information obtained by Fisher Investments will never be sold to any third party.</p>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">General Privacy Notice for Fisher Investments' Clients</h5>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments collects nonpublic information about users from the following sources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information received on applications or other forms;</li>
  <li>Information provided orally</li>
  <li>Information about transactions or online behavior with Fisher Investments 
    or other publishers </li>
</ul>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments does not disclose any nonpublic personal information about its clients or non-clients without explicit authorization from the respective party, except as permitted by law or in response to inquires from governmental authorities.</p>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments restricts access to personal and account information to those personnel who need to know that information to conduct business. Fisher Investments may also disclose that information to unaffiliated third parties (such as to brokers or custodians) only as permitted by law and only as needed for Fisher Investments to provide agreed services to clients. Fisher Investments maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard nonpublic personal information.</p>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Privacy Policy Updates</h5>
<p class="bodyText">From time to time, Fisher Investments may use data for new, 
  unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If its information 
  practices change at some time in the future Fisher Investments will post the 
  policy changes to its website to notify users of these changes and provide the 
  ability to "opt-out" or unsubscribe from these new uses. If users are concerned 
  about how information is used, they should check back to this location periodically.</p>


<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Updating or Correcting Personal Information</h5>
<p class="bodyText">Upon request, Fisher Investments will provide site visitors 
  with access to respective contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number) 
  that is maintained about them. To access this information, please email <a class="bodyLink" href="mailto:privacy@fi.com">privacy@fi.com</a>. 
  Upon request, Fisher Investments will also offer visitors the ability to have 
  inaccuracies corrected in the database. Users can have this information corrected 
  by sending email to <a class="bodyLink" href="mailto:privacy@fi.com">privacy@fi.com</a>. </p>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Removal from the Fisher Investments Database</h5>
<p class="bodyText">If contact information is willingly provided to Fisher Investments 
  by mail, phone, email, online, or otherwise, in response to our marketing activities, 
  individuals may receive subsequent periodic information from Fisher Investments 
  on new products and services or upcoming events. If individuals don't wish to 
  receive such information, please let Fisher Investments know by sending an email 
  to <a class="bodyLink" href="mailto:privacy@fi.com">privacy@fi.com</a>, or by 
  writing to the following address: </p>
<p align="center">Fisher Investments, Inc.
	<br>ATTN: Marketing Department
	<br>13100 Skyline Boulevard
	<br>Woodside, CA 94062
</p>
<p class="bodyText">Please provide Fisher Investments with the exact name and 
  address as it was originally provided. We will be happy to remove your name 
  from our database and will do everything possible to honor your request for 
  removal.</p>
<p class="bodyText">To unsubscribe from Fisher Investments' email communications, 
  send an email to <a class="bodyLink" href="mailto:optout@fi.com">optout@fi.com</a>. Please put "UNSUBSCRIBE" in the subject

  any additional email addresses you would like suppressed. We will do our best 
  to prevent you from receiving our email content in the future. </p>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Security</h5>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments has appropriate security measures in place 
  at its physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration 
  of private information collected from users. If users feel that this website 
  is not following its stated privacy policy, they are encouraged to contact Fisher 
  Investments at <a class="bodyLink" href="mailto:privacy@fi.com">privacy@fi.com</a>. </p>
