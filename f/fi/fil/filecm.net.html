					Note: the privacy practices set forth in this privacy policy are for this website and our practices only. If you link to other web sites, please review the privacy policies posted at those sites.  
				</p>
				<strong>Use Of Cookies</strong>
				<p class="justify">
					AdShift Media Ltd uses cookies to identify the individual with his or her corresponding tracking data that resides in AdShift Media Ltd's database. Individuals who use the Website need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Website. For EU residents, by using the Website you accept the use of cookies by us under the EU 2012 modification to the EU Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive.

				</p>
				<strong>Tracking Data</strong>
				<p class="justify">
					To ensure we can provide a fraud-free service, AdShift Media Ltd's lead tracking system gathers IP addresses and other user variables along with setting tracking cookies. We use this information to prevent users from abusing advertiser terms and conditions, for example by doing multiple completions per person (regardless of IP address).  
				</p>
				<strong>Use Of Web Beacon Technology</strong>
				<p class="justify">
					A web beacon is a small pixel image that is placed on a website or in an email which is used to monitor behaviour of a user visiting a website or email and store their information. This allows AdShift Media Ltd to track certain websites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioural habits for marketing purposes.   
				</p>
				<strong>Outside Information</strong>
				<p class="justify">
