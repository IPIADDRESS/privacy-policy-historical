  <h1>Filestrum  Privacy Policy Guidelines</h1>
  <p><br clear="all">
    Your privacy is important to us. We have  prepared this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, protect, and  disclose Personal Information and Usage Data when you use the Filestrum online  file hosting service ("Service"). This Privacy Policy also explains  your choices for managing your information and your preferences.<br clear="all">
  <br clear="all">
    This Privacy Policy may be revised from time to  time. By using the Service, you agree to be bound and to abide by the most  recent version of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy was last updated on  01/08/2012.<br clear="all">
  </p>
  <p><strong>Managing Your Information  Preferences</strong></p>
  <p>You can review, correct,  update, or change your Personal Information, or opt out of any direct marketing  in which we may engage, by changing the relevant setting in your Filestrum  profile or account (if you have one), or by e-mailing us at  support@Filestrum.com. If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy  Policy, please e-mail us at support@Filestrum.com.<br clear="all">
  </p>
  <h3>Information We Collect and  How We Collect It
  </h3>
  <p><strong>Personal  Information.</strong>&nbsp;You  can use certain features of the Service without providing us with any  information that identifies or may be used to directly identify you (“Personal  Information”). We collect certain Personal Information when you register with  Filestrum, including your username, e-mail address, and payment information  (i.e., a third party payment processor identifier). We may collect other  Personal Information if you become a Partner or Reseller or use certain  features of the Service. We collect Personal Information only if you choose to  share it with us. The decision to provide this information is optional.  However, if you choose not provide the requested information, you may not be  able to use certain features of the Service.<br clear="all">
    <br clear="all">
    <strong>Usage Data.</strong>&nbsp;We automatically collect usage information that does  not directly identify an individual user ("Usage Data"). For example,  each time you use the Service we may automatically collect the type of Web  browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, your IP  address, the links you use, and the time and duration of your use of the  Service. We use this Usage Data to help us understand how people use the  Service, and to enhance the services we offer. None of this information can be  used to directly identify you, and we will not use it for the purpose of  attempting to identify you. Please be aware, however, that we may be required  to disclose information such as your IP address (a unique numerical identifier  for your computer that may or may not change over time) which could be used by  others to attempt to identify you.<br clear="all">
    <br clear="all">
    <strong>Cookies and Web Beacons.</strong>&nbsp;We use cookies (a small text file placed on your  computer to identify your computer and Web browser when you use the Service).  We may also use Web beacons (an electronic file placed on a website that  monitors usage). We do not use cookies or Web beacons to collect Personal  Information. We use cookies and Web beacons to improve the quality of the  Service. Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can  reset your Web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is  being sent. However, certain features of the Service may not work if you delete  or disable cookies. Some of our Service Providers, as discussed below, may use  their own cookies or Web beacons in connection with the services they perform  on our behalf.<br clear="all">
    <br clear="all">
    <strong>Storage of Information.</strong>&nbsp;The information Filestrum collects about you and your  usage of the Service will be transmitted to and stored by Filestrum on servers  located within the European Union. More information about the steps we take to  protect this information is provided below (“Security”). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>How We Use Information and  When We May Share Information</strong></h3>
  <p><strong>Generally.</strong>&nbsp;We generally use Personal Information only for  purposes of providing and communicating with you about the Service, including  responding to your requests, making payments, notifying you of new products or  services, and otherwise communicating with you about the Service. We will not  disclose Personal Information to third parties without your consent, except as  explained in this Privacy Policy.<br clear="all">
    <br clear="all">
    <strong>Partners.</strong>&nbsp;Please note that our "Partners" (users who  provide popular content and refer other users to the Service in accordance with  our Partners Program) have access to usernames of the users they refer who also  become Partners (username only) and certain usage statistics, such as funds  earned from each referred Partners.<br clear="all">
    <br clear="all">
    <strong>Service Providers.</strong>&nbsp;From time to time, we may establish a business  relationship with other businesses whom we believe trustworthy and who have  confirmed that their privacy practices are consistent with ours ("Service  Providers"). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to  provide services such as payment processing, maintenance and support, data  storage and management, advertising, and marketing. We provide our Service  Providers with only the information necessary for them to perform these  services on our behalf. Each Service Provider must agree to use reasonable  security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information  involved, in order to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized  access, use, or disclosure. Service Providers are prohibited from using  Personal Information other than as specified by Filestrum.<br clear="all">
    <br clear="all">
    Please note that when you make payments to  Filestrum, the information you provide is submitted to a third-party payment  provider. It is not received or maintained by Filestrum, except that your  e-mail address will automatically be provided to us when you first pay for a  Premium account, so that we can establish your account and provide you with the  special features offered to Premium account holders.<br clear="all">
  <br clear="all">
    Ad Networks. We may work with third-party  advertising and marketing companies ("Ad Networks"). These companies  may collect and use information about your use of the Service in order to  provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.  Advertisements may be shown via the Services, or third-party websites. These  companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other  technologies such as Web beacons to collect information about your use of the  Service and of other Internet services and websites. Our Privacy Policy does  not cover any collection or use of information about you by any Ad Network. It  also does not cover any information that you may choose to provide to an Ad  Network or to an advertiser whose goods or services are advertised through the  Service. <br clear="all">
  <br clear="all">
  <strong>Google Analytics.</strong>&nbsp;We also uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service  provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses  "cookies," which are text files placed on your computer, to help  Filestrum analyze how users use our Service. We use this information to help us  understand how people use the Service, and to enhance the services we offer.  The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Service  (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on  servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose  of evaluating your use of the Service, compiling reports on Service activity  for us, and providing other services relating to Service activity and Internet  usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where  required to do so by law, or if such third parties process the information on  Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data  held by Google. As noted, you may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the  appropriate settings on your Web browser, but please note that if you do this  you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Service. By using the  Service, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the  manner and for the purposes set out above. For more information, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/en-GB/tos.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/analytics/en-GB/tos.html</a>.<br clear="all">
  <br clear="all">
  <strong>Standard Analytics Information.&nbsp;</strong>We may use, and disclose to third parties, certain Usage Data regarding  the Service. However, such information does not identify you individually.<br clear="all">
  <br clear="all">
  <strong>Other Transfers.</strong>&nbsp;We may share Personal Information and Usage Data with  businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Filestrum.  If Filestrum is merged, acquired, or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some  or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information and  Usage Data in connection with such transaction. You will have the opportunity  to opt-out of any such transfer if we determine, in our discretion, that the  new entity plans to handle your information in a way that differs materially  from this Privacy Policy.<br clear="all">
  <br clear="all">
  <strong>Data Retention.</strong>&nbsp;We will hold your Personal Information on our systems  for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity. If you cancel your  registration and your account is deleted Filestrum will no longer use the  Personal Information, but for administration purposes it will stay on our  system for a period of one year before being deleted.<br clear="all">
  <br clear="all">
  <strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</strong>&nbsp;Filestrum cooperates with government and law  enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.  We may disclose Personal Information and any other information about you to  government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in our  discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate for any of the following  reasons: to respond to legal requests (including court orders and subpoenas);  to protect the safety, property, or rights of Filestrum, any Filestrum user, or  any third party; to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally  actionable activity; or to comply with the law. </p>
  <p><strong>Being Careful When Sharing  Information</strong></p>
  <p>Please be aware that  whenever you share information in an uploaded file via the Service, that  information may be accessed by the recipient. That means that anyone with  access to the shared file can potentially use it for any purpose, including  potentially uploading, storing, or sharing files, sending unsolicited  communications, or redirecting payments. </p>
  <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
  <p>Filestrum is very concerned  about safeguarding the confidentiality of your Personal Information. We employ  reasonable physical and electronic measures designed to protect your  information from unauthorized access. However, no data transmission over the  Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result,  while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through the Service,  we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you upload,  store, share, transmit, or provide on or through the Service, and you do so at  your own risk. </p>
  <p><strong>Links To Content and to  Other Websites</strong></p>
  <p>Our Service permits users to  share links to materials stored on servers owned by or operated on behalf of  Filestrum. Our Service may also contain links to other websites, or allow  others to send you such links. The use of the Service to provide a link to  material on Filestrum servers or to a third party's website does not mean that  we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it. We do not exercise control  over the content uploaded and shared using the Service (except that we may  remove or disable access to it upon receipt of proper notice under our <a href="http://filestrum.com/abuse.html">Abuse  Policy Guidelines</a>). We also do  not exercise control over third-party websites. You access such content or  third-party websites at your own risk. You should always read the privacy  policy of a third-party website before providing any information to the  operator of the website. </p>
  <p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p>
  <p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from  children under the age of 13. By using our Services, you promise that you are  at least 13 years old. If we become aware that a user is under the age of 13,  we will terminate any account that user may have with Filestrum. If we become  aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a child  under the age of 13, we will permanently delete such information from our  records. </p>
