<br>
<p align="left">
<b>Updated December 18, 2003</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Our Approach to Privacy. </b>
IGN respects your privacy. Our staff, contractors and others who help us operate 
our web sites follow this policy on privacy and fair information practices for 
online activities of IGN Entertainment, Inc.<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy applies to the web sites owned by IGN Entertainment, Inc. 
including IGN.com, VaultNetwork.com, GameSages.com, GameStats.com and TeamXbox.com. 
We refer to these web sites as the <b>IGN Sites.</b><br>
<br>
While the IGN Sites offer different combinations of services and tools from one 
site to another, this policy states IGN's company-wide Privacy Policy with regard 
to data-collection practices.<br>
<br>
By registering as a member of an IGN Site, you agree to accept this Privacy Policy 
and are aware that our policy may change over time as discussed below.<br>
<br><font color="#003399"><b>	Overview of our Policy</b></font><br>
<br>
<b>The security of personal information is a high priority at IGN.</b> We maintain 
these web sites and all associated data with technical, administrative and physical 
safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, 
modification and improper disclosure. No computer system or information can ever be 
fully protected against every possible hazard. But IGN is committed to providing 
reasonable and appropriate security controls to protect our web sites and their 
information against foreseeable hazards.<br>
<br>
 The information you provide helps us, and our partners (including our service 
providers, advertisers and other partners) make the IGN Sites more fun and useful 
for you. It also enables us to provide you updates about our services and special 
offers from our partners. When you become a registered member of one of our sites, 
you may receive email or postal mail from IGN and our partners.<br>
<br>
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information in 
public areas of an IGN Site, such as the member home pages and message boards, your 
information can be viewed and possibly used by others. We advise users not to 
disclose information that can be used to contact the user ("Personally Identifiable 
information") that they do not wish for others to obtain, such as full name, home 
address, or phone number.<br>
<br><font color="#003399"><b>Changes to this Policy</b></font><br>
<br> 
This Privacy Policy will always be available to users on this page for you to read. 
We will update this privacy and fair information practices policy to reflect new 
features, services and options, as well as any other changes with regard to the use 
of personal information. Users will be notified by a notice on the IGN Site of any 
significant update to our Privacy Policy. By registering as a member of an IGN 
Site, you agree to accept this Privacy Policy and are aware that our policy may 
change over time. Continued use of the IGN Sites or other IGN services will signify 
that you agree to these changes. <br>
<br><font color="#003399"><b>	About Children</b></font><br>
<br>   
The IGN Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13. The IGN Sites 
prohibit registration by and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable 
information from anyone under 13. This requirement will be posted at points of data 
collection within the IGN Sites, such as registration for services.<br>
<br>
<b>Note to Parents. </b>If you have any concerns about the IGN Sites or its related 
services, please contact us via our online form, available at <a href="http://www.ign.com/email.html">http://www.ign.com/email.html</a>.<br>
<br><font color="#003399"><b>	Information Collection and Use</b></font><br>
<br>
Below are more details about the information the IGN Sites gather from you and how 
we use it.<br>
<br>
<b>A. Email Newsletters. </b>IGN offers email newsletters. Only registered users 
will be able to receive newsletters.  We will use your email address only to send 
you the newsletter(s)<b><i><font color="#ff0000"> </font></i></b>that you signed up 
for. If you want to update your email address or stop receiving our newsletter, 
follow the procedures to unsubscribe at the bottom of any newsletter we send you or 
simply visit <a href="http://my.ign.com">http://my.ign.com</a> to update your 
profile.<br>
<br><b>B. Membership Information. </b> When you register for membership on one of 
our sites, we ask for information about you and your interests. We do this so we 
can better understand what you like and tailor the site to suit you better. At a 
minimum, we require your name, birth date, gender, email address and zip code. The 
more information you volunteer, the more we can tailor the site and promotions to 
your interests.
</p><ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="left"><b>Service Providers.</b> We also offer our members other 
services provided by third parties such as free email and free userpages, among 
others. When you register for membership on an IGN Site or activate a service by 
clicking on a particular service link (i.e. email) on our sites, you may be 
automatically registered to receive the free services we offer and some of your 
Personally Identifiable Information may be transferred from IGN to those 
third-party service providers. By becoming a member, you authorize us and our 
third-party service providers to send you email updates and information about 
promotions and special offers. We take care to require that our third-party service 
providers only use our memberâs data as necessary to provide the particular 
service and to give you updates on that service providerâs products and 
services. 
</div>
</li>
<br>
<li>
<div align="left"><b>Co-registration with Other Sites. </b>As a member, we offer 
you the ability to co-register with select third-party partner sites. In some 
instances where IGN provides co-registration, the co-registration partners allow 
you to opt-out of their membership. If you choose to co-register with our partners 
and accept their terms of service, then you are automatically registered as a 
member of their select web sites and your Personally Identifiable Information is 
transferred to those organizations. As a result, you may<b><i><font color="#ff0000"></font></i></b>receive information from one of these web sites as 
any of their members would. We advise you to review their privacy and data 
collection policies for further information. In order to cancel your membership 
with any of these partners you will need to go directly to the partner's site. 
</div>
</li>
<br>
<li>
<div align="left"><b>Advertisers.</b>  By becoming a member, you authorize IGN to 
share your Personally Identifiable Information with our advertisers. Our 
advertisers may use your Personally Identifiable Information to send you, via email 
or postal mail, advertisements or other notices, and it is possible that your 
information may be shared with others.
</div></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<b>C. Email Updates to Members</b>. If you so elect at registration, the IGN Sites 
will periodically send you promotional email about services offered by the IGN 
Sites, our partners and advertisers. If you want to update your email address or 
stop receiving these types of promotional emails, please follow the procedures to 
unsubscribe at the bottom of any email we send you or simply visit <a href="http://my.ign.com">http://my.ign.com</a> to update your profile.<br>
<br>
The IGN Sites may contact you regarding account status, changes to the user 
agreement, and to confirm registration. <br> 
<br>
<b>D. Promotions. </b>We may ask you for Personally Identifiable Information at 
other times, including, but not limited to, when you enter sweepstakes, contests or 
promotions sponsored by a third party. If you choose to enter sweepstakes, contests 
or promotions of this nature, we may share your Personally Identifiable Information 
with the third party so they can contact you. The third party may use that 
information to send you advertisements or other notices, and it is possible that 
your information may be shared with others.<br>
<br>
<b>E. Surveys and User Research.</b> IGN conducts email and web-delivered surveys 
from time to time, as well as instant polls, to gather information about our 
audience. It is important to remember that taking these surveys and polls is 
entirely optional. You have no obligation to respond to them. We share only the 
aggregate results of these surveys, not individual data, with  our advertisers and 
partners to help them better understand our services and monitor the reach of their 
advertising on our service. We also store some of the information that our users 
provide in these surveys to help us understand your interests and to make the site 
more useful for you.<br>
<br>
 <b>F. Use of Cookies.</b> On the Internet, a "cookie" is a piece of information (a 
file) that a Web site transfers to a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. 
The use of cookies is common on the Internet. The process we use to serve 
advertisements and to track use of our site involves cookies. Cookies help IGN and 
our advertising service (discussed below) track the frequency and placement of 
advertisements. Cookies also enable us to measure aggregate, or total usage and 
traffic to our site and to specific offerings. This aids us in producing content 
that best meets our users' preferences. In order to implement new services, we may 
use other types of cookies as well. We also may use cookies to understand better 
what parts of our site you like best. We may use that information to display 
advertisements that we think will be of particular interest to you. You may 
configure your browser to reject cookies, but this may interfere with some 
functionality of the IGN Sites. To find out more about changing your browser to 
reject cookies, we suggest the EPIC Cookies Page <b>[<a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies" target="new">http://www.epic.org
/privacy/internet/cookies</a>].</b><br> 
<br>
 <b>G. Sites You Visit. </b>As you access our Affiliate Sites and browse around the 
IGN Sites, IGN may store information about which pages and which Affiliate Sites 
you visit and other information presented in your browser's URL address line. IGN 
will use this information  to help determine what our users are most interested 
in.<br>
<br>
<b>H. Other Third Parties.</b> IGN may share non-personal, aggregate, or summary, 
information regarding our users with other third parties not mentioned in this 
policy. This kind of information does not identify you individually.<br>
<br>
<b>I. Merger or Acquisition.</b> In the event of a merger, acquisition, 
reorganization, sale of all or substantially all of its assets, or the sale of an 
individual website owned by IGN, IGN may transfer your Personally Identifiable 
Information to a third party as a part of such merger, acquisition, reorganization, 
or sale.<br>
<br>
<b>J. Legal Authorities.</b> The IGN Sites may also disclose Personally 
Identifiable Information in cases when we have reason to believe that it is 
necessary to identify someone who may be violating IGN's <a href="http://corp.ign.com/user_agreement.html">User Agreement</a> or may be causing 
injury to IGN's rights or property, other users, or anyone else. The IGN Sites may 
disclose Personally Identifiable Information of our users to government authorities 
at our discretion.
<br>     
<br><font color="#003399"><b>	Access to Other Sites Through 
IGN</b><br></font><br>
<b>Our Affiliates Sites.</b> You should be aware that when you are on an IGN Site, 
you will have the opportunity to visit, or link to, other sites associated with 
IGN. These sites are identified as our "Affiliates" and/or - "Partner Sites" These 
sites are not owned or operated by IGN, but are part of a larger network of sites 
with which the IGN Sites share content and advertising opportunities. We do not 
share Personally Identifiable Information of our members with these Affiliate 
Sites.<br>
<br>
<b>Linking to Other Sites.</b> You may also visit independent web sites, not 
operated by IGN, that are connected to our network for our users. Such sites are 
operated by external, third-party service providers. Some of these sites will have 
their own separate membership processes and privacy policies. The IGN Sites do not 
control sites that are operated by others and so cannot be responsible for the 
information practices of these sites. Other sites may set their own cookies, 
collect data or solicit personal information. It is always a good idea to check the 
Privacy Policy and Terms of Use of any site before offering any of your personal 
information.<br>
<br><font color="#003399"><b>	Security</b></font><br><br> The IGN Sites use 
diligent efforts to protect the security and integrity of the information you 
provide to us once it is received on our systems. However, when you submit 
information about yourself to the IGN Sites over the Internet, the information may 
travel over many systems that are not under the control of IGN. We take the 
protection of user data very seriously and to that end provide extra assurances 
that your information will not be intercepted. In the case of shopping pages, for 
example, the credit card information you submit is protected by secure servers.<br>
<br><font color="#003399"><b>	Updating Your Information</b></font><br>
<br>
To update your account information such as your city or interests, please use the 
"Edit profile page" at the IGN Site on which you are registered. <br>
