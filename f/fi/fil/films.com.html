    <strong>FILMS MEDIA GROUP PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <br>
    Films Media Group is strongly committed to protecting your
    privacy and providing a safe online experience for all of our users while offering
    the highest quality educational media to them. Because we gather certain types of
    information about and from users so that we can fulfill your requests and better
    serve your needs, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding
    the collection and use of this information. This privacy statement discloses what
    information we gather, how we use it, how to correct or change it, and what steps
    we take to safeguard personal information provided to us both online and offline.
    Please read the complete Online Privacy Policy below, as well as our Terms and Conditions
    of Use, and contact us if you have any questions.
    <br>
    <br>
</p>
<strong>
    WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?
</strong>
<p>
    You can visit our website without giving us any personally identifiable information.
    So that we can provide our users with the most efficient, enhanced, and personalized
    service, we request information about you in certain circumstances, and also collect
    certain information automatically. We also use contact lists and other information
    we may obtain from third parties. For the convenience of our customers and to better
    serve you, a customer account includes all the collected personal information we
    may have, but you can update or correct your contact information or change your
    preferences about receiving offers and information from us at any time.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b><i>Information Users Volunteer</i></b>
    <br>
    <br>
    We collect personally identifiable information such as names, mailing addresses,
    and/or email addresses when you place an order (see the section below for more
    information on orders), or through optional, voluntary registration at our website.
    Website visitors may register to receive email updates, offers, catalogs or promotions.
    Registration may also be requested in connection with certain surveys. Registration
    can be accomplished by submitting your email address, name, address, phone number
    and institution. Our registration form will indicate what information is required
    and what information (if any) is optional. This information will be collected during
    registration on our site or in connection with specific activities (for example,
    when placing an order).
    <br>
    <br>
    <b><i>Orders</i></b>
    <br>
    <br>
    If you wish to place an order online, you must either establish a credit card account
    with us or go through a purchase order approval process. In addition to the customary
    information needed to fill your order (full name, address, ship-to name and address),
    orders necessitate collection of additional personal information, such as your credit
    card number and credit card expiration date, or your purchase order number.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b><i>Information Collected Automatically</i></b>
    <br>
    <br>
    We also may collect your IP address, browser type, access times and referring website
    address. This helps facilitate your online experience at our website. In addition,
    we may use cookies to track usage patterns at our site. See below for more detail
    on cookies.
    <br>
    <br>
</p>
<strong>
    WHAT DO WE DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION?
</strong>
<p>
    <b><i>We use information you provide to fulfill your requests and improve our products.
    </i></b>
    <br>
    <br>
    We use personal information so that we may display or send custom, personalized
    content to our website visitors and to send newsletters, mail, emails, features,
    promotional material, surveys and other updates, information or offers to our users.
    A user may, at any time, opt out of receiving such information. We also use collected
    information to evaluate and administer our products and services, fulfill customer
    requests, respond to any problems that may arise (such as delivery issues, difficulties
    in navigating our site or accessing certain features), as well as to gauge user trends
    to determine what products and services are most popular with users.
    <br>
    <br>
    Of course, we use personal information to allow you to make product purchases at
    our website. Rest assured that we and our technical and fulfillment agents and consultants
    follow careful procedures to safeguard credit card data in connection with your
    transactions.
</p>
<strong>
    HOW DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?
</strong>
<p>
    Personal information is available to Films Media Group and its technical and fulfillment
    agents and consultants who make this site and our products and services available
    to you. We share your personal information with third parties only with your prior
    permission.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b><i>Films Media Group and Its Agents</i></b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Films Media Group may access any personal information you provide for internal marketing
    purposes, including sending you notice of new publications, services or products
    we offer likely to be of interest, and filling orders. To facilitate orders, Films
    Media Group will cache your order information, and create an authorization with
    a merchant account (i.e., your credit card company) if you use a credit card to
    make a purchase. There are many companies who may be required to assist Films Media
    Group in making its products and website available to you. Web host firms and technical
    and database consultants may have access to personally identifiable information
    in the course of making our products and services available. All companies working
    for Films Media Group must comply with our information collection, use and disclosure
    policies, and are not permitted to sell your information to third parties or to
    use it except as authorized by us and you, or as permitted or required by law.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b><i>Credit Card Companies</i></b>
    <br>
    <br>
    As in any transaction, your credit card company will receive relevant information
    about the item(s) purchased, your name, and your billing address. Films Media Group
    will not otherwise provide any personal data to your credit card company.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b><i>Important Note</i></b>
    <br>
    <br>
    We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or consent
    as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request; to conduct investigations
    of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect the integrity of
    our site and our property; to protect the safety of our visitors or others; to fulfill
    your requests; or to cooperate in any legal investigation.
</p>
<strong>
    HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?
</strong>
<p>
    Your Web browser offers so-called “cookies” which, if you allow their use, store
    small amounts of data on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies do not
    contain any personally identifiable information about you and therefore cannot be
    used to identify you personally. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features
    you like best. Cookies also enable us to customize our content according to your
    preferences. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your
    browser and our websites are viewable even if you disable the cookie function on
    your browser. However, if you disable cookies, some features or offerings will not
    be available to you. For example, disabling cookies will prevent you from making
    purchases since our website shopping cart is cookie-based.
</p>
<strong>
    HOW CAN YOU CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
</strong>

    SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
</strong>
<p>
    We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt important information, such
    as your credit card data, in an effort to prevent unauthorized access during transmission
    of your orders over the Internet. We incorporate standard industry practices internally
    and with our service providers suitable to the degree of sensitivity of the information
    involved to maintain the security of your personal information and to avoid its
    disclosure except as described in this policy.

    Your personal information will also be protected by the password you created when

    You may change it anytime by following the instructions on the website. Although
    we use our best efforts to assure that your data remains secure when maintained
    by us, security during Internet transmissions cannot be assured. Films Media Group
    employees are made aware of its privacy practices through periodic communications
    and training. We limit access to personal data only to those Films Media Group employees
    or agents with a specific need to access or retrieve this information. We store

    the highest level of security, we conduct internal reviews of our security measures
    on a regular basis.
