("FileMaker") is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe
is an independent, nonprofit organization whose mission is to build
users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of
fair information practices. Because FileMaker wants to demonstrate
our commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our
information privacy practices for compliance review by TRUSTe.</p>

<p>The TRUSTe trustmark reflects our promise to tell you what
personal information we collect; the types of companies we may
share your information with; the choices available to you regarding
the collection, use, and distribution of the information; the
security procedures in place to protect the loss or misuse of
information under our control; and how you can correct inaccuracies
in the information.</p>

<p>If you have questions or concerns about FileMaker's collection,
use, or disclosure of your personal information, please email us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@filemaker.com">privacy@filemaker.com</a>.
If FileMaker doesn't respond or your inquiry hasn't been addressed
to your satisfaction, please visit the <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php" target="_blank">TRUSTe website</a> for contact information. This
certification applies to all sites under the filemaker.com domain.
However, any communications to TRUSTe must be in English.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: The TRUSTe program covers only information that is
collected through this Web site, and does not cover information
that may be collected through software downloaded from the
site.</p>
</div>

<p xmlns="">Protecting your privacy is important to FileMaker. We strive to
keep your personal information confidential. By ensuring that you
are aware of and understand the FileMaker Customer Privacy Policy,
we can provide you with better service. Please take a moment to
read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal
information.</p>

<p xmlns=""><strong>Effective on June 30, 2004</strong></p>

<h3 xmlns="">Collection of Personal Information</h3>

<p xmlns="">In order to give you superior customer service, FileMaker
collects your personal information in several ways. For example,
FileMaker may ask you to provide certain information such as your
first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), e-mail
address, employer, job title and department, telephone and
facsimile numbers, and other personal information. When ordering
products or services on the Site, you may be asked to provide a
credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the
information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory
and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data
with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to
engage in that activity.</p>

<p xmlns="">When you use the Site, FileMaker or third parties authorized by
FileMaker may also collect certain technical and routing
information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Site
and its services. For example, we may log environmental variables,
such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, and the Internet
Protocol ("IP") address of your computer. We use these
environmental variables to facilitate and track your use of the
Site and its services. FileMaker also uses such environmental
variables to measure traffic patterns on the Site. Without
expressly informing you in each particular circumstance, we do not
match such information with any of your personal information.</p>

<p xmlns="">When you submit personal information to FileMaker through this
Site, you understand and agree that this information may be
transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and
processed in any of the countries in which FileMaker and its
affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices, including without
limitation, the United States. You also acknowledge that in certain
countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection,
transferring, storage and processing of your information may be
undertaken by trusted vendors of FileMaker. Such vendors are bound
by contract to not use your personal information for their own
purposes or provide it to any third parties. One instance where
this could occur is in conjunction with framed pages in which the
URL for the pages is not visible and the pages are being hosted by
a vendor of FileMaker.</p>

<p xmlns="">FileMaker has established relationships with various service
providers whose services are available to you from this Site or
from web sites that are linked to this Site. Unless expressly
provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide
while you are visiting a provider?s web site will be subject to the
privacy policy posted on such site and personal information that
you provide while on this Site in conjunction with a provider?s
service will be subject to this Privacy Policy. In the situation
where sites have a FileMaker ?look and feel,? and you reasonably
believe you are on a FileMaker site, the site is collecting
information in a solely intermediary capacity and does not use
personal information for secondary purposes.</p>

<p xmlns="">In order to reduce errors in our database, authenticate our
users and prevent abuse of our system we may on occasion supplement
the personal information you submit to us with information from
third party sources. For example, we may supplement your
registration information with address information provided by the
U.S. Postal Service to qualify your information and prevent errors
in our database.</p>

<h3 xmlns="">How Your Personal Information is Used</h3>

<p xmlns="">FileMaker uses your personal information for several purposes
including:</p>

<ul xmlns="">
<li>To ensure our Site is relevant to your needs.</li>

<li>To deliver services, such as newsletters, events, training or
software, that you request or purchase.</li>

<li>To help us create and publish content most relevant to
you.</li>

<li>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated
information and other new services from FileMaker.</li>

<li>To allow you access to limited-entry areas of our Site as
appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<h3 xmlns="">When We Disclose Personal Information</h3>

<p xmlns="">Because FileMaker is a global company, your personal information
may be shared with other FileMaker business affiliates around the
world. They will protect your personal information in accordance
with the FileMaker Customer Privacy Policy. FileMaker may
occasionally share your personal contact information with carefully
selected companies, to keep you informed about related products and
services. If you do not want to receive promotional information
from FileMaker or other companies and wish to opt-out, visit the <a href="../../opt_out.html">FileMaker Communications Web Page</a>.</p>

<p xmlns="">FileMaker works with other companies that help us provide
FileMaker products and services to you, and we may provide your
personal information to these companies. For example, we give
shipping companies this information so they can deliver your
products efficiently. The information they receive is for shipping
and delivery purposes only, and we require that the companies
safeguard your personal information in accordance with FileMaker's
policies.</p>

<p xmlns="">FileMaker may disclose your personal information if required to
do so by law or legal process. We may also disclose information
about you if we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect the
personal safety of FileMaker employees, users of FileMaker products
or services, or members of the public.</p>

<h3 xmlns="">How We Protect your Personal Information</h3>

<p xmlns="">FileMaker is committed to protecting the security of your
personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and
procedures to help protect your personal information from
unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, the FileMaker
Store uses industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption
on all web pages where personal information is required. To make
purchases from the FileMaker Store, you must use an SSL-enabled
browser such as Netscape Navigator 7.x, Safari 1.0 or Internet
Explorer 5 — 6.x. This protects the confidentiality of your
personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over
the Internet.</p>

<p xmlns="">We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal
data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use
a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a
secure browser.</p>

<h3 xmlns="">Access to Your Personal Information/Opt-Out Choices</h3>

<p xmlns="">You have access to the information we have about you. To review
and update your personal information, contact <a href="../../contact.html#customerassistance">FileMaker Customer
Service</a>.</p>

<p xmlns="">If you receive communications about FileMaker-related products
and services and wish to opt-out, visit the FileMaker
Communications Web Page at <a href="../../opt_out.html">http://www.filemaker.com/company/opt_out.html</a>,
send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:remove@filemaker.com">remove@filemaker.com</a> or call
our Customer Service department at toll-free (800) 325-2747.</p>

<h3 xmlns="">Collecting Other Personal Information</h3>

<p xmlns="">When you browse FileMaker's website, you are able to do so
anonymously. Generally, we don't collect personal information when
you browse — not even your email address. Your browser, however,
does automatically tell us the type of computer and operating
system you are using.<br>
<br>
 Like many websites, the FileMaker website uses "cookie"
technology. When you first connect to our site, the cookie
identifies your browser with a unique, random number. The cookies
we use do not reveal any personal information about you. Cookies
help us understand which parts of our websites are the most
popular, where our visitors are going, and how long they spend
there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns on our site so we
can make the site even better.<br>
<br>
 In some of our email to you, we use a "click-through URL." When
you click one of these URLs, you may pass through our web server
before arriving at the website that is your destination. We may
track click-throughs to help us determine your interest in
particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer
communications.</p>

<h3 xmlns="">Clear Gifs, Log Files, and Action Tags</h3>

<p xmlns="">FileMaker employs a software technology called clear gifs
(a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content
on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs
are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to
cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are
invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the
period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to
users' personally identifiable information.</p>

<p xmlns="">FileMaker also uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer
the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic
information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to
personally identifiable information.</p>

<p xmlns="">From time to time, we may use third parties to serve ads on our
behalf across the Internet. These third parties may also collect
anonymous information about your visits to our web Site. This is
primarily accomplished through the use of a technology device,
commonly referred to as a Web beacon or an Action Tag, which we
place on various web pages within our web ite that allows third
parties to collect anonymous information, which cannot be used to
identify you personally. These third parties may use information
about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide
ads about goods and services of interest to you.</p>

<p xmlns="">The third parties report the anonymous data that they collect on
our behalf back to us, which we link to our customer's personally
identifiable information for the purposes of better serving you.
When we merge this data, it is treated under this policy as
personally identifiable information as described above.</p>

<h3 xmlns="">Public Forums</h3>

<p xmlns="">This site makes forums and news groups available to its users.
Please remember that some information that is disclosed in these
areas may become public information and you should exercise caution
when deciding to disclose your personal information.</p>

<h3 xmlns="">Our Companywide Commitment to Privacy</h3>

<p xmlns="">To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we
communicate these privacy guidelines to every FileMaker employee.
In addition, FileMaker participates in industry initiatives to
preserve privacy rights on the Internet and in all aspects of
electronic commerce.</p>

<p xmlns="">FileMaker does not knowingly solicit personal information from
children or send them requests for personal information.</p>

<p xmlns="">FileMaker's website contains links to other sites. FileMaker
does not share your personal information with those websites and is
not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to
learn about the privacy policies of those companies.</p>

<p xmlns="">If we are going to use your personal information differently
from that stated at the time of collection, we will try to contact
you via email using the most recent information we have. If you
have not given us permission to communicate with you, you will not
be contacted, nor will we use your personal information in a new
manner.</p>

<p xmlns="">The FileMaker Customer Privacy Policy is subject to change at
any time. We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly
for any changes.</p>
