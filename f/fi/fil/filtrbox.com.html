		<div class="post content wide">

				
				Filtrbox, Inc. (“Filtrbox”, “we”, the "Service") was designed to help you and your company monitor and discover new articles and content from online sources that matters to your business, and we recognize the sensitivity of the data entered into the Service. We are committed to protecting the privacy of your data, and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure tools possible. We greatly appreciate your trust that we will protect your information carefully and sensibly.
				<p> </p>
				When you register for Filtrbox, you are given an account with the Filtrbox service, (your "Account"). All information you enter on Filtrbox.com when registering and information on your Account is subject to this privacy policy.
					<p> </p>
				This Privacy Policy describes Filtrbox’s use of Personal Information and Anonymous Information that we collect when you use Filtrbox. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the use of your Personal Information by third parties that Filtrbox does not own or control, or to individuals that we do not control or manage.
					<p> </p>
				“Personal Information” is information about you that is personally identifiable to you like your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing.
				“Anonymous Information” means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information; Anonymous Information does not permit the identification of individual persons.
					<p> </p>
				We collect and use Personal Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy Policy from the visitors of our Website, and from the registered users of Filtrbox Services (“Users”).
					<p> </p>
				BY USING THE FILTRBOX SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. 
					<p> </p>
				YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY. 
					<p> </p>
			<p>	Information Collection and Usage</p>
				We require customers who register to use Filtrbox on Filtrbox.com to give us certain contact information, such as their full name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial information for paid versions of the Service, such as billing name and address, and a credit card number. Additionally, we do automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you request.
					<p> </p>
				Information entered by you and all users of your Account is secure and confidential, and your specific data, including personal information, search terms, results, and article feedback will never be published in conjunction with your account information. Certain records may be viewed by select staff only for the purpose of resolving a technical problem or as may be required by law in response to a subpoena. We will never sell or share any personal or company information with any third parties or other Accounts. All information you enter on your Account is private to you and any users to whom you grant access. 
					<p> </p>
				Filtrbox may collect and publish statistics and usage information related to the Users consumption and feedback of content only in Anonymous Information cases. We may publish consumption data associated with a certain keyword or piece of content, but never in relationship to your Account.  We may collect certain information from visitors to Filtrbox.com and users of the Service, such as Internet addresses. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems and prevent security breaches. 
					<p> </p>
				As we continue to develop our business, we may participate in corporate transactions such as mergers and acquisitions, and it is possible that another company may acquire Filtrbox, Inc. or its business assets in the future. In such cases, user information may be shared with the acquirer and/or other reputable parties involved in those transactions. Users will be notified in advance via email or a prominent notice on our Web site if information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
					<p> </p>
				<p>Cookies</p>
				Filtrbox uses "cookies" to improve the experience of the Service. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server, often including an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.<br>
				We primarily use cookies to record current login information, but you are still required to log in to your Account after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents. Some cookies stored by the Service last for longer periods, and store information such as preferences on how data should appear on an Account. We do not store any sensitive information such as passwords in cookies with a long expiration period. 
					<p> </p>
			<p>	Security</p>
				We treat the security of your information as a top priority. We use a secure server hosting location, firewall protection, controlled access and secure data storage to protect your data. We do not store your passwords in plaintext, nor do we store your credit card information on our systems. The Filtrbox.com site fully supports SSL and current encryption standards. We also limit access to your data to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to investigate a technical problem. While no system is guaranteed to be completely secure, we work hard to ensure our security measures protect all information in a responsible manner and use the most advanced technologies available today. 
					<p> </p>
			<p>	Revisions</p>
				We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy, and will notify users via email or a prominent notice on each Account at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of any material changes to this Privacy Policy.<br>
				Any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy should be addressed via email to: support (at) filtrbox.com.
