					<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			Filtrbox, Inc. (“Filtrbox,” “Us,” or ”We” ) is committed to protecting the privacy of the users of the <a href="http://www.filtrbox.com">www.filtrbox.com</a> web site (the “Site”).  The Site was designed to help you and your company monitor and discover new articles and content from online sources that matter to your business.  This privacy policy (the “Policy”) discloses Filtrbox’s information privacy practices for the Site and is intended to inform registered users and other visitors to the Site of the data collection and use practices of the Site.  
				<p> </p>
BY USING THE SITE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.  YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.
					<p> </p>
Amendments to this Policy will be posted on the Site and will be effective when posted.  Your continued use of the Site following the posting of any amendment will constitute your acceptance of that amendment, except if your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner.  See the Notification of Changes section below for further information.  <p> </p>
					If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy, you should contact Filtrbox by e-mail at 'privacy [at] filtrbox.com'.
					<p> </p>
<strong>Registered Users</strong>
					<br>
Registration is not mandatory to access certain public areas of the Site.  Registration is, however, required for access to certain areas of the Site and the products and services provided through those areas of the Site.  When you register for Filtrbox, you are given an account with the Filtrbox service (your "<strong>Account</strong>") and will chose a username and password for purposes of accessing your Account and the portions of the Site available to registered users.   Filtrbox is not responsible for any loss or misuse of your username and password.  Always remember that in order to protect your privacy you should not share your username and password with others.
					<p> </p>
<strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>		
					<br>
					We collect and share personally identifiable information regarding users of the Site as described in this Policy.  Except as noted in this Policy, personally identifiable information collected on this Site is not shared with third parties without your consent.
					<p> </p>
					We may automatically collect personally identifiable information from you when you access the Site.  We may also collect personally identifiable information from you through a number of voluntary sources on the Site, such as emails, postings, messages or other electronic submissions and communications sent by you to Filtrbox or the Site.
					<p> </p>
					The personally identifiable information we may collect from you will include, by way of example: 
					<ul>
						<li>Full name;</li>
						<li>Company name;</li>
						<li>Contact information (including, address, zip code, country, and phone number);</li>
						<li>E-mail address;</li>
						<li>Financial information (including, billing name and address, and credit card numbers);</li>
						<li>Other information volunteered by users, such as information provided during surveys and Site registration;</li>
						<li>IP address;</li>
						<li>User specific and aggregate information on the areas of the Site accessed; and </li>
						 <li>User name and password information for the Site.</li>
						</ul>
					<p> </p>
YOU SHOULD NOT PROVIDE FILTRBOX WITH ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (OR SUBMIT OR POST ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO THE SITE) UNLESS YOU WOULD LIKE THAT INFORMATION TO BE USED BY FILTRBOX IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS POLICY.  LIKEWISE, YOU SHOULD NOT SUBMIT OR POST ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO THE SITE UNLESS YOU WANT THAT INFORMATION TO BE ACCESSIBLE BY OTHER USERS OF THE SITE, AS INFORMATION POSTED ON THE SITE MAY BE MADE AVAILABLE TO OTHER USERS OF THE SITE.  
					<p> </p>
The personally identifiable information that Filtrbox collects from users of the Site (both registered and unregistered) may be used for a variety of purposes, for example to provide the services and products offered through the Site to users of the Site, to customize content and/or layout of the Site for each individual user of the Site, to notify users of the Site about updates to and activities on the Site and about goods and services that we feel may be of interest to you, to improve the content of the Site, to analyze data and patterns regarding usage of the Site, to contact users of the Site for marketing purposes, and to contact users of the Site for information verification purposes.  
					<p> </p>
We may also share certain personally identifiable information we collect through the Site with third party companies so that they may offer products and services to users of our Site that we believe will be of interest to those users.  We may also share certain personally identifiable information with third party advertisement serving companies to better target the advertising displayed on the Site and provide pertinent offers we think may be of interest to our users.  In addition, third party advertisers may receive certain personally identifiable information about you if you click on advertisements displayed on the Site (and clicking on any advertisement displayed on the Site will be considered your consent to “opt in” for this transfer).  
					<p> </p>
				Filtrbox may collect and publish statistics and usage information related to the Users consumption and feedback of content only in Anonymous Information cases. We may publish consumption data associated with a certain keyword or piece of content, but never in relationship to your Account.  We may collect certain information from visitors to Filtrbox.com and users of the Service, such as Internet addresses. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems and prevent security breaches. 
					<p> </p>
<strong>Disclosure as Required by Law</strong>
					<br>
					Though we make every reasonable effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personally identifiable information of certain users of the Site when we have a reasonable and good-faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order, or legal process served on Filtrbox or the Site.  In this situation we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of this disclosure to all affected users, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances.  
					<p> </p>
<strong>Enhancement of Personal Information</strong>
				<br>	
				We may enhance our user database information with third party data to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers we think our users would be interested in.  Certain summary demographics are also used in our research product offerings.  Individual personally identifiable information is never used in our research product offering and is never tied back to an individual user or resold for any purposes.  
					<p> </p>
<strong>Service Announcements</strong>
					<br>On occasion it is necessary to send out service related announcements.  For instance, if the Site or any of the services offered through the Site are temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.  Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account.  These communications are not promotional in nature.
					<p> </p>
<strong>Special Offers and Updates</strong>
We send all new registrants of the Site a welcoming email to verify password and username.  Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services and special deals, and periodic newsletters.
				<p> </p>
			
<strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>
				<br>
Where possible, our server automatically recognizes each visitor’s Internet Protocol addresses.  We also collect information about how visitors use the Site (for example what pages are viewed and products and services are purchased).  This information, which is collected and maintained in anonymous and in a non-personally identifiable form, allows us to improve the content of the Site and facilitate market research.  Sometimes, we utilize the services of a third party to help us understand this information better, although the information that is disclosed to these entities remains at all times in anonymous and non-personally identifiable form.  Other than improving the Site and the experience of visitors to the Site, we make no other use of this information.
				<p> </p>
<strong>Transfer of Information</strong>
				<br>
				As we continue to develop our business, we may participate in corporate transactions such as mergers and acquisitions, and it is possible that another company may acquire Filtrbox, Inc. or its business assets in the future. If Filtrbox elects, in its reasonable discretion, to transfer ownership or control of the Site to a third party, whether or not in the context of an acquisition of Filtrbox or a merger of Filtrbox with a third party, you consent to the transfer of your personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information to that third party, provided that all use of your information by that third party remains subject to the terms of this Policy.
					<p> </p>
<strong>Cookies</strong>
					<br>
					Filtrbox uses "cookies" to improve the experience of the Site. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server, often including an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
					<br>
					We may use cookies for various purposes, for example, to save user preferences, customize Site content for individual users, to ensure that users are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, to record session information, such as items that users add to their shopping cart, to alert users to new areas that might be of interest upon return to the Site, and to save certain information about users of the Site and others who visit the Site. We also use cookies to record current login information; however, you are still required to log in to your Account after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your Account.  
					<p> </p>
<strong>Access, Review, Update</strong>
					<br>Users may review, delete/deactivate and update the personal information that was previously provided to us by changing their individual user profile which may be accessed by logging into the Filtrbox dashboard at <a href="http://www.filtrbox.com">http://www.filtrbox.com</a> or by emailing us at 'support [at] filtrbox.com'.
					<p> </p>
					<strong>Other Web Sites; Links</strong>
					<br>
					Third-party web sites may be accessible through this Site.  These third party web sites have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.  Filtrbox is not responsible for any actions or privacy policies of such third parties.  You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing personally identifiable information through linked web sites.  
					<p> </p>
					<strong>Consent to the Use of Third Party Providers</strong>
					<br>
					In addition to the specific third parties noted in this Policy, Filtrbox may also contract with other third parties to provide various services to Filtrbox relating to the Site on an outsourced basis rather than performing the services itself.  For example, Filtrbox may contract with an email provider to handle the distribution of email messages to members of the Site.  Likewise, Filtrbox may contract with a web site hosting provider to host all or a portion of the Site for Filtrbox.  By visiting the Site, all visitors consent to Filtrbox providing both personal and non-personal information received from those visitors to these third party providers for the purpose of enabling the third party provider to provide these outsourced services to Filtrbox.  In addition, all visitors consent to the collection, maintenance, and processing of their personal and non-personal information by Filtrbox and these third party providers.
					<p> </p>
					<strong>Notification of Changes</strong>
					<br>If we decide to change the Policy, we will either notify users by way of an email or post material changes on the Site so our users are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and if we disclose it.  Unless we seek and receive your consent, we will use information in accordance with the Policy under which the information was last collected. Users may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by emailing us at 'privacy [at] filtrbox.com'. 
					<p> </p>
				
					<strong>Security</strong>
					<br>We will use at least industry standard measures on the Site to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control. We use a secure server hosting location, firewall protection, controlled access and secure data storage to protect your data.  We do not store your passwords in plaintext, nor do we store your credit card information on our systems.  The Site fully supports SSL and current encryption standards.  We also limit access to your data to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information.  While no system is guaranteed to be completely secure, we work hard to ensure our security measures protect all information in a responsible manner. 
					<p> </p>
				<strong>Contact Information</strong>
					<br>Any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy should be addressed via email to: privacy [at] filtrbox.com.
