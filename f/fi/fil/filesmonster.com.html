            <h3>Privacy policy</h3>
            <div>
                <p>This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personally identifiable information is collected, used
                    and disclosed by FilesMonster.com , ("we" or "us") with respect to your access and use
                    of FilesMonster.com 's service located at FilesMonster.com, (the "Service"), so you
                    can make an informed decision about using the Service.</p>
                <h4>What Is Personal Information?</h4>
                <p>As used in this Policy, the term "personally identifiable information" means information that
                    specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, user name or e-mail address), or information
                    about that individual that is directly linked to information that specifically identifies an
                    individual. Personally identifiable information does not include "aggregate" information, which is
                    data we collect about the use of the Service or about a group or category of services or users, from
                    which individual identities or other personally identifiable information has been removed. This
                    Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>
                <h4>What Information Do We Collect?</h4>
                <p><b>Active Collection:</b> We collect information from you in various ways when you use the Service.
                    For example, we collect information: (i) that you voluntarily provide to us (such as when you send
                    us an email); and (ii) to which you provide us access. Such information may include personal
                    information, such as your name, email address, social network data and performance related data.</p>
                <p><b>Passive Collection:</b> When you use the Service, some information is also automatically
                    collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the
                    address of a referring website, and your activity on the Service. We may also automatically collect
                    certain logistical information in server logs, including information about how you use various
                    features of the Service and information about the number, frequency and length of each session. We
                    may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies" when you use the
                    Service. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website. Among
                    other things, cookies help us to improve the Service and your experience. If we link cookies to any
                    personally identifiable information, we will treat this information as personally identifiable
                    information. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser
                    manufacturer to learn about these functions. However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies,
                    this could affect certain features or services made available via the Service.</p>
                <p>The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or
                    control over these cookies.</p>
                <p>We may use Web beacons or similar technology on the Service. We do not tie the information gathered
                    by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. Web beacons are small,
                    invisible graphic images that may be used on the Service or in emails relating to the Service to
                    collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Service, such as to count visits,
                    understand usage effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. Such
                    technologies are used to collect aggregate statistics related to usage of the Service and do not
                    collect personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information will be stored on
                    secured servers.</p>
                <h4>How Do We Use the Personally Identifiable Information We Collect?</h4>
                <p>We use personally identifiable information collected through the Service for the purposes described
                    in this Policy or elsewhere on the Service. For example, we may use personally identifiable
                    information we collect:<br>
                    • to process and complete any transactions in connection with the Service;<br>
                    • to request feedback and to otherwise contact you about your use of the Service;<br>
                    • to respond to your emails, questions, comments, requests and complaints, and to provide customer
                    service;<br>
                    • to monitor and analyze Service usage and trends;<br>
                    • to personalize and improve the Service, and our users' experiences with the Service (such as
                    providing content or features that match interests), and to increase the Service's functionality and
                    user friendliness;<br>
                    • to send you confirmations, updates, security alerts, additional information about our products and

                    lawful requests or legal authorities including, but not limited to, responding to lawful subpoenas,
                    warrants, or court orders;<br>
                    • when we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing
                    so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety
                    of FilesMonster.com, our users, our employees, copyright owners, third-parties or the public
                    including, but not limited to, protecting FilesMonster.com. or our users from fraudulent,

                <p>We are not responsible for the actions of Service Providers or other third-parties, nor are we
                    responsible for any additional information you provide directly to any other users or third-
                    parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with third-party privacy practices before
                    disclosing information directly to any such third-parties. Nothing herein restricts the sharing of

                    privacy policy. This Policy does not apply to such linked websites, and we are not responsible for
                    the content or privacy and security practices and policies of these websites or any other websites

                <h4>What Steps Do We Take To Protect Your Information Online?</h4>
                <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personally identifiable information in an effort to
                    prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be
                    aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no
                    method of data transmission can guarantee against any interception or any other type of misuse. To
                    assist with the protection of personally identifiable information, you must keep your password
                    confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the
                    Service by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password
                    has been misused. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions
                    about security on our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@filesmonster.com">support@filesmonster.com</a>.
