            <p>Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. Because we 
              gather certain types of information about the users of FileHeap!'s network of 
              sites and services, we feel you should fully understand the terms and 
              conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy 
              statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to 
              correct or change it.</p>
            <p><b>Information FileHeap! Gathers and Tracks<br>
              </b>
            </p>
            <p>FileHeap! gathers three types of information about users: data that users 
              provide through optional, voluntary registrations and in certain contests and 
              sweepstakes; FileHeap! gathers through aggregating tracking information derived 
              mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites and click through on our 
              newsletters. Such information enables us to better tailor our content to 
              readers' needs and to help our advertisers better understand the demographics 
              of our audience. Because FileHeap! derives its revenue mainly from advertising, 
              providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service 
              free to users. The only situation in which FileHeap! divulges information about 
              an individual user to a third party is with certain contests and 
              sweepstakes--and then, only with the user's express consent.</p>
            <p>FileHeap! gathers user information in the following processes:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><b>Optional Registration</b></p>
              <p>FileHeap! sites offer free, voluntary registration to users. By registering, 
                users can enter FileHeap! without having to log on each time; they gain access 
                to the polling area; and they can take advantage of personalization (the 
                ability to select content according to a user-supplied profile).</p>
              <p>During registration the user is required to supply a username, password, and 
                email address, and must answer mandatory survey questions about age, gender, 
                income, Internet connection, zip code, country, employment status, and other 
                employment information.</p>
              <p>During registration the user has the option of supplying a first name, last 
                name, and password hint. In addition, the user can opt to subscribe to various 
                FileHeap! electronic newsletters and to have his or her email address and/or 
                URL appear in postings.</p>
              <p><b>Polling</b></p>
              <p>FileHeap! sites offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share 
                their opinions with other users and see what the FileHeap! audience thinks 
                about important issues. FileHeap! uses a system to "tag" users after 
                they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag 
                is not correlated with information about individual users.</p>
              <p><b>Electronic Newsletters</b></p>
              <p>FileHeap! offers a free electronic newsletter to users. FileHeap! gathers the 
                email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves 
                from this mailing list through the subscription management pages. Users can 
                also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration.</p>
              <p>FileHeap! delivers newsletters, marketing and product offerings via email to 
                only registered recipients from our subscription center. The email tracking 
                system recognizes the URL that was clicked, and records some information about 
                you and your computer, such as the email address that you provided to us, the 
                browser, operating system and IP address.</p>
              <p>FileHeap! also uses the feature of your browser to set a "cookie" on 
                your system. This allows us to measure and report the click through rate on 
                e-mails delivered and them better determine future content.</p>
              <p>While aggregate counts of click through behavior are provided to advertisers, 
                an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. FileHeap! 
                does not target advertising against specific user information. FileHeap! will 
                not provide specific user information to any third party company.</p>
              <p><b>Surveys</b></p>
              <p>Occasionally FileHeap! conducts user surveys to better target our content to 
                our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in 
                these surveys with our advertisers and partners. We never share any of this 
                information about specific individuals with any third party.</p>
              <p><b>Contests and Sweepstakes</b></p>
              <p>FileHeap! offers contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal 
                information. At a minimum, the required information includes name and email 
                address; in some cases, the user must answer mandatory survey questions about a 
                range of other personal data. The information gathered in the entry form is 
                used to verify the entrant's identity, to send the entrant an email 
                notification that their entry has been received, and to contact winners and/or 
                prize recipients. There are two situations in which FileHeap! will divulge this 
                information to a third party--provided the user gives express consent:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>1. A user may expressly choose to receive additional information from the 
                  contest sponsor, in which case the user's personally identifiable information 
                  is divulged to the advertiser.</p>
                <p>2. Some of the contests may be hosted on the FileHeap! site but administered 
                  by the sponsor; in such cases, the information a user provides is passed on to 
                  the third party as long as that user gives express consent.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Because the rules and terms of each contest can vary, all information about 
                each contest is clearly posted during the event. All contests and sweepstakes 
                are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and state laws.</p>
              <p><b>Usage Tracking</b></p>
              <p>FileHeap! tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites.</p>
              <p>FileHeap! sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enters, 
                but this tracking is never associated with individual users.</p>
              <p><b>Clear GIFs</b></p>
              <p>On occasion, FileHeap! uses clear GIFs to track user traffic patterns. 
                FileHeap! does not aggregate or track personally identifiable information when 
                using clear GIFs, only usage patterns.</p>
              <p><b>Cookies</b></p>
              <p>
              A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive 
              when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID 
              that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal 
              information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie 
              can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. 
              FileHeap! uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above), 
              when you register as a FileHeap! member, and when you click an ad:
              </p><p>Registration: when you register, FileHeap! uses a cookie to store a unique, 
                random user ID. We do not store passwords or any personal information about 
                you. We use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database and to track 
                the pages you visit on our site. Cookies also enable you to enter FileHeap! 
                sites as a member without having to log on each time, and to visit 
                member-restricted areas of the sites. We encrypt the user ID for added 
                security.</p>
              <p>Ads: FileHeap!'s advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track 
                ad impressions and click rates.</p>
              <p><b>Opt-in Email Newsletters</b></p>
              <p>FileHeap! offers free email newsletters to users in association with 
                NetCreations PostMasterDirect, an independent company that creates targeted 
                email newsletters to announce various products and services. When users 
                subscribe to a FileHeap! newsletter, they are given the opportunity to opt in, 
                or join, announcement lists administered by PostMasterDirect. If users choose 
                to opt in for an announcement list, they will receive email newsletters from 
                third parties via PostMasterDirect on topics selected by the users. Users may 
                have their email addresses removed from the opt-in announcement lists at any 
                time by following the instructions printed in the email newsletters.</p>
              <p><b>Third-Party Ad Servers</b></p>
              <p>Sometimes we use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our sites. 
                These third-party advertising companies employ cookie technology to measure ad 
                effectiveness. To do so, these companies may use information about your visits 
                to our sites and other Web sites. Unless you are otherwise notified, these 
                advertising companies do not use names, addresses, email addresses, or 
                telephone numbers, and they do not link any online actions or cookies to an 
                identifiable person. Use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy 
                policies. If you would like more information about the privacy policies of the 
                third-party advertisers on FileHeap!'s sites, including information on how to 
                opt out of their cookies, check their sites:</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><b>Use of the Information</b></p>
            <p>FileHeap! uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their 
              experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or 
              personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on 
              the interests of our users.</p>
            <p>As stated above, FileHeap! uses information that users voluntarily provide in 
              order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in 
              polls, contests, message boards, and auctions. We send out newsletters to 
              subscribers on a regular schedule (daily or weekly, depending on the 
              newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we think 
              subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. 
              FileHeap! never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, 
              including advertisers or partners. When we use tracking information to 
              determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic 
              to those areas. FileHeap! does not track what individual users read, but rather 
              how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better 
              service for you. We track search terms entered as one of many measures of what 
              interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters. 
              FileHeap! creates aggregrate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns 
              for advertisers and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more 
              effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent 
              to their needs. Data submitted through registration for opt-in email 
              announcement newsletters are provided to PostMasterDirect so that it can 
              deliver the announcements requested by users. This information is never shared 
              with third parties, including the third parties that send announcements through 
              PostMasterDirect. PostMasterDirect and FileHeap! may use aggregated data 
              regarding users' responses to the opt-in email announcement newsletters program 
              to improve the service and to provide information to the companies sending the 
              opt-in email announcements and to other advertisers.</p>
            <p><b>Sharing of the Information</b></p>
            <p>FileHeap! uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit 
              your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's 
              demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. We do not share 
              information about individual users with any third party, except in the case of 
              some contests and sweepstakes--and then, only with a user's express consent. 
              FileHeap! may make registration records and log files available on a 
              confidential basis to third-party auditors and to select measurement and 
              analysis firms.</p>
            <p>FileHeap! does not control the practices of our advertisers. If you have 
              questions about how one of our advertisers uses information about you when you 
              click their ad and go to their content, please contact them directly. 
              (FileHeap! will divulge information only as necessary to comply with state and 
              federal laws.)</p>
            <p><b>Delete/Deactivate Policy</b></p>
            <p>Users may unsubscribe to any of our electronic newsletters at any time by 
              following the instructions contained at the end of every newsletter.</p>
            <p>Currently, FileHeap! does not offer users a means by which to completely 
              delete personal information established at the time of registration for 
              FileHeap!.</p>
