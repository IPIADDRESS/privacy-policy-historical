    <h3 class="new_software_title">FileHeap Privacy Policy</h3>
				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence.</p>
				<p>We have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This privacy policy describes how FileHeap collects information from all end users of FileHeap's Internet services (the "Services")�those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members")�what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. FileHeap requests that you read this privacy policy carefully.</p>
				<h2>Personal Information FileHeap Collects and How It Is Used</h2>
				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>FileHeap collects information in different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Services and, generally, do not share this information with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special cases described below. 
				</p><h4>Registration</h4>
				<p>Members are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. However, in instances where FileHeap and a partner jointly promote the Services, FileHeap may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. FileHeap may also generate nonidentifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and nonidentifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.</p>
				<h4>FileHeap partners and Sponsors</h4>
				<p>Some FileHeap products and services are offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with a non-affiliated partner. For example, we outsource the provision of stock quotes and operation of your stock portfolio (accessible through your <b>personal Start page</b>) to a third-party vendor. To provide Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal information. In these instances, you will be notified before any such data is collected or transferred and may decide not to use that particular service or feature. Additionally, many FileHeap Members have cobranded <b>personal Start pages</b> that are cosponsored by nonaffiliated partners. FileHeap will share nonidentifying and aggregate information (except as described above), but not personal information, with such partners in order to administer the cobranded products or services offered.</p>
				<h4>Online Shopping</h4>
				<p>At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or register to receive materials, such as a catalog or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card information. If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone number. FileHeap has no control over the third parties' use of any personal information you provide when placing such an order. please exercise care when doing so.</p>
				<p>If you order products directly from FileHeap, such as through the "FileHeap Store," we will use the personal information you provide only to process that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.</p>
				<h4>Online Advertisements</h4>
				<p>FileHeap displays our online advertisements. We share aggregated and nonidentifying information about our Visitors and Members collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and nonidentifying information to deliver tailored advertisements. For instance, an advertiser tells us the audience they want to reach (for example, males between 25 and 55 years of age) and provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and nonidentifying information we have collected, we may then display the advertisement to the intended audience. FileHeap does not share personal information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers.</p>
				<h4>Responses to email Inquiries</h4>
