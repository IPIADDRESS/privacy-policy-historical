There are a few special cases, as follows:</p><h3 class="css-rv324f-Heading em4arlq0">1.1	For users in the EEA</h3><p class="css-1oblyum-P e1ccqnho0">The EEA—which stands for the <em class="css-u6hpqs-Italic">European Economic Area</em>—includes the members states of the European Union and Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. Users in or from those countries have rights under the regulation for that region, the General Data Protection Regulation (known as the “GDPR”) including, for example, having us change or remove all or part of the Personal Information we hold.</p><p class="css-1oblyum-P e1ccqnho0">For those users, this Privacy Policy applies and incorporates into it the privacy provisions at <a href="https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/14961855/legal" class="css-1psntrz">Vocal GDPR Privacy Terms</a>. If you are such a user then you must consent to those terms by clicking <a href="https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/14961855/legal" class="css-1psntrz">here</a>. For EEA users, if there are any conflicts between the provisions at that link and the provisions of this Privacy Policy below, then the provisions at that link will prevail.

We do not knowingly receive or receive Personal Information from anyone under 13 and will delete such information if we learn about it. If you become aware that your child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information or created an account, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@vocal.media" class="css-1psntrz">info@vocal.media</a>.</p><p class="css-1oblyum-P e1ccqnho0">Under California law, individuals under 18 who are users have rights of removal of Personal Information about them. If you are—or your child is—under 18 and there is an account in your name (or the name of that child), then on request the Personal Information can be removed by emailing at the address above. Please understand that we will have to verify your request, which might mean that we will contact you. Please also note that such removal might not be comprehensive because, for example, relevant User Content has been re-posted elsewhere or because the Personal Information is in archives and backups maintained for purposes noted above. </p><h3 class="css-rv324f-Heading em4arlq0">1.3	Notice to California Users:  Your Privacy Rights</h3><p class="css-1oblyum-P e1ccqnho0">California has passed privacy laws that apply to us and those laws require the disclosure below.

That law applies to our Sites because they are accessible in California. The law (at Civil Code Section 1798.83) gives California users the right to prevent us from disclosing their Personal Information to third parties that use such information for their direct marketing purposes. The law also requires certain companies to respond to California users requests to disclose business’ practices related to disclosing Personal Information to third parties for those direct marketing purposes. As an alternative, companies subject to the “Shine the Light Law” can have in place a policy of not disclosing Personal Information for such marketing purposes.<!-- -->We don’t share any such Personal Information. Period. We have a policy against it (so that would be the third alternative above).</li><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">B. California’s Law on “Online Erasure”: </strong>California also has another law that applies to us, which is known as the “Online Erasure” law (at Business and Professions Code Sections 22580-22582). That law requires companies of certain websites and online services (i.e., us) to allow registered users who are under the age of 18 and residents of California to request removal of User Content they post. Companies can delete it or make it invisible to others.<!-- -->As noted elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we will remove such Content in response to any user’s request to remove User Content (and also Personal Information), provided, of course, that we can validate you are who you say you are. Please understand that someone might have copied User Content you have already posted and we will not be able to remove such copies. We might also choose simply to render that User Content invisible to other users and the public (rather than deleting it). We might also have to archive it for legal purposes as we explain in this Privacy Policy below. </li></ul><h3 class="css-rv324f-Heading em4arlq0">2. Consent</h3><p class="css-1oblyum-P e1ccqnho0">When you visit any Site or use any Services you are consenting to the receipt and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy if you are not a user in or from the EEA.

Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3><p class="css-1oblyum-P e1ccqnho0">We may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will provide a prominent notice. Your use after you have seen the notice will be consent of the changes, unless you are a user in the EEA, in which case you will click on the link to consent to it that will be provided to you.</p><p class="css-1oblyum-P e1ccqnho0">Changes will not have a retroactive effect. In other words, information we receive is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is received. Thus, information received <em class="css-u6hpqs-Italic">after</em> the changes take effect will be subject to that new version of the Privacy Policy. </p><h3 class="css-rv324f-Heading em4arlq0">4. Information We Receive and How We Receive It</h3><p class="css-1oblyum-P e1ccqnho0">We receive information about you—which is defined below as “Personal Information”—and your use of our Services—which is “Technical Information”—that comes from systems that measure use of our Services and also from Cookies on your browser (explained below). This Section 4 explains the information received and how it is received. The next section, Section 5, explains our use. Section 8 explains how you can protect your Personal Information and control what we receive and use.</p><ul class="css-1j03y5a-Ul e12bsgp30"><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">4.1 Personal Information</strong></li><ul class="css-1j03y5a-Ul e12bsgp30"><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">A. Definition:</strong> Applicable laws define personal information in numerous ways. Some of those definitions extend to information well beyond what we receive. We do not receive (or use) all that much. However, we have adopted the definition of “Personal Data” set forth in the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (“GDPR”) and called it “Personal Information.” Personal Information means: any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</li><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">B. Some Examples</strong></li><style data-emotion-css="3ng6mv-Ol">.css-3ng6mv-Ol{margin:32px 0 0 0;padding:0;}</style><ol class="css-3ng6mv-Ol e12bsgp31"><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">Just Visiting?</strong> Then we do not receive “Personal Information” but only “Technical Information,” which we have defined below (typically from Cookies). In some jurisdictions the Technical Information could fall within the above definition of Personal Information, so we are careful with its use, too. </li><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">Creating an Account? </strong>If you create an account or log into an existing account or use other features (described in more detail below), then we would receive the following: your name and username; your password; your email address; and limited information from Stripe through “Stripe Connect,” which is used to enable login. If you log in through a social network, then that network might provide us with some Personal Information.</li><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">Posting User Content? </strong>If you post User Content and it includes information about you (such as your physical features or political or religious positions) we receive that information because we have to post the User Content and archive it but we do not use it. </li></ol><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">C. How We Receive Personal Information: </strong>Generally speaking, you provide us with Personal Information by: (1) logging into, or creating, an account; (2) providing feedback to us; (3) posting a review or making other comments on any public forums available on the Sites; (4) entering a contest or sweepstakes or filling out a survey; or (5) submitting other user-generated or submitted content (#2 through 5 are defined as “User Content”). We also may receive Personal Information from Site usage to help us improve Site performance, content selection, product design, and usability.</li><ol class="css-3ng6mv-Ol e12bsgp31"><ol class="css-3ng6mv-Ol e12bsgp31"><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">Using Social Media for Access: </strong>You can create an account or log in using social media such as Facebook or Twitter.

Alternatively, we offer the option to create an account without any connection to any social media platform – with your email and a personal password.</p></li><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><p class="css-1oblyum-P e1ccqnho0"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">Providing Us with Personal Information through User Content: </strong>You might end up providing us with Personal Information when you submit User Content, including your use of any public forums we may offer such as newsfeeds, blogs, message boards or similar tools, and articles, videos, posts or comments you make. If you include in your posts, etc., your location, ethnicity, gender and other such information then you are making such Personal Information available to any visitors to any or our Sites.

How We Use Information We Receive </h3><p class="css-1oblyum-P e1ccqnho0">We use information primarily to provide a good user experience, which includes enabling you to use the Services, communicating with you and, as a result, improving the performance of our Services. When we write “use the information” we mean, for example, knowing who you are when you login, which simplifies the login process and points you to content and Services that are consistent with your preferences. We need to communicate with you about your account (if you have one), User Content and our Services. And, improving the Services means that we need to learn how fast pages load, where people view content, where they go and so forth. (All of that comes from Technical Information. We are not personally tracking you.)</p><ul class="css-1j03y5a-Ul e12bsgp30"><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">5.1 How We Use Personal Information</strong></li><ul class="css-1j03y5a-Ul e12bsgp30"><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">A. In General: </strong>We primarily use the Personal Information we receive: (1) to provide our Services; (2) to allow us to properly maintain our Site and our services and to make improvements or upgrades as we deem appropriate; (3) to send you newsletters about topics that we believe are of interest to you; (4) to inform you of products or services from us or others that may be of interest to you; (5) to respond to your inquiries; (6) to enable selected third parties to perform certain services (such as maintain our databases or provide us with emailing capabilities when we send our occasional newsletter or for you to establish an account for us to pay); (7) to prevent fraud, including the unauthorized use of this Site or our services or violations of applicable policies and the Terms of Service; and (8) to ensure compliance with the law. We may also use Personal Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our agreements with you, including the Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy.</li><ul class="css-1j03y5a-Ul e12bsgp30"><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold"><em class="css-u6hpqs-Italic">Example: </em></strong><em class="css-u6hpqs-Italic">For example, you create an account and start uploading User Content e.g., an article, a review, a comment. In some situations we have agreed with you (through the </em><a href="https://vocal.media/terms-of-use" class="css-1psntrz">Terms of Use</a><em class="css-u6hpqs-Italic">) to pay you. In that case, we obviously need to use your Personal Information. Or, perhaps we need to communicate with you about the User Content you have uploaded.</em></li></ul><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">B. What We Do Not Do: </strong>We’re proud of the limits we have adopted to our use of your Personal Information because it strengthens our commitment to our users as members of a community. So here is a brief list:</li></ul><ol class="css-3ng6mv-Ol e12bsgp31"><ol class="css-3ng6mv-Ol e12bsgp31"><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32">We don’t license, sell or give away your Personal Information—e.g., to someone who will market to you.</li><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32">We don’t profile you.</li><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32">We don’t keep your Personal Information beyond the time-frame we need for our Services and our obligations under contract with you.</li></ol></ol><ul class="css-1j03y5a-Ul e12bsgp30"><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">C.

In particular, we do not provide it to third parties for them to market to you.</li></ul><ol class="css-3ng6mv-Ol e12bsgp31"><ol class="css-3ng6mv-Ol e12bsgp31"><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">Processing for Your Account, etc.: </strong>The main sharing of your Personal Information comes when you want to establish an account, so we have to transmit your Personal Information to a third party that manages those accounts, which is currently Stripe. You are redirected to Stripe, where you establish your account, which is called the “Stripe Connect” service that generates the Stripe Access Token, Refresh Token, Publishable token, Account Type and user ID.</li><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">Re-publication of User Content: </strong>From time to time, we receive requests from other media companies to license some User Content they have seen on one or more of our Sites. <em class="css-u6hpqs-Italic">We never provide it to them without first obtaining the express consent of the user that created that User Content.</em> If that user does not consent, then we do not share the relevant Personal Information with that media company.</li><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">When You Use Social Media for Access: </strong>When you log-in to a Site through social media platform (e.g., with Log In With Facebook) Personal Information can be exchanged based on the Sites you visit or other Services you use. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with those services’ privacy policies and privacy controls. In addition, when you visit the Site while logged into one of those services, that service might be able to identify you and associate the Technical Information with other information the service already has about you.</li><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">Government Requests and Other Actions: </strong>We may also share Personal Information in the following circumstances: (a) upon receipt of a governmental request for information; (b) in response to a subpoena or a court order; (c) to comply with relevant laws; (d) in response to an investigation of fraud regarding a specific individual, and to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (e) in an effort to safeguard the person or property of a Company employee or a third party; (f) when we believe it is necessary to protect our interests, or we believe in good faith that the law requires the sharing of your Personal Information; or (g) to enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</li><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">Future Business Structure: </strong>We may, in the future, decide to sell, merge, or otherwise reorganize our business or assets. We reserve the right to transfer and disclose Personal Information in these circumstances to an entity acquiring the company or relevant assets. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy or in a different policy that they elect to adopt).</li><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">Aggregated Information: </strong>Finally, we may also share de-identified aggregate information with third parties and advertisers so they can measure the effectiveness of any advertisements viewed in connection with our Sites and understand their audiences. For example, we may tell advertisers the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement. We might also use such aggregated information to modify our Services for better performance or other reasons.</li></ol></ol><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">5.2 How We Use Technical Information: </strong>The Technical Information we receive (e.g., from Cookies) is used to enable your use of the Services such as storing your login information to accelerate that process or to respond to your preferences. We also use Technical Information to customize our infrequent newsletters, as well as advertising and Site content based on browser type and user profile information. The Technical Information may also provide measurements of overall and specific activity on our Sites in the use of other Services, allowing us to modify the look-and-feel, content and performance of our Services.</li></ul><h3 class="css-rv324f-Heading em4arlq0">Third Party Services and Advertising</h3><ul class="css-1j03y5a-Ul e12bsgp30"><li class="css-x3ber7-Li e12bsgp32"><strong class="css-nuxzf3-Bold">A.

Third Party Advertising: </strong>We do not have a lot of advertising on our Sites. But, some of the advertising is delivered by third-party Internet advertising companies (also called “ad networks” or “network advertisers”). The rest of the ads are our own.<p class="css-1oblyum-P e1ccqnho0">Ad networks may use Cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Site or third-party websites, to deliver advertisements to you, measure their effectiveness, and personalize advertising content. The information practices of these advertising companies are governed by their own privacy policies and are not covered by this Privacy Policy.</p><p class="css-1oblyum-P e1ccqnho0">Some of these advertising companies may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), a cooperative of online marketing companies that offers a centralized tool for opting out of behavioral advertising delivered by each of its member companies. If you would like to obtain more information about the NAI and make choices about their members’ use of your information, please visit their website at networkadvertising.org.</p><p class="css-1oblyum-P e1ccqnho0">Also, through the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across different websites. To make choices about interest-based ads from participating third parties, please visit the DAA consumer opt out page. See <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/" class="css-1psntrz">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 class="css-rv324f-Heading em4arlq0">7. How Long Do We Keep the Personal Information?</h3><p class="css-1oblyum-P e1ccqnho0">Mindful of the principle of “privacy by default” we try to keep Personal Information only for as long as we need it for the purposes we have described here. What does that mean? For example, we will keep your account information for as long as your account remains open and then after that for as long as necessary to fulfill obligations and receive the benefits of any agreement we have with you, i.e., the Terms of Use. </p><p class="css-1oblyum-P e1ccqnho0">If you are posting User Content under that agreement, please note that we might continue to post it after your account is deactivated. Any association between your account and information we store will no longer be accessible through your account. However, any public activity on your account prior to deletion will remain stored on our servers and might remain accessible to the public. In addition, we will keep archived copies of your Personal Information for the legal purposes we described above (e.g., to respond to government requests, and if we are involved in legal disputes that involve you or your Personal Information).</p><h3 class="css-rv324f-Heading em4arlq0">8.
