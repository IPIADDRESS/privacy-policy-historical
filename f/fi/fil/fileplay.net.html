Such information will enable us to understand, in general terms, user preferences in relation to the content of the website and the effectiveness of advertising ( for example, advertisers may find it useful if you can inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day)</li>
</ol>
<br>
