                        <br>
                      SpeedBit provides a variety of products and services.  Some of our products are Free, supported by unobtrusive advertisements within SpeedBit's web sites and program windows (for example, Download Accelerator Plus (DAP), Free version, and the Fileratings.com site).  We also offer paid products and services (for example - Download Accelerator Plus Premium version and the DAPDrive storage service). Learn more about SpeedBit products and services: <a href="http://www.speedbit.com/About.asp">http://www.speedbit.com/About.asp</a>.</p>
                    <p>We have designed DAP according to the standard "ad-supported" business model. Users can choose to receive DAP free of charge, and be exposed to standard conventional advertising (e.g. banners within the application window, just like AIM(tm), Opera browser(tm), MSN Messenger(tm) and most websites).  Or users can buy a paid version, with additional features and no advertising. Either way, our users can enjoy a product, service and technology that took a lot of hard work and money to create.</p>
                    <p>We're wary of other kinds of advertising-supported software, like 'adware' found elsewhere, but we'll never track what sites you visit, nor we will bombard you with adware-type pop-up ads.</p>
                    <p>No matter which products or services you choose, free and/or paid, your privacy is important to us. We have chosen to undertake strict safeguards to protect user privacy, and we strive to make sure those practices meet and exceed industry standards. We welcome any comments and suggestions for improvement: <a href="mailto:privacy@speedbit.com">privacy@speedbit.com</a>.</p>
                    <p>This privacy policy governs your use of SpeedBit various Products and Services, free and/or paid, including Download Accelerator Plus (DAP) and all other software, features, tools, Add-Ons, websites, and services offered by SpeedBit.</p>
                    <p>This privacy policy explains the practices that apply to the information that you provide or that may be generated by your use of SpeedBit Products and Services.</p>
                    <p>Please note that products and services by third parties that you may choose to use are subject to their own privacy policies. We recommend that you consult their respective privacy policies.</p>
                    <p><a name="Collection"></a><b>Submission and Collection of information</b><br>
                          <br>
                      When you register and/or use SpeedBit's Products, Services and/or web sites, you may choose, voluntarily, to provide Personally Identifiable Information about yourself. Your Personally Identifiable Information may include registration-related information (such as name, addresses, e-mail addresses, birth date or gender) submitted during the registration, update and un-installation of the Products and/or Services, along with the details of the Products and/or Services; and transaction-related information (such as credit card or other preferred means of payment, a history of Products and Services purchased through SpeedBit, your billing and shipping information, or customer service information about you as a SpeedBit user or subscriber) hereunder Transaction-Related Information.
Personally Identifiable Information may be submitted by you voluntarily, either through forms which you have to fill in (such as the Registration form presented to you during the product installation), or through forms that are automatically filled-in by the products or services, which you can further correct, modify or delete before you choose to submit.  Personally Identifiable Information does not include information that is collected anonymously (i.e., without identification of the individual user) or demographic information not connected to an identified individual.</p>
                    <p> In addition, Non-Personally Identifiable Information may be provided by you or may be generated by your mere use of SpeedBit Products and Service.  Non-Personally Identifiable Information may include the use of a particular feature or offering on SpeedBit Products and/or Services, the files that were downloaded or the source server from which files were downloaded, visits to SpeedBit Web sites and pages, and responses to the offerings and advertisements presented on SpeedBit Products and/or Services and/or web sites and pages and/or email communication.</p>
                    <p>
Your Non-Personally Identifiable Information may also include standard internet communications automatically sent by your computer.  This information may include: the type of browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox), the type of operating system (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS); Internet protocol addresses (including any host name or geographic information associated with these addresses); and information related to your computer system configuration. 
We are especially careful about the privacy of your Usernames and Passwords.  We consider this information highly sensitive, and we treat it with the appropriate care.  If your requests to SpeedBit servers or your file downloads include Usernames and Passwords, we will always consider this information as Personally Identifiable Information.  This information will be subject to the strict practices and protections which we offer to users’ Personally Identifiable Information.</p><p>
Furthermore, if SpeedBit ever combines your Personally Identifiable Information with your non-Personally Identifiable Information, the entire combined information will be considered Personally Identifiable Information.  This combined information will therefore be subject to the strict protections SpeedBit offers for its users’ Personally Identifiable Information.</p><p>In some cases, if you decide not to provide certain information or if you delete certain automatically filled-in information from certain SpeedBit forms (e.g. email address), you may not be able to complete the applicable process.  For example, registering for a service or installing a product may sometimes require that you provide certain information.

                    <p><a name="InfoUsed" id="InfoUsed"></a><b>How is the information
                      being used?</b> </p>
                    <p>The information is used to operate and improve the features, offerings and content presented to you by SpeedBit; to streamline the use of SpeedBit Products and Services on your computer, to personalize the content and advertisements provided to you; to fulfill your requests for products, programs, and services; to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries; to conduct research about your use of the Products, Services and/or web sites, offerings and advertisements presented on SpeedBit Products, Services, email communication, web sites and pages; and to help offer you other products, programs, or services that may be of interest.</p><p>
While using the product, users may receive in-context services, advertisement and offers (in the form of banners or textual references such as Google's AdSense(tm) ads on a web site) (hereafter: In Context References), to be presented within the product interface.  These In Context References are selected based on non-personally identifiable information such as: which files were downloaded, the source server from which files were downloaded,  a user’s geographical location, and a user’s operating system or browser type. Such In Context References, if presented, will always be offered and selected anonymously - without personally identifying specific users.</p><p>
Your Personally Identifiable Information will not be shared with third parties unless you have consented to the sharing of this information. SpeedBit may use your information to present offers to you on behalf of business partners and advertisers. These business partners and advertisers may receive aggregate data about various groups of SpeedBit users, but they do not receive information that personally identifies you.</p><p>
Your information may be accessed and disclosed if required by legal procedures.</p><p>
Special notice regarding In Context References: SpeedBit does not gather or track any personal information of the users who view or response to In Context References, and SpeedBit does not provide such information to advertisers when you interact with or view In Context References. However, by interacting with, viewing or clicking an In Context Reference, you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you, as an anonymous user, meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. For example, if an advertiser targets its ad at the keyword "ICQ", the advertiser may reasonably deduce that a user downloaded a file named 'icq.exe' (or similar) and/or downloaded a file from the site www.icq.com.</p><p>
Special notice regarding Transaction-Related Information - Transaction-Related Information submitted during the purchase or the trial order of Paid Products or Paid Services is collected either by SpeedBit or by its payment processing partners. Except as necessary for the purpose of routine processing of payments, SpeedBit does not share credit history or Transaction-Related Information with other companies or third parties, unless compelled by law or court order to do so.
