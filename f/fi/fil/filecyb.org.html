<h2>FileCyb.org Privacy Policy</h2>

	<h3>Introduction</h3>	
	
<p>Welcome to FileCyb.org. We want you to know that we respect your privacy and
that we value your business. This privacy statement covers the Raptor
software, FileCyb.org software and the FileCyb.org website
(www.filecyb.org). In order to ensure your privacy we want you to know the
details of what information we collect and what we do with it.
</p>

<h3 class="inpanel">INFORMATION COLLECTION</h3>	

<p>FileCyb.org takes your privacy very seriously. In order to provide you with
the highest quality service, we do collect certain information from you in
accordance with the following guidelines.
</p>

<h4>Direct Submissions:</h4>	

<p>In order to provide you with excellent service and a superior customer
experience FileCyb.org has several areas where you can submit information to
us and we also have features that automatically collect information from
users of our service. Some of the information you may choose to provide
includes personally identifiable information such as your name, address,
email, age, gender and interests. In addition, we may collect information
linked to your communications preferences, and your payment and billing
information.

</p>

<h4>Cookies and Other Technology:</h4>	

<p>FileCyb.org may use cookies or other technologies for several purposes all
designed to improve the customer experience. Within the FileCyb.org service
we may use either what are commonly called temporary or "session" cookies as
well as permanent or "persistent" cookies. Temporary or "session" cookies
mean that they only last as long as you are online. We may use these cookies
to identify you as a valid member so that we can deliver files to you, and
to help us personalize your service experience based on your registration
preferences (such as genre choice, your connection speed, etc). We may also
use session cookies to help us facilitate any promotions or surveys that we
may provide. These cookies do not contain any personally identifying
information and we do not store data collected by them.</p>

<p>We may sometimes use cookies, as well as other tracking technology, such as
  web beacons, within the promotional emails that we send to our members or
  advertisements for our service or sites. These technologies help us track,
  for example, whether an e-mail recipient has completed an event, such as
  signing up for a trial. The generated information is related to
  non-personally identifiable customer identification numbers and is only
  analyzed at aggregate levels. We may send these emails via third-party
  service providers that act on our behalf.</p>
  
  <p>We sometimes utilize third party service providers to help us track the
  activity and user flows within our service or sites. These third parties may
  use temporary cookies and/or web beaconing technology to facilitate such
  tracking. Such tracking would track an individual user's movements but the
  data would not be tracked in a personally identifiable way. Such data would
  be stored and analyzed on an aggregated basis for purposes of internal
  analysis by FileCyb.org to continue to optimize our customer experience.</p>
  
  <p>If we engage with any advertising partners and or other third parties, our
  approved advertising partners and third parties whose products or services
  are promoted on our site may also use cookies, and we advise you to check
  their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other privacy
  practices if you are presented with one of their offers during your
  association with FileCyb.org.</p>

<h4>Cookies and Other Technology:</h4>	

<p>FileCyb.org may use cookies or other technologies for several purposes all
designed to improve the customer experience. Within the FileCyb.org service
we may use either what are commonly called temporary or "session" cookies as
well as permanent or "persistent" cookies. Temporary or "session" cookies
mean that they only last as long as you are online. We may use these cookies
to identify you as a valid member so that we can deliver files to you, and
to help us personalize your service experience based on your registration
preferences (such as genre choice, your connection speed, etc). We may also
use session cookies to help us facilitate any promotions or surveys that we
may provide. These cookies do not contain any personally identifying
information and we do not store data collected by them.</p>
  
  <h4>Log Files and ip addresses:</h4>

<p>We use internet protocol (ip) addresses, browser type, internet service
provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and
number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users'
movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for
aggregate use. ip addresses are not linked by FileCyb.org to personally
identifiable information and are not kept after the statistics are logged in
the aggregated database. The information we collect is used for internal
review and is then discarded. It is not shared with other organizations.
However, users should be aware that both static and dynamic ip addresses can
be mapped back to users on most ISPs based on the users login time and
recorded information.</p>

<h3 class="inpanel">LINKS</h3>

<p>In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, we may choose
various third party web sites to link from or frame within the FileCyb.org
website. We may also participate in co-branding, advertising and other
relationships to offer e-commerce and other services and features to our
users. Information about you may be visible to subsequent websites if you
link off of the FileCyb.org website. However, even if the third party is
affiliated with us, we have no control over these linked sites, each of
which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us.
Data collected by our co-brand partners, advertisers or third party web
sites (even if offered on or through our site) is not received by us. As
such, we are not responsible for, or have any control over, the content or
the privacy policies of those third party websites, and encourage all users
to read theprivacy policies of each and every website visited when linking from
FileCyb.org.com. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you
therefore access them at your own risk. This privacy statement applies
solely to information collected by FileCyb.org.</p>

<h3 class="inpanel">CHOICE/OPT-OUT</h3>

<p>As a member of FileCyb.org, you can download, search, share and publish just
about any digital file. Users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of the
sharing component of the FileCyb.org Software, so that such user's files are
not made available to other users, by disabling that component of the
Software. Each user is provided with the option to disable the sharing
component of the Software by going into the preferences section of our site
and "disabling" the appropriate component...</p>

<p>Additionally you can modify your registration and preferences information at
any time in the My Account section of our service. Also all of FileCyb.org's
promotional emails are accompanied with information on how to change your
communications preferences and how to "opt-out" of certain communications.
For access to our communications preferences page please go to the My
Account section of the Service.</p>

<h3 class="inpanel">OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h3>

<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. We operate
our website in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
(COPPA). We never knowingly collect or maintain information at or on our
website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website
is directed at or structured to attract anyone under 13. Visitors younger
than 13 years of age may NOT use the FileCyb.org website and software and
must LEAVE immediately.</p>

<h3 class="inpanel">LEGAL DISCLAIMER</h3>

<p>At times FileCyb.org may be required by law or litigation to disclose your
personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we
determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of
public importance that disclosure of information is necessary.</p>

<h3 class="inpanel">SECURITY</h3>

<p>We take every reasonable precaution to protect information from misuse, loss
and unauthorized access. Although we cannot guarantee that users'
information will not be subject to unauthorized access, we have put in place
physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
information we may collect online. All employees are kept up to date on our
security and privacy practices.</p>

<h3 class="inpanel">NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES</h3>

<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to
this privacy statement and on our homepage so our users are always aware of
what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any,
we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable
information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was
collected, we will notify registered users by way of an e-mail or instant
messaging or similar method, and/or by posting a notice on our website.</p>
