<b>Privacy Policy</b><br>
Updated November 24, 2009 <br>
<br>
Thank you for visiting this website (the "Website"). Your patronage 
means a lot to us.   At American Movie Classics Company LLC   
("Company"), we understand that privacy is an important issue for 
visitors to our websites and we are committed to providing you clear 
information about how we treat information provided to us.  This Privacy
 Policy ("Policy") describes the information we collect, what we do with
 it and the safeguards we have in place to protect it.  <br>
<br>
Your use of any part of the Website indicates your acceptance of this 
Policy and of the collection, use and disclosure of your personal 
information in accordance with this Policy.  Please note that this 
Policy applies only to personal information collected on the Website. It
 does not apply to any other information collected or obtained by any 
other means by Company, its parents, affiliates, or subsidiaries.<br>
<br>
As we update and expand our services, we reserve the right to modify 
this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted here so that
 you are always aware of what information is collected, how it is used 
and when, if ever, it is disclosed.  Please check this page periodically
 for changes.  Your continued use of this site after changes to the 
Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the terms of any revisions 
to this Policy.<br>
<br>
INFORMATION COLLECTION<br>
<br>
When you register for an account or visit certain portions of the 
Website, you may be prompted to provide, on a voluntary basis, certain 
information about yourself such as: (i) name; (ii) email address; (iii) 
date of birth; (iv) mailing address; (v) telephone numbers; and (vi) 
interests and hobbies.  You are not required to provide any information 
to use our Website, although certain areas may require registration.<br>
<br>
Certain third parties may join with us to offer website activities, 
features or promotions, such as contests or special events.  By 
submitting personal information in conjunction with these joint 
activities, you are providing that information to both parties 
simultaneously.  The co-sponsor or partner may maintain a separate 
privacy policy governing the collection, use, and disclosure of your 
personal information, and this Policy does not cover their collection, 
use, and/or disclosure.  For example, during your visit to our Website, 
you may link to or view as part of a frame on a page of this Website, 
certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party.  
Also, through this Website you may be introduced to, or be able to 
access, information, websites, advertisements, features, contests or 
sweepstakes offered by other parties. Company is not responsible for the
 actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the 
applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing 
information on a feature page or page operated by a third party.   <br>
<br>
The Website may link to certain third parties who offer services on our 
behalf.  Information collected on those sites is subject to the third 
party's own privacy policy.  However, in some circumstances, those third
 parties may provide us with the information you provide to the third 
party. If so, we will treat that information in accordance with this 
Policy.<br>
<br>
We may also use cookies and other technologies to learn about how you 
interact with our site to provide you with better service, to improve 
your customer experience, and for internal research and reporting 
purposes. We also may collect anonymous data on Website activity, such 
as how many people visit the site, what pages they visit, where they 
come from, how long they stay, what items they purchase, etc.   Such 
data is collected on an aggregate, anonymous basis, through the use of 
Internet server logs and cookies.  We may also take non-anonymous data 
and de-identify it so that it becomes anonymous either by itself or when
 aggregated.  We may use any anonymous or aggregated data for any 
purpose, including for research and marketing purposes, and may also 
share such data with any third parties, such as advertisers.<br>
<br>
INFORMATION USE<br>
<br>
By providing information on the Website, you agree that personal 
information that you provide may be used by Company, its parents, 
affiliates, and subsidiaries to communicate with you for the purposes 
of: offering discounts, promoting services and products, informing you 
about new services and products, providing news on upcoming sporting and
 entertainment events, providing programming schedules, conducting 
surveys, marketing special gift or discount offerings, offering ticket 
discounts, conducting contests and sweepstakes, and similar purposes.

<br>
From time to time, we may provide access to information to select third 
parties to assist us in providing services or for other legitimate 
business purposes. For example, we may provide access to companies 
providing services to us, including billing, sales and marketing, market
 research, fulfillment, data storage, analysis and processing, and legal
 services.  We may also provide access to third parties who assist us in
 providing targeted advertising. Third parties who have such access may 
not use the information for any other purpose, including their own 
marketing.<br>
<br>
INFORMATION DISCLOSURE<br>
<br>
We will disclose personally identifiable information to non-affiliated 
third parties (a) as set forth in this Policy; (b) where it is necessary
 for us to render our services or conduct a legitimate business activity
 related to our services; or (c) with appropriate consent.  We may 
disclose personally identifiable information to affiliated third 
parties, including parents, affiliates, subsidiaries and joint venture 
partners at any time, subject to the use restrictions set forth in this 
Policy.<br>
You acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve and 
disclose your account information and content if required to do so by 
law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or 
disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; 
(b) enforce our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, or other contracts 
with you; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of 
third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e)
 protect our rights, property or personal safety as well as those of our
 users and the public. We may also disclose information to law 
enforcement agencies in emergency circumstances, where the disclosure of
 such information is consistent with the types of emergency disclosures 
permitted or required by law.<br>
<br>
Finally, we also reserve the right to disclose and transfer all of the 
information collected at our sites, including personally identifiable 
information, to a successor company in connection with a merger, 
acquisition or sale of all, or components, of our business.<br>
