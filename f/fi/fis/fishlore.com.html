<br>
<b>How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?</b><br> We only use Personally Identifiable Information to email Visitors and Authorized Customers about the subject matter of the Site.

<b>Are Cookies Used on the Site?</b><br> Cookies are used when visitors access the FishLore forum. We use Cookies to obtain information about the preferences of our Authorized Customers and the services they select. We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect our Authorized Customers.

An individual who requests to have Personally Identifiable Information deactivated will have this information functionally deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally Identifiable Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward.
<br>
<br><b>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?</b><br> We will let our Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes to our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site.
