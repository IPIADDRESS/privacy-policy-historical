All such information is acquired from either the wireless carrier's or operator's website or from the user's mobile device via the wireless carrier's or operator's network. This data is usually limited to the user's cell phone number. In some cases, such as for prize fulfilment for a mobile contest, the user's mailing address is also provided. The user must explicitly "opt in" through the wireless carrier or operator in order for any of this information to be collected and its use is governed by this Privacy Policy and any policies or procedures of the user's wireless carrier or operator. In some cases, We may receive authentication information directly from mobile users, including in the form of a personal information number (PIN) previously sent to a mobile user.</div>

<div id="privacyTitle">SERVICE-RELATED ANNOUNCEMENT</div>
<div id="privacyText">We will send you service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if Our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, We might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</div>
<div id="privacyTitle">CUSTOMER SERVICE</div>
<div id="privacyText">We will also communicate with you in response to your customer service enquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.</div>
<div id="privacyTitle">Disclosures and Sharing of Information</div>
<div id="privacyText">As a matter of policy, We do not sell or rent any of your information to third parties for any advertising or marketing purposes. However, the following describes some of the ways that We may disclose your information in the normal course of providing Our services.</div>
<div id="privacyTitle">LEGAL REQUESTS &amp; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS</div>
<div id="privacyText">We reserve the right to disclose information as required by law or regulation and when We believe that disclosure is necessary to protect Our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. Notwithstanding any provisions herein, We may disclose Personal Data to governmental authorities when required or reasonably requested to do so by such governmental authorities. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the extent that it is in conflict with any law that may be applicable to the Personal Data of a Data Subject.</div>
<div id="privacyTitle"> PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE EU AND SWITZERLAND</div>
<div id="privacyText">CLX&nbsp;processes Personal Data on behalf of its clients ("Customers"), that has been collected by or on behalf of those Customers including Personal Data received from the European Union. "Personal Data" or "Personal Data" means information relating to an identified or identifiable person. With the objective to validate transfers of Personal Data under European data protection laws to countries outside EU and Switzerland we are making available the European Commission's controller-to-processor standard contractual clauses, commonly referred to as "model clauses" (in the form adopted by decision 2010/87/EU of 5 February 2010 and with Appendices 1 &amp; 2. Any Customer of Mblox Inc., &nbsp;CLX Networks AB Telekomünikasyon Hiz. LTD. ŞTİ or Mblox Limited who undertakes processing activities on the CLX&nbsp;platform (in respect of Personal Data which is governed by the European data protection laws), should contact privacy@clxcommunications.com for more details.</div>
<div id="privacyTitle">DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO CLX&nbsp;AFFILIATES</div>
<div id="privacyText">Because CLX is a global C&nbsp;company, We may share your information with other CLX&nbsp;affiliates and business units in other parts of the world in order to provide you with Our services. Your Personal Data may be transferred by Us from your home country to CLX employees in CLX&nbsp;offices around the world, who may communicate with you regarding your enquiry. Please understand that We limit access to your Personal Data to only those CLX&nbsp;employees who We believe need access in order to provide services to you or to otherwise perform their duties.</div>
<div id="privacyTitle">Data Processor</div>
<div id="privacyText">As Data Processor, CLX&nbsp;will only process Personal Data pursuant to the instructions of the applicable Customer (for example where We act as a Data Processor in relation to the processing activities of Customers on Our platform). CLX may use the services of third party Data Processors to process Personal Data in accordance with purposes identified for such Personal Data by the applicable Customer (including but not limited to the provision of services). CLX&nbsp;will not be responsible for determining the authenticity of any purported Data Subject's request to access his or her Personal Data. In the absence of express instructions to do so from the applicable Customer, CLX&nbsp;will not provide a purported Data Subject with access to his or her Personal Data unless it is demonstrated to CLX's satisfaction that the applicable Data Controller has refused such access.</div>
<div id="privacyTitle">Data Controller</div>
<div id="privacyText">As Data Controller, CLX receives Personal Data about Our business contacts. CLX owns and controls such Personal Data as stated in this Privacy Policy. In parallel and in accordance with Recital 47 of the European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, We shall act as an independent Data Controller with respect to the processing of Personal Data which is necessary for the operation of Our service which shall include any information processed for the purpose of the conveyance of a communication on an electronic communications network or for the billing thereof.</div>
<div id="privacyTitle">HIPAA</div>
<div id="privacyText">From time to time, CLX&nbsp;provides messaging services to health care providers, and serves as a "Business Associate" (as that term is defined pursuant to HIPAA Regulations) to such providers in relation to the handling of protected health information ("PHI") that is made a part of Our services.</div>
<div id="privacyTitle">De-identification</div>
<div id="privacyText">CLX&nbsp;may de-identify or depersonalize data into anonymized and aggregate data that it derives from Customers ("Anonymous Data"). Anonymous Data means data that includes no Personal Data or unique identifiers that could later be used to refer to the Personal Data to which the data was once associated. CLX&nbsp;uses only Anonymous Data in performing analyses, and may disclose Anonymous Data to its Customers who have requested such analyses and to third parties where We are contractually entitled to do so.</div>
<div id="privacyTitle">This Site is Not for Use by Children</div>
<div id="privacyText">Protecting the privacy of children is important to CLX. For that reason, the Site is structured specifically to not attract anyone under 13, nor do We collect or maintain Personal Data on the Site from those who CLX&nbsp;actually knows are under 13. If CLX learns or is notified that it has collected information from users under the age of 13, CLX&nbsp;will immediately delete such Personal Data.</div>
<div id="privacyTitle">Opt-Out</div>
<div id="privacyText">We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your Personal Data used for certain purposes, when We ask for this information. For example, if you register with Us but no longer wish to receive Our newsletters and/or related communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing Us at&nbsp;legal@clxcommunications.com.</div>
<div id="privacyTitle">Security</div>
<div id="privacyText">We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to guard against unauthorized or unlawful processing of your Personal Data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your Personal Data. CLX uses industry-standard security measures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of any Personal Data it owns or processes on behalf of Customers, including, in appropriate circumstances, the use of firewalls, restricted access, and encrypted transmissions. CLX&nbsp;limits access to Personal Data to those persons in CLX's organization who have a business need to process such Personal Data. However, no company, including CLX, can fully eliminate the security risks associated with such Personal Data. Due to factors beyond CLX's control, CLX&nbsp;cannot ensure that Personal Data will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, CLX&nbsp;may become legally obligated to disclose such data, or, despite precautions, third parties may circumvent security measures to intercept or access such data.</div>
<div id="privacyTitle">Disclaimer</div>
<div id="privacyText">We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other Personal Data will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), We may be forced to disclose Personal Data to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your Personal Data that they collect from the Site. CLX&nbsp;does not review, comment upon, or monitor its Customers' compliance with their respective privacy policies, nor does CLX&nbsp;review Customer instructions to determine whether they are in compliance or conflict with the terms of a Customer's published privacy policy.</div>
<div id="privacyTitle">Third Parties</div>
<div id="privacyText">Please be advised this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that CLX&nbsp;does not own or control, or to people that CLX&nbsp;does not employ or manage. This includes links to other websites on the Site as well as any companies from whom you may have ordered services or products that are transmitted over CLX's network, and any companies from whom you may be purchasing telecommunications services. CLX&nbsp;recommends that you be aware when you leave the Site and read the terms of use and privacy policies of any site, product or service that collects Personal Data.</div>
<div id="privacyTitle">Changes to this Privacy Policy</div>
<div id="privacyText">We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it regularly. If We make changes to this Privacy Policy, We will post the revised Privacy Policy on the Site and other places We deem appropriate. All such changes shall be binding on you 30 days after they are initially posted on the Site unless you are a new user, in which case they are binding on you immediately.</div>
<div id="privacyTitle">Acquisitions</div>
<div id="privacyText">If another company acquires CLX&nbsp;or its assets, that company will (a) process that Personal Data held by CLX, and (b) assume the rights and obligations regarding such Personal Data described in this Privacy Policy.</div>
<div id="privacyTitle">Update Information / Revoke Choices / Suggestions / Contact Information</div>
<div id="privacyText">If you would like to update or correct any information that you have provided to CLX&nbsp;through your use of Our services or this website, limit or opt-out of certain communications, revoke prior communication choices you have made, or if you have suggestions for improving this privacy policy, please send an e-mail to&nbsp;legal@clxcommunications.com, or fill out the form in the Contact Us link on this website.
