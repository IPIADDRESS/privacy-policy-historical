                                <br><br><strong>4.1.1</strong> in the course of using this Web Site or registering with it and any services offered via this Web Site, certain information about you will be captured electronically or otherwise and transmitted to fish4 or and, potentially, to any third parties as set out above or to third parties who host our web servers or assist us in maintaining this Web Site; and

                                <br><br>For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998, you acknowledge that in the course of you advertising goods or services on our Web Site, certain personal data about your employees, agents or subcontractors or certain personal data of third parties appearing in the advertising you requested to appear on our Web Site may be captured electronically or otherwise by us.

                            <li><b>Our Responsibilities - How does fish4 protect user information?</b>
                                <br><br><strong>6.1</strong> When you enter into on-line credit or other payment card transactions (e.g. ordering advertising services on the Web Site), we offer the use of a secure server.  The secure server software encrypts the information that you input before it is transmitted to us.  To prevent unauthorised access, we follow legally required security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information that you have given to us.  This means that sometimes we may ask for proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.
                                <br><br><strong>6.2</strong> Areas of the Web Site where transactions are entered into, reviewed or transmitted may be password protected.  You can help to preserve your privacy by never sharing your password with anyone else.
                                <br><br><strong>6.3</strong> We seek to limit our employees' access to your information about you to those employees who need to have such information to service your account.  We emphasise to our employees the confidential nature of user information and the high level of importance that fish4 places on maintaining this confidentiality.
