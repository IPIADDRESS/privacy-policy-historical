				      <h3><a name="article1">Fishbowl's Privacy Statement</a></h3>
						
						<p>Fishbowl,  Inc. takes the privacy and security of our clients and their customers very  seriously. Fishbowl provides this Internet Privacy Statement because our  clients and their customers have a right to know what information we collect,  how it is used, and how it is protected.</p>
						
						<h3><a name="article2">Information Collection and Use</a></h3>
						
						<h4><i>Registration for Fishbowl Client Customers</i></h4>
						
						<p>In order receive emails sent by Fishbowl on  behalf of its clients; you must first complete a signup form (a) in a  participating store, (b) at an event, (c) by dropping your business card in a  fishbowl or basket or other collection device that states you are choosing to  join the client's email list, or (d) by registering online through its web  site. During registration, you are required to give contact information (such  as first and last name, month and day of birth, and email address). The client  provides this registration information to us. Fishbowl collects personally  identifiable information from our users during the initial signup process as  well as during surveys or preference requests. We use this information to  contact you with offers, newsletters and special promotions which you have  expressed interest in receiving.<br>
You may also be given the opportunity to  provide your cell phone number during the sign-up process or through a separate  email from a Fishbowl client. By providing your cell phone number, you are  agreeing to receive text (SMS) messages on your cell phone.<br>
You have the option to provide demographic  information (such as gender and zip code) to us; we encourage you to submit  this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience. If you  elect not to provide such demographic information, you may still participate in  the client's program offerings.<br>
Communications  may include offers, newsletters, updates, special promotions, surveys and  unsubscribe confirmations.<br>
In  compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, Fishbowl requires  all children under age thirteen (13) to obtain parental consent to join any of  our lists. All terms of our privacy policy apply to children under 13.</p>
						
						<p></p>
						
						<h4><i>Uses of Customer Information</i></h4>
						
						<p>Your email addresses is used only to send  email that was requested. Fishbowl follows an opt-in permission-based email and  text message (SMS) enrollment policy. Fishbowl will not send unsolicited, bulk  or commercial offers or advertisements. Fishbowl will NOT rent, sell, trade or  loan our clients' lists to anyone. All emails contain links on how to  unsubscribe from the client list. All SMS messages contain information on how  to unsubscribe from the client list. You may leave our client's lists at any  time for any reason. If you have any questions or feel that you received  unsolicited email or an unsolicited SMS message please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy_ques@fishbowl.com" title="Privacy Questions">privacy_ques@fishbowl.com</a>.<br>
Fishbowl  will use personally identifiable information to contact you when responding to  email support requests and other direct requests for information from Fishbowl.  To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify  your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>
						
						<p></p>
						
						<h4><i>Surveys or Contests</i></h4>
						
						<p>From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to  participate in web-based contests or surveys. If you participate, we will  request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in  these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a  choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information  typically includes contact information (such as name address and phone  number(s)), demographic information (such as zip code) and personal preference  information (such as your opinions). This information is used by our clients to  better understand their customers.<br>
Fishbowl  may use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests;  that company is prohibited from using your personally identifiable information  for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information  you provide through a contest or survey with any third party except with the  client unless we give you prior notice and you elect to permit the provision of  that information to the third party.</p>
						
						<p></p>
						
						<h4><i>Forward to a Friend</i></h4>
						
						<p>If you  choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about an email club to  which you subscribe, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.  This process will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him  or her to join the client email list. Fishbowl stores this information for the  sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our  referral program, after which the names collected are removed from the  database.</p>
						
						<h3><a name="article3">Information Sharing and Disclosure</a></h3>
						
						<p>Fishbowl only shares your data with the client from which  you have requested to receive offers. We do not provide the client with your  personally identifiable data; however, we do share reports about your  statistics and information about your preferences.

The other  organization will be bound by this policy</p>
						
						<p></p>
						
						<h4><i>Service Providers</i></h4>
						
						<p>We use third parties to provide data entry for our client  list member enrollment. When you sign up for an email club, we will share your  enrollment information with our data entry company so that the third party can  provide the service. Such third parties are prohibited from using your  personally identifiable information for any other purpose.<br>
Upon  request from a Fishbowl client, Fishbowl may use a third party vendor to  fulfill promotions on behalf of Fishbowl and the client. Any third party vendor  to Fishbowl is contractually prohibited from using your information for any  other purpose.</p>
						
						<p></p>
