  <p>With Fishbowl Inventory we got a quality piece of software, but more importantly, a team of "can do" people who are incredibly competent, positive, and client focused.  I really feel that they are invested in helping us to be as successful as possible using the tool that they have developed.<br><a href="/community/customer_comments.php#cust21"><em>BooJee Beads</em></a><br><a href="/community/customer_comments.php#cust21"><em>President</em></a></p><br><p>Fishbowl Inventory is very easy to use.  The tool was wisely developed to mirror all of the logical steps in business.
