    FISDAP Privacy Policy<br>
<br>
What This Privacy Policy Covers<br>
<br>
This policy covers how FISDAP treats personally identifiable information that FISDAP<br>
collects and receives. Personally identifiable information is information about you<br>
that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone<br>
number, student field and clinical experience data that can be tied to such students'<br>
name or other personal information, and that is not otherwise publicly available.<br>
This policy does not apply to the practices of organizations that FISDAP does<br>
not own or control, or to people that FISDAP does not employ or manage.<br>
<br>
Information Collection and Use<br>
<br>
FISDAP collects personally identifiable information when you create your account,<br>
when you use FISDAP products or services, or when you visit FISDAP pages. When you<br>
register we ask for information such as your name, address, email address, birth date,<br>
gender, zip code, phone number, and graduation date. Once you register with FISDAP and<br>
sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. FISDAP collects the data students<br>
enter about their experience during field and clinical internships, and during testing.<br>
FISDAP automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser,<br>
including your IP address and the page you request. FISDAP uses that information for the<br>
following general purposes: to provide information about the students' experience to the<br>
student, their instructors and the school staff, to improve our services, to contact you<br>
and to conduct research. FISDAP uses non-identifiable content from students field and<br>
clinical experience and testing results in its general business operations, such as<br>
research and providing anonymous reporting for other students, researcher and educators.<br>
<br>
FISDAP does not rent or sell any personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>
Students have the right to withhold their data from being used by us for our general<br>
business purposes, including for research. When any student account is created, the students<br>
are given a chance to decide if they want to grant consent for their data to be used in<br>
such a way or not.<br>
<br>
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, to establish or exercise our<br>
legal rights or defend against legal claims. We believe it is necessary to share<br>
information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal<br>
activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical<br>
safety of any person, violations of FISDAP's User Agreement, or as otherwise required<br>
by law. We will transfer information about you if FISDAP is acquired by or merged with<br>
another company to the acquiring company.<br>
<br>
Cookies<br>
<br>
FISDAP only uses session cookies that get deleted at the end of each session.<br>
<br>
Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences<br>
<br>
Students and their Instructors can edit their FISDAP Account Information at any<br>
time by going to the Admin section of the web site and clicking on the Account tab. At any<br>
time before their graduation dates, students can edit field and clinical data until they<br>
mark a given shift as complete. Instructors can view and edit their students' field and<br>
clinical data at any time.<br>
<br>
We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the FISDAP service,<br>
such as service announcements, administrative messages, late data entry reminders, and<br>
other messages that are considered part of your FISDAP account, without offering you<br>
the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.<br>
<br>
We limit access to personally identifiable information about you to employees, who we<br>
believe reasonably need that information to provide products or services to you or in order<br>
to do their jobs. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with<br>
federal regulations to protect personal information about you. Your FISDAP Account Information<br>
is password-protected. It is the user's responsibility to protect the security of their password.<br>
Passwords are stored in the database in an encrypted format, so we do not have access to your password.<br>
In certain areas FISDAP uses encryption to protect data transmissions. We do not control school or<br>
instructor access to the students' personal information. The school sets up access to the students'<br>
account as it deems appropriate.<br>
<br>
Changes to this Privacy Policy<br>
<br>
FISDAP may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we<br>
treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in<br>
your FISDAP account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.<br>
