<h1 id="toc0">Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your personal information for our services on the Fixr websites and is incorporated into our <a href="/info/terms_and_conditions.html">Terms and Conditions</a>.  The Fixr.com website (and any successor website) and the services offered in connection with such website will collectively be referred to as the "Site."  References to "we," "us," and "our" refer to FIXR, Inc.</p>


<h2 id="toc1">Collection</h2>
<p>We may collect and store the following personal information:</p>

<ul>
    <li>email address, physical contact information, and (depending on the service used) sometimes financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers, which you provide;</li>
    <li>transactional information based on your activities on the Site (such as bidding, buying, selling, and content you generate or that relates to your account);</li>
    <li>contact, billing and other information you provide;</li>
    <li>community discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through the Site and correspondence sent to us;</li>
    <li>other information from your interaction with the Site, content and advertising, including computer and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the sites, ad data, IP address and standard web log information;</li>
    <li>additional information we ask you to submit to authenticate yourself or if we believe you are violating site policies (for example, we may ask you to send us an ID or bill to verify your address, or to answer additional questions online to help verify your identity or ownership of an item you list); information from other companies, such as demographic and navigation data; and</li>
    <li>other supplemental information from third parties (for example, if you incur a debt to us, we will generally conduct a credit check by obtaining additional information about you from a credit bureau, as permitted by law).</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="toc2">Marketing</h2>
<p>We don't sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize our services, content and advertising. If you don't wish to receive marketing communications from us or participate in our ad-customization programs, simply indicate your preference in your account or by following the directions provided with the communication or advertisement.</p>


<h2 id="toc3">Use</h2>
<p>You agree that we may use your personal information to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>operate the Site and provide customer support;</li>
    <li>resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;</li>
    <li>prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our Terms and Conditions;</li>
    <li>customize, measure and improve our services, content and advertising;</li>
    <li>tell you about our services, targeted marketing, service updates, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences; and</li>
    <li>compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="toc4">Our Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
<p>We may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety.</p>

<p>We may also share your personal information with:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Our independent third-party contractors who help with our business operations (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs and co-branded credit cards).</li>
    <li>Other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service).</li>
    <li>Law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity. In such events, we will disclose information relevant to the investigation, such as name, city, state, zip code, telephone number, email address, Screen Name history, IP address, fraud complaints, and bidding and listing history.</li>
    <li>Other business entities, should we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="toc5">Information You Share on the Site</h2>
<p>Your Screen Name and zipcode location is displayed throughout the Site (and so available to the public), and is connected to all of your activity on the Site. Other people can see your job descriptions, bids, feedback, ratings and associated comments. Notices sent to other community members about suspicious activity and policy violations on our sites refer to Screen Names and specific jobs. So if you associate your name with your Screen Name, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your activities on the Site.</p>

<p>With respect to users who maintain accounts as Service Providers, the following information is also displayed to the public throughout the Site:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Company/Business Name.</li>
    <li>Business Description</li>
    <li>Submitted certifications, qualifications and similar information</li>
    <li>Feedback</li>
</ul>

<p>If you access our sites from a public or shared computer, certain information about you, such as your Screen Name, activity or reminders from us, may also be visible to other individuals who use the computer after you.</p>


<h2 id="toc6">Using Information from the Site</h2>
<p>The Site may enable you to share personal and financial information to complete transactions. We encourage you to disclose your privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users. We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information and therefore we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information. To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, location and financial information to facilitate your transactions. When users are involved in a transaction, they may have access to each other's name, Screen Name, email address and other contact and location information. In all cases, you must give other users a chance to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them.</p>

<p>You agree to use user information only for Fixr transaction-related purposes that are not unsolicited commercial messages, or other purposes that a user expressly chooses.</p>


<h2 id="toc7">Cookies</h2>
<p>We use "cookies" (small files placed on your hard drive) on certain of our pages to help analyze our web page flow; customize our services, content and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety.</p>

<p>A few important things you should know about cookies are that:</p>

<ul>
    <li>We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies.</li>
    <li>We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status.</li>
    <li>Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.</li>
    <li>You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of some or all of our sites or services.</li>
    <li>You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the sites that we do not control. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page.)</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="toc8">No Spam, Spyware or Spoofing</h2>
<p>We and our users do not tolerate spam. Make sure to set your notification preferences so we communicate to you as you prefer. You are not licensed to add other users, even a user with whom you've engaged in a transaction, to your mailing list (email or physical mail) without their express consent. To report Fixr-related spam or spoof emails, please forward the email to spam@fixr.com. You may not use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our Terms and Conditions. We may scan and filter messages to check for spam, viruses, phishing attacks and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited content, but we do not permanently store messages sent through these tools. If you use the Site to send an email to an email address that is not registered with us, we do not permanently store that email or use that email address for any marketing purpose. We do not rent or sell these email addresses.</p>


<h2 id="toc9">Account Protection</h2>
<p>Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose your password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify us and change your password.</p>


<h2 id="toc10">Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on to the Site. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms and Conditions, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.</p>


<h2 id="toc11">Security</h2>
<p>Your information is stored on our servers, which may be located within or outside the United States. We treat data as an asset to be protected and use a number of tools to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we strive to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</p>


<h2 id="toc12">Third Parties</h2>
<p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are users on our sites or other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable.</p>
