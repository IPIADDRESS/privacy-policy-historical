<h3><a name="Children_Under_13" id="Children_Under_13"></a>Children Under 13:</h3>
<p>Meredith cares about protecting the privacy of children.  	  We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide  	  us any personally identifying information. Children  	  should always get permission from their parents before  	  sending any information about themselves (such as  	  their names, email addresses, and phone numbers)  	  over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We encourage  	  you to become involved in your children's online  	  experience, and to share your interest in our sites  	  with your young ones. If you're under 13, please  	  do not register with any of our sites or provide  	  us with any personally identifying information (such  	  as your name, your email address or your phone number). </p>

<h3><a name="Information_We_Collect" id="Information_We_Collect"></a>Information We Collect:</h3>
<p>The information we gather on our sites falls into two   categories: (1) information you supply when you register or initiate   transactions, and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate   through our sites. Third-party providers featured on, or linked to from,   our sites, such as vendors of products and services offered through our   sites, may gather information, as well.</p>
<h4>Personally Identifying Information</h4>
<div>
  <p><strong>Registration Information.</strong> To use certain   features on our sites, we ask you to register. When you register, we   collect personally identifying information about you, including your   name, mailing address, email address, user name and password. We may   also ask for some additional information, such as, hobbies, age, browser   type, and the like, but you're free to register without providing this   information if you prefer. In addition, at various other points on our   sites, we may ask you for personally identifying information, including   when you: place an order for products, complete a survey, or report a   problem with one of our sites. We use this information to process your   orders, to tailor our sites to your interests and to make them more   useful to you, and to help improve our sites generally.</p>
  <p><strong>Contests and Other Promotions.</strong> From time to   time, we may offer contests or other promotions involving marketing or   advertising partners. If you choose to participate in one of these   contests or promotions, you'll have to provide some information about   yourself (such as your name, address, and email address). We may share   this information with sponsors of the contest or other promotional   partners, but we will always identify the other parties involved (for   example, in the contest rules) and provide notice that your registration   may be disclosed to these parties. We don't control these third   parties' privacy practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to   their collection and use of your information. We urge you to review   their privacy policies and learn how they will use your information   before participating. If you don't want us to collect the information   requested in connection with a promotion, or to provide it to our   co-sponsors or partners, please do not participate in the promotion.</p>
</div>
<h4>Tracking Information</h4>
<div>
  <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> To help us serve your            needs better, we use "cookies" to store and            sometimes to track user information. A cookie            is a small amount of data that is sent to            your browser from a web server and stored            on your computer's hard drive. A cookie contains            a unique number that allows our sites to            identify your computer. For example, cookies            allow us to keep track of your user name            and password (if you are a registered visitor)            so you don't have to re-enter that information            each time you visit one of our sites. We            also use cookies to make sure you don't see            the same ads repeatedly when you visit our            sites. The help function on most browsers            contains information on how to set your browser            to notify you before accepting cookies or            to disable cookies entirely. However, if            you don't accept cookies, you may not be            able to take advantage of various features            on our sites that are available to other            visitors. In addition, our advertising and            marketing partners may use their own cookies. </p>
  <p><strong>Third-Party Advertising Services.</strong> We            use the services of DoubleClick, a third-party            advertising and email delivery company            to serve and target advertisements that you see            on the pages of our sites, to serve and target            promotions or other marketing messages, and to            send e-mails from us. DoubleClick also collects "clickstream   data," information about your visit to our sites and to third-party   sites that can be aggregated and used to target advertising on this and   other sites, and used for marketing research and other similar purposes.   This clickstream data does not include personally identifying   information such as your name, address, email address or telephone   number. DoubleClick uses cookies for many of the same reasons we do, and   collects information directly from our users. We share website usage   information about visitors to our sites who have received a targeted   promotional campaign with DoubleClick to facilitate targeting future   campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting   statistics. For this purpose, we and DoubleClick note some of the pages   you visit on our website through the use of pixel tags (also called   "clear gifs" or "web beacons"). If you would like to know more about   DoubleClick information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures,            please see the privacy statement on the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;" target="_blank">DoubleClick website</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Browser Level Information and IP Addresses.</strong> When            you use our sites, we may also collect            information about your access time and your computer            configuration, including the type of browser            software you use, the operating system that you're            running, the resolution of your computer monitor            and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. Your            IP address is a number that is used by computers            connected to the Internet to identify your computer            so that data (such as the web pages you request)            can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell            us who you are. Like the IP address, none of the            other information described in this paragraph identifies            you personally. We collect this information for            purposes of aggregated reporting on site activity            that we, and our advertisers, may use. For example,            we may want to know how long the average user            spends on our site, which pages or features get            the most attention, and the like. The aggregated            information helps to understand our audience and            confirm the value of advertising on our websites.</p>

<h3><a name="How_your_information_will_be_used" id="How_your_information_will_be_used"></a>How Your Information Will Be Used:</h3>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you   with a customized experience when visiting our sites and to make our   sites more valuable to you. </p>
<div>
  <p><strong>Vendors and Service Providers.</strong> To            make your experience on our sites more useful and            enjoyable, we may offer some features (such as            chat rooms and email newsletters) in conjunction            with third party providers ("Provider Partners")            that specialize in operating such services. We            share with each of these Provider Partners such            information as is necessary to provide you with            the services we provide you in conjunction with            that Provider Partner. Their use of this information            will be subject to the terms of their respective            privacy policies, which you can find on their websites. <em>We   will not provide your email address to such third parties unless it's   necessary to provide the services you have requested, or to allow you to   participate in a co-sponsored promotion.</em> </p>
  <p><strong>Sites to Which We Link.</strong> We also may provide   links to other websites, and provide access to products and services   offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we don't control. When   you access another website or purchase products or services or conduct   other transactions through our websites, use of any information you   provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site   you're visiting or the provider of such products or services. When you   provide information in the course of obtaining products or services   through our sites, use of any information you provide may be governed by   the privacy policy of the provider of those products or services, even   if it appears that you're on one of our sites throughout the   transaction. The provider's privacy policy may differ from ours. If you   can't find the privacy policy of any of our providers via a link either   from the site's homepage or from the pages on which the products or   services are offered, you should contact the provider directly for more   information.</p>
  <p><strong>Shopping.</strong> When you are ready to make a   purchase through one of our sites, we will ask you to provide us with   certain information, including your contact details (such as your name,   address, telephone and email), and your billing information (such as   your credit card number and the date that your card expires). We will   use the information you provide us to process your transaction and to   contact you regarding your purchase if necessary. We will share this   information with the relevant merchant to the extent necessary to   facilitate your purchase (for purposes such as customer service,   verification, fulfillment and billing purposes). We may share   non-financial information with such merchants in accordance with this   Privacy Policy. </p>
  <p><strong>Our Other Websites.</strong> When you register for   one of our sites, the information that you provide will be added to a   centralized Meredith database so that you will simultaneously be   registered for our other sites as well. We may share the information   that we collect from you with other divisions of Meredith so that we and   they can offer you products and services that we may believe may be of   interest to you.</p>
  <p><strong>Postal Address Lists.</strong> If you provide us with   your postal address, we may include that address in postal address   lists that we sell or rent to third parties. If you would like us to   stop including your postal address in such lists, please send us a   letter (which should be addressed to Meredith Corporation, Opt-Out   Postal, Attn: Circulation, 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309),   requesting that we remove your postal address from these lists. If we   receive such a letter from you, we will act as promptly as possible to   remove your postal address from future postal address lists that we sell   or rent to third parties.</p>
  <p><strong>Other Disclosures.</strong> We may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our <a href="http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/fitness/file.jsp;?item=/legal/terms&amp;temp=no">Visitor Agreement</a>,   or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our sites,   the public, or Meredith Corporation. As our business grows, we may buy   or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that Meredith Corporation,   substantially all of our assets, or one or more of our sites (or   substantially all of its assets) is acquired by another company,   information on our visitors would be among the transferred assets. </p>

<div>
  <p><strong>Newsletters.</strong> We may offer you the   opportunity to subscribe to email newsletters on various topics that we   believe are of interest to our visitors. If you have opted to receive a   particular newsletter, you can always unsubscribe later either (1) by   following the 'unsubscribe' link located near the bottom of each   newsletter, or (2) by going to <a href="https://w1.buysub.com/servlet/CSGateway?cds_mag_code=FIT&amp;cds_page_id=78069">My Account</a>,            selecting "Unsubscribe" from the Newsletter options, unchecking the relevant boxes and pressing the "Update" button.</p>
  <p><strong>Promotional Emails.</strong> If you provide us with   your email address, from time to time we may send you emails about   Meredith products, services and special offers (such as special Meredith   magazine subscription offers) that we believe may be of interest to   you. When you register, you will also be given an opportunity to tell us   whether you would like to receive emails about products, services and   special offers from third-party providers. Though we hope that you will   find both types of promotional emails helpful, if you decide that you no   longer wish to receive either or both types of emails, please go to the <a href="https://secure.fitnessmagazine.com/common/profile/optout/">Email Preferences</a> page and update your preferences. Of course, you may change your   preferences at any time. We will make any changes you request as quickly   as we can.</p>

If you   don't want people to know your name or email address, for example, make   sure not to include it in any message you post publicly. Please see our <a href="http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/fitness/file.jsp;?item=/legal/terms&amp;temp=no">Visitor Agreement</a> for more information related to posting materials on our sites, including our use of such materials.</p>

<h2><a name="Your_California_Privacy_Policy" id="Your_California_Privacy_Policy"></a>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
<p><strong>(As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)</strong></p>
<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 ? also known as the   ?Shine the Light? law ?  California residents have a right to request   certain information from each business they patronize regarding that   business?s disclosures of personal information to third parties for the   third parties? direct marketing purposes.  Generally, if a business has   disclosed personal information regarding its California customers to   third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar   year, the business is required to provide, upon request and free of   charge, a list of the names and addresses of all such third parties,   together with a list of the categories of personal information that was   disclosed.</p>
<p>The ?Shine The Light? law creates an exception for businesses   that adopt and disclose to the public (in their privacy policies) a   policy of not sharing personal information for direct marketing purposes   without offering their customers choices to prevent such disclosures.    These businesses are not obligated to provide the lists described above   and may respond to requests from California customers by notifying them   of their rights to prevent disclosures of personal information for   direct marketing purposes and providing a cost-free means of exercising   those rights. </p>
<p>Meredith Corporation qualifies for this latter exception.  As further explained in our <a href="http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/fitness/file.jsp?item=/legal/privacy#Online_Privacy_Policy">Online Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/fitness/file.jsp?item=/privacy/policy">Offline          Privacy Policy</a>, we offer our customers choices to prevent   the disclosure of their personal information to third parties for the   third parties? direct marketing purposes.  To prevent such disclosures   of your information, please follow the instructions in our "Shine The   Light" Customer Notice, which is included below for your convenience.    You can also request a copy of this Notice by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@meredith.com">privacy@meredith.com</a>.    Please note that we are only required to respond to one request for   per California customer during the course of any calendar year and we   reserve the right not to respond to requests made by means other than   through this email address.</p>

<h2><a name="shinethelight" id="shinethelight"></a>MEREDITH CORPORATION "SHINE THE LIGHT" CUSTOMER NOTICE </h2>
<p>The following options are available to any customers who wish   to prevent the disclosure of their personal information to third parties   for direct marketing purposes:</p>
<div>
  <h4>Disclosures of Name and Postal Address Information. </h4>
  <p>If you subscribe to a magazine published by Meredith   Corporation, or if you otherwise provide us with your name and postal   address, we may share this information with other reputable companies   that offer products and services that we believe may be of interest to   you.  To remove your name and postal address from any marketing lists   that we sell or rent to third parties, complete the online <a href="http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/fitness/file.jsp?item=/privacy/policy">opt-out            form</a> or email your name and address to <a href="mailto:privacy@meredith.com">privacy@meredith.com</a>.    If you prefer to contact us by regular mail, send a postcard or letter   including your name and postal address to Meredith Corporation, Opt-out   Postal: Attn Circulation, 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309. </p>
  <h4>Disclosures of Website Registration Information.</h4>
  <p>When you register to become a member of one of our websites   and when you use our sites, you may be invited to sign up to receive   special offers from reputable third-party advertisers that we think may   be of interest to you.  If you choose to register for these offers, we   will share your registration information with the advertisers that   sponsor the offers you elect to receive.  To prevent the disclosure of   your registration information to these advertisers, please do not   register to receive third-party offers when you sign up for membership   and/or use our sites. </p>
  <p>Many of the third-party offers promoted through our websites   are brought to our visitors by a third-party agency, CoolSavings.com.    When you register to receive one or more offers from advertising clients   of CoolSavings.com, your information will be disclosed to   CoolSavings.com and CoolSavings.com may use your information and   disclose it to its client advertisers subject to its privacy policy at <a href="http://www.coolsavings.com" target="_blank">http://www.coolsavings.com</a>.    If you do not wish to receive third-party offers through   CoolSavings.com, please do not register for these offers when you use   our websites. </p>
  <h4>Disclosures of Sweepstakes and Contest Registration Information. </h4>
  <p>From time to time, we may offer co-sponsored sweepstakes,   contests and other promotions with third-party advertisers and other   partners.  We may share your registration information with third-parties   involved in a co-sponsored promotion, who will always be identified in   the promotion materials (for example, in the official rules).  If you do   not want your registration information to be disclosed to these   third-parties, please do not register for any of our co-sponsored   promotions.</p>
