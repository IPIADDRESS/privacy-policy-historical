            We also collect non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII” - for example, interests, hobbies,

            non-PII information on this web site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Non-PII may also be collected from you by means of Cookies and Pixel Tags. Cookies are small bits of

            address, email address or any personally identifying information. If you do not wish to receive relevant
            ads based on this technology, you can opt-out by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative’s

            This web site may also carry advertisements from other companies. Sears Holdings and its affiliates

            you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine,
            among other things, how they will handle any PII they collect from you. These third party advertisements
            may also contain cookies or web beacons. We do not control these third party cookies or web beacons
            and you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to see whether
            and how it uses cookies or web beacons.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not share any personally identifiable information about you with the advertising networks. To
