  <p>Fiji Times Online (FTO) recognises the importance of protecting the privacy
  of personally identifiable information collected about our customers. For the
  purposes of this Privacy Statement, the word customers includes visitors to
  our web sites, future subscribers to and users of our services, purchasers
  of our products and advertising customers.</p>
  <h4>Personal Information </h4>
  <p>Sometimes we collect personal information when we provide our services to you.
  Generally we will tell you why we are collecting information when we collect
  it and how we plan to use it or these things will be obvious when we collect
  the information.</p>
  <p>We usually collect personal information directly from you although at sometime
  we may use agents or service providers to do this for us. We may also acquire
  lists from other sources, both from other companies and from other public documents.</p>
  <h4>Use of Aggregate Data</h4>
  <p>We may collect certain non-personal information to optimise our goods and services
  including our Web pages for your computer (e.g., the identity of your Internet
  browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP address and the domain
  name of your Internet service provider). We may use such non-personal information
  for internal purposes, including but not limited to improving the content of
  our sites.</p>
  <p>FTO may use personally identifiable information in aggregate form to improve
  our goods and services including our Web sites and make them more responsive
  to the needs of our customers. This statistical compilation and analysis of
  information may also be used by FTO or provided to others as a summary report
  for marketing, advertising or research purposes.</p>
  <h4>Security</h4>
  <p>FTO strives to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personally identifiable
  information of our customers. We use a variety of physical and electronic security
  measures including restricting physical access to our offices and firewalls
  and secure databases to keep personal information secure from misuse, loss
  or unauthorised use or disclosure.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to
  be totally secure.</p>
  <h4>Public Information</h4>
  <p>Any information posted on bulletin boards and/or communicated in chat areas
  becomes public information. While FTO strives to protect and respect your privacy,
  we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose in a chat
  room or bulletin board.</p>
  <h4>Cookies</h4>
  <p>Cookies are data that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for
  record-keeping purposes. Cookies can facilitate a user's ongoing access to
  and use of a site. They allow us to track usage patterns and to compile data
  that can help us improve our content and target advertising. If you do not
  want information collected through the use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure
  in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the Cookie feature. But
  you should note that Cookies may be necessary to provide you with features
  such as web-site appearance and functionality.</p>
  <h4>Online Links to Third Party and Co-Branded Sites</h4>
  <p>FTO may establish relationships with business partners that allow visitors
  to our Internet sites to link directly to sites operated by these partners.
  Some of these sites may be "co-branded" with our logo; however, these
  sites may not be operated or maintained by or on our behalf. These sites may
  collect personal information from you that may be shared with us. This Privacy
  Statement will apply to any personal information we obtain in this manner.</p>
  <p>FTO is not responsible for the content or practices of Web sites operated by
  third parties that are linked to our sites. These links are meant for the user's
  convenience only. Links to third party sites do not constitute sponsorship,
  endorsement or approval by FTO of the content, policies or practices of those
  third party sites. Once you have left our site via such a link, you should
  check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site.</p>
  <h4>What else you should know about privacy on the Internet</h4>
  <p>Remember to close your browser when you have finished your user session. This
  is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence
  if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public
  place like a library or Internet caf√©. You as an individual are responsible
  for the security of and access to your own computer.</p>
  <p>Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information over the Internet that
  this information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post
  personal information in publicly accessible online forums, you may receive
  unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely
  responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username and passwords and
  any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are
  using the Internet.</p>
  <p>Please note the contents of this privacy statement may change as features are
  added to the site.</p>
