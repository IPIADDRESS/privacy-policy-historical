      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When you provide us with information, you
      can be sure that we will hold that information in strict confidence. We
      recognize and respect your expectation that privacy be protected.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We may share information with an outside
      company that assists us in providing customers with our products and
      services. These companies act on our behalf and are also obligated to keep
      the information that we provide them confidential. We do not share
      customer information with outside companies for purposes of selling their
      products and services to you, unless you have been given the opportunity
      in advance to decline this option.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Information may also be exchanged with
      consumer reporting agencies and provided when legally required or
      permitted in connection with litigation, fraud investigation, or an
      acquisition or sale.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our employees access information about you
      only when needed to maintain your accounts or otherwise meet your needs.
      We use proven technology and established procedures for keeping your
      information secure. Whenever we ask for personal information on our
      Website or Online Banking we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL technology)
      128-bit encryption to keep it confidential.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You may visit our website to find out about
      products and services, marketing information, and career opportunities
      without providing any information about yourself. We do gather data
      regarding visits to our Website, including domain name, pages visited,
      length of user session, etc., to evaluate the usefulness of our site.&nbsp;<br>
      The bank may use a software "cookie" when accessing our online
      banking product. No "cookie" will contain any information that
      would enable anyone to contact you via telephone, email, or U.S. Mail. (A
      "cookie" is a small piece of information which a Website stores
      in the web browser of your PC and can later retrieve. A "cookie"
      cannot be read by a web site other than the one that set the
      "cookie". You can set your web browser to inform you when
      "cookies" are set or to prevent "cookies" from being
      set.)&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We do not knowingly solicit data from
      children, and we do not knowingly market to children. We recognize that
      protecting children's identities and privacy online is important and that
      the responsibility to do so rests with both the online industry and with
      parents.</font></p>
