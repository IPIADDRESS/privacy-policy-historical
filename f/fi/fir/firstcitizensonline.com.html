                <ul>
                  <li>  We do not sell our customer

                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This notice describes our consumer 
                  privacy policies and practices and also certain rights you have 
                  under federal law. It summarizes what information we collect, 
                  how we use it, with whom we share it and what we do to protect 
                  it. These policies and practices are intended to protect the 
                  confidentiality of your information if you obtained financial 
                  products or services from us primarily for personal, family 
                  or household purposes. They apply with equal force to both current 
                  and former customers. When we use the term "information" in 
                  this notice, we mean information that is personal to you and 
                  not otherwise publicly available. The policies and practices 
                  described in this notice do not apply to or protect information 
                  about you that is publicly available, information about business 
                  entities, or information about individuals who obtain financial 
                  products or services for business, commercial or agricultural 
                  purposes.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>We Collect and Use Information Responsibly.</b><br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We limit the information we collect 
                  about you to information we need to administer our business 
                  and provide you with high quality financial products and services. 
                  We use information about you to administer your accounts, process 
                  your transactions, serve your financial needs, determine your 
                  eligibility for other products and services we offer and provide 
                  you with information about products, services and other opportunities 
                  that may interest you. The types of information we collect include: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>  Information about your experiences 
                    and transactions with us, with our affiliates or with others. 
                    For example, this information may include your account balance, 
                    payment history, or credit card usage. </li>
                  <li>  Information you provide us 
                    on applications, personal financial statements or in other 
                    oral, written or electronic communications. For example, this 
                    information may include your name, address, Social Security 
                    number, employer, assets and income. However, the only information 
                    we collect about you through our websites is information you 
                    voluntarily provide. </li>
                  <li>  Information we receive from 
                    consumer reporting agencies (credit bureaus). For example, 
                    this information may include your credit history, credit score 
                    and other information about your creditworthiness. </li>
                  <li>  Information we obtain from 
                    market research organizations to learn more about you and 
                    your financial needs. For example, this information may include 
                    demographic information about the neighborhood in which you 
                    live. </li>
                </ul>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Note: Medical 
                  information obtained as part of an application for insurance 
                  is shared only with those within our organization who require 
                  access to process the application. Additional standards of confidentiality 
                  protect information related to trust and fiduciary services.&nbsp;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  <b>We Limit Employee Access to Your Confidential Information.&nbsp;</b><br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All employees are governed by a Code 
                  of Conduct that includes the responsibility to protect the confidentiality 
                  of our customers' financial information and other personal information. 
                  Employees are bound by this Privacy Policy and are also educated 
                  on implementing our organization's security policies and practices. 
                  Only employees actively engaged in their assigned duties are 
                  permitted access to or use of customer information.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>We Share Information Within Our Organization to Serve You 
                  Better.&nbsp;</b><br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opportunities arise when we can serve 
                  you more efficiently and make it easier for you to do business 
                  with us by sharing information about you within our organization 
                  . For example, if you have an account with one of our affiliates 
                  and want to open an account with another, you may not have to 
                  furnish application information twice.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As permitted by federal law, we routinely 
                  share within our organization information needed to identify 
                  and contact you as well as information about your transactions 
                  and experiences with us. In addition, unless you tell us not 
                  to, we may share other information (which we call "non-experience 
                  information") about you within our organization, including: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>  Information we obtain from 
                    your applications, personal financial statements or other 
                    forms, such as your income or marital status; </li>
                  <li>  Information we obtain from 
                    a consumer report or a credit bureau, such as your credit 
                    history or your credit score; </li>
                  <li>  Information we obtain to 
                    verify your representations to us, such as open lines of credit 
                    you may have with others; and </li>
                  <li>  Information we obtain from 
                    others regarding employment, credit or other relationships 
                    you may have with them, such as your employment history. </li>
                </ul>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Companies 
                  in our organization who may receive this information are financial 
                  service providers, such as our insurance affiliates.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>How to Tell Us Not to Share Non-Experience Information.</b><br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you ask us not to share non-experience 
                  information within our corporate family, you may miss out on 
                  financial products and services of interest to you. However, 
                  if you prefer that we refrain from sharing non-experience information, 
                  you may direct us not to by calling us at <b>1-888-612-4444</b>. 
                  When two or more customers jointly obtain a financial product 
                  or service from us, we will treat a request not to share non-experience 
                  information made by one of the joint customers as applying to 
                  all of the joint customers. We will process your request as 
                  quickly as we can.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>We Disclose Information to Nonaffiliated Third Parties Only 
                  as Permitted by Law.&nbsp;</b><br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not disclose information about 
                  you to anyone outside our organization without your consent 
                  except as permitted by law. For example: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>  We disclose information necessary 
                    or appropriate to process your transactions and to maintain 
                    and service your accounts with us. </li>
                  <li>  We disclose information about 
                    your experiences with us to credit bureaus in accordance with 
                    well-established banking practices and the federal Fair Credit 
                    Reporting Act. </li>
                  <li>  We may disclose information 
                    necessary to protect against fraud or loss. </li>
                  <li>  We may disclose information 
                    in response to a subpoena or court order. </li>
                </ul>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We routinely 
                  use outside companies to assist us in administering your accounts 
                  and in the day-to-day conduct of our business. For example, 
                  other companies perform specialized support services for us 
                  or on our behalf when they print checks for you, help us process 
                  your transactions and service your accounts, and assist us in 
                  our marketing efforts.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes we enter into joint marketing 
                  agreements with other financial institutions to offer you products 
                  or services we do not currently offer. We may disclose any of 
                  the information we collect as described above to companies that 
                  perform services (including marketing services) for us or on 
                  our behalf and to other financial institutions with which we 
                  have joint marketing agreements. However, when we do so: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>  We choose our business partners 
                    carefully and deal only with reputable companies; </li>
                  <li>  We limit the information 
                    we share to the information the company needs to do the job; 
                    and </li>
                  <li>  The company is required by 
                    law or contract to preserve the confidentiality of your information 
                    and to restrict its use to the purposes intended. The company 
                    cannot use your information for its own purposes. </li>
                </ul>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also provide 
                  your information to others when you give us permission to do 
                  so. For example, if you fill out a card we sent you requesting 
                  more information about an insurance product offered by a non-affiliated 
                  company we told you about, we would forward your request including 
                  your name and address to that company. Of course, if you change 
                  your mind you can always "opt-out" of that disclosure by calling 
                  us at <b>1-888-612-4444</b>. If you did that, we would not share 
                  that information.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Other Privacy Protections.</b><br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may have additional privacy rights 
                  in the future under the laws of South Carolina or the state 
                  in which you reside, and we may be required to send you additional 
                  notices or disclosures. We will comply with all applicable state 
                  and federal laws that protect the privacy of your information.&nbsp;<br>
