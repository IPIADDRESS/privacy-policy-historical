<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
Thank you for using Firecracker! This Privacy Policy provides Firecracker’s
(“we” or “our”) policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing
your information.  Users can access our website and services (the “Services”)
through our website www.firecracker.me, applications on Devices, through APIs,
and through third-parties.  A “Device” is any computer used to access our
Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet,
or other consumer electronic device.  This Privacy Policy governs your access
of the our Services, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services
you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and
other uses described in this Privacy Policy.  All of the different forms of
data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to
as “information.”
</p>
<p>
If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact
us by e-mail at
<a href="mailto:chat@firecracker.me">chat@firecracker.me.</a>
</p>
<h4>Information We Collect &amp; How We Use It</h4>
<p>
Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a
safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience.  This allows us to provide
Services that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our Services to
make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information
about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.
</p>
<p>
In general, you can browse our Services without telling us who you are or
revealing any personal information about yourself.  Once you give us your
personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us.
</p>
<h4>Information You Choose to Share</h4>
<p>
In order to use some of our Services, you must first complete the registration
form and create a username and password.  During registration, you are required
to give truthful contact information (such as a valid email address) in accordance
with our Terms of Service.  We use this information to contact you about Services
in which you have expressed interest.
</p>
<p>
Your information also includes the information you choose to share on our website,
such as when you post a message, add notes in a module, upload a photo, or comment
on another user's post.  Your information also includes the information you choose
to share when you take an action, such as when you add a friend to your group.
We may also receive information about you from the modules, exercises, and other
services you use that we provide on the Websites.
</p>
<h3>Information We Collect To Respond To Your Choices and Requests</h3>
<p>
<em>Orders</em>
</p>
<p>
If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable
information from you on our order form.  You must provide contact information (such as
your email address) and financial information (such as a credit card number and expiration
date).  We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have
trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.
</p>
<p>
<em>Surveys or Contests</em>
</p>
<p>
We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our website.
If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you.
The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping
address) and demographic information.
</p>
<p>
We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor traffic on
our website, or to personalize our services (in the case of anonymous information collected
in surveys).
</p>
<p>
<em>Tell-A-Friend</em>
</p>
<p>
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Website,
we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically
send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Website.
Firecracker Inc. will store this information for the sole purpose of sending
this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.  Your
friend may contact us at
<a href="mailto:chat@firecracker.me">chat@firecracker.me</a>
to request that we remove this information from our database.
</p>
<p>
<em>Posting in Public Message Areas</em>
</p>
<p>
If you choose to post messages in our public message areas (whether restricted
to a select group or to the general public) or leave feedback for other users,
we will collect the information you post. We may receive information about you
from other users, who post content about you in a forum. We retain this information
as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems
as permitted by law. We reserve the right to terminate the accounts of visitors
who use these services in a manner inconsistent with our Terms of Service.
</p>
<p>
When we use the phrase "public information", we mean the information you choose
to disclose to other uses of our Services, as well as information that is always
publicly available. By posting information in a public message area, you are
choosing to make your information public.
</p>
<p>
Choosing to make your information public also means that this information:
</p><ol>
<li>Can be associated with you (i.e., your name, profile picture, Firecracker profile, username, etc.)</li>
<li>Can show up when someone does a search on Firecracker</li>
<li>When others share information about you, they can also choose to make it public.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>
The types of information listed below are by default publicly available, and are
treated just like information you decided to make public.
</p><ol>
<li>
Name: When you post information in a public message area your Nickname will be
associated with the message.  Other users may find your Nickname by searching for
it through the Services.
</li>
<li>
Profile Pictures: This helps other users recognize you. If you are uncomfortable
making your profile picture public, you can always delete it by hovering over your
photo and clicking "Change Picture." A default profile picture will be assigned to
your profile until you select one.
</li>
<li>
Custom Created Groups: Firecracker allows you to create custom groups of other
users to share information. Custom groups may include study groups, friends, classmates,
communities, or other groups (“Custom Group”). This helps you see whom you will be
sharing information with before you choose a Custom Group as a custom audience to a post.
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h4>Information We Collect About Anonymous Visitors</h4>
<p>
We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Website.
We use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests,
and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community.
</p>
<p>
<em>Log Files</em>
</p>
<p>
Like many Websites, we automatically gather certain information about our Website
traffic and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP)
addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages,
operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information,
which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Website,
to track users’ movements around the Website and to gather demographic information about
our user base.  We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable
information.  We may use a third-party tracking service that uses log files and cookies,
see below, to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to the Website
in the aggregate. This service captures usage and volume statistics to improve the usage
of our Website and to track responses to marketing efforts.
</p>
<p>
<em>Cookies</em>
</p>
<p>
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping
purposes. We may use cookies on this Website. As noted above, we do not link the
information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit
while on our Website. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by the Website
only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
</p>
<p>
We use session ID cookies on certain portions of our Website.  A session ID cookie
expires when you close your browser. We may use session cookies to make it easier
for you to navigate our Website.  In addition, our third party analytics provider,
if any, may use cookies to track movement on non-secure portions of the Website.
We have no access to or control over these cookies.  If you reject cookies, you may
still use our Website, but your ability to use some areas of our Website, such as
contests or surveys, may be limited.  Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers)
use cookies on our Website. We have no access to or control over these cookies.
See “Third Party Advertisers.”
</p>
<p>
<em>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</em>
</p>
<p>
We may employ a software technology called clear gifs, also referred to as web beacons
or web bugs that help manage content on the Website by tracking what content is
effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in
function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive,
clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the
period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by
clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.  We may use
clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have
opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and
the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of
these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.” Communication from Us or the Website
</p>
<p>
<em>Special Offers &amp; Updates</em>
</p>
<p>
We may occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals,
and promotions. We may provide a registration page on which you can sign up to
receive such emails from us. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option
not to receive these types of communications. Please see the “Choice and Opt-out.”
</p>
<p>
<em>Service-Related Announcements</em>
</p>
<p>
We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when
it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended
for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of
these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to
receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.
</p>
<p>
<em>Customer Service</em>
</p>
<p>
Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send
you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will communicate
with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request,
and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone,
in accordance with your wishes.
</p>
<p>
<em>Profile</em>
</p>
<p>
We may store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs,
and/or third party sources to create a “profile” of your preferences. We do not
tie your personally identifiable information, or your purchasing history, to
information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing
offers and to improve the content of the Website for you.  We do not share your
profile with other third parties.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Conditions Under Which We Share Information Aggregate Information (Non-Personally
Identifiable)
</em>
</p>
<p>
We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners.
This information does not identify individual users. We do not link aggregate user
data with personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
In addition, data may be aggregated regarding assessment of your performance based on
various measures to create generalized data regarding use of our platform. We may
use and publicize such aggregate information on any basis that does not identify you,
without your consent. Your contributions or notes to a module, forum, or other service
on our website (“Contribution”) may also be aggregated and made publicly available.
Your Contributions may be aggregated according to their registration and login status.
</p>
<p>
<em>Personally Identifiable Information</em>
</p>
<p>
Except as discussed in this Privacy Policy, we do not share personally identifiable
information with third parties.
</p>
<p>
<em>Agents</em>
</p>
<p>
We use a a credit card processing company to bill you for our Services.  These companies
do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.
</p>
<p>
<em>Service Providers</em>
</p>
<p>
We use other third parties to provide mapping solutions on the Website. When you sign up
for any of our services, we will share location that you enter as necessary for the third
party to provide that service.
</p>
<p>
<em>Legal Disclaimer</em>
</p>
<p>
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by
law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights; to comply with a
judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us or the Website; or in connection
with an actual or proposed corporate transaction or insolvency proceeding involving all or
part of the business or asset to which the information pertains.
</p>
<p>
<em>Choice/Opt-out</em>
</p>
<p>
We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information
used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase one
of our Services but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can
indicate your preference in your “notification preferences.”  If you no longer wish to receive
our newsletter and promotional communications, if any, you may opt-out of receiving them by
following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at
<a href="mailto:chat@firecracker.me">chat@firecracker.me.</a>

Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy policies of such other sites.  We
encourage you to be aware when you leave our website and to read the privacy policies of each
and every website that collects personally identifiable information.  This Privacy Policy
applies only to information collected through our Services.

<p>
<em>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</em>

may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page

<p>
<em>Security</em>
</p>
<p>
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information

using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  We follow generally accepted industry standards to
protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information,
we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  If you have any questions about security on our Website,
