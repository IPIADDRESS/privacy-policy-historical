            Overview</b><br>
            Firetalk Communications, Inc. is strongly committed to protecting
            the privacy of members of the Firetalk community and of visitors to
            the Firetalk Web site. One of our primary objectives is to provide a
            safe and secure environment for you to communicate with other
            Firetalk members using the suite of interactive tools that we
            provide. We are equally concerned about protecting any information
            you provide us. The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you,
            as a welcome member of the Firetalk community: (1) what kinds of
            information we may gather about you when you visit the Firetalk Web
            site or use the Firetalk application, (2) how we may use that
            information, (3) whether we disclose it to anyone, (4) the choices
            you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct the
            information and, (5) what security precautions are in place to
            protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your information. Finally,
            please note that this policy applies only to Firetalk, not to any of
            our partners Web sites, or any other companies' or organizations'
            Web sites to which you may link from our Web site or through the
            Talk &amp; Surf button on your Firetalk application.</font>
            <p align="right"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="#top"><img border="0" src="../images/page_layout/btn_top.gif" width="36" height="11"></a></font></p>
            <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What
            personal information does Firetalk collect?</font></b></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#808080">Information
            collected during registration</font></b><br>
            Registering a Firetalk account is an easy two-step process. During
            step 1 of registration, Firetalk collects certain personal
            information from you including your e-mail address, the nickname you
            would like associated with your Firetalk account, your first and
            last name, birth date, gender, country of origin, and zip code.
            Furthermore, you have the option of providing us with additional
            information including your company's name (if applicable),
            occupation, the speed of your Internet connection, a favorite
            personal saying, where you heard about Firetalk, the number of
            children in your household, and whether you own your own business.
            This additional information is not required for you to obtain a
            Firetalk account. In order to complete step 1 of registration you
            must also carefully read and accept our Terms and Conditions. These
            are the general guidelines that govern your conduct as a member of
            the Firetalk community and we hope that you take them seriously.
            Step 2 of registration is entirely optional. If you choose, you may
            check the appropriate boxes in order to receive free promotional
            information via e-mail on topics of general interest to you. We also
            give you the opportunity to receive a one-time promotional e-mail
            about certain hot new products. Once you submit your registration
            information to Firetalk, we will e-mail you your Firetalk password
            and a Firetalk user ID. You are free to change your Firetalk
            password at any time. You will need both a Firetalk password and
            Firetalk user ID to log into the Firetalk service. Firetalk plans to
            derive a significant portion of its revenue from advertising. As a
            result, collecting this information during registration is important
            not only for purposes of effectively administering the Firetalk
            service but also for delivering more personalized advertisements to
            you and continuing to make the Firetalk service free to the Firetalk
            community. Firetalk shall collect data based on your responses to
            and interest in such advertising.</font></p>
            <p align="right"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="#top"><img border="0" src="../images/page_layout/btn_top.gif" width="36" height="11"></a></font></p>

            Information</font></b><br>
            Firetalk may collect additional personal information from time to
            time in order to give you the opportunity: (i) to participate in
            special events, sweepstakes, contests or other Firetalk-sponsored
            promotions, or (ii) to fill out user surveys that we use for
            research purposes. Firetalk may retain in its database personal
            information collected from you during your participation in the
            above-listed opportunities and registration for an indefinite period
            of time. Also, Firetalk automatically updates software used in
            conjunction with its services. In order to periodically update
            versions of the Firetalk software, we first collect the user's
            current version information from their hard drive. This information
            is not archived by Firetalk and is only used to determine which
            software modules within the Firetalk application require updating.
            In addition, Firetalk's customer service representatives are
            instructed not to ask for personal information from our users
            through the Firetalk service. If we need additional information that
            you did not provide during registration (such as your telephone
            number or mailing address), we will ask you to send it to an e-mail
            address at Firetalk. However, you are under no obligation to provide
            such information.</font>

            Firetalk only has one cookie on its Web site and it is used for a
            very limited purpose. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web

            purposes. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you'll find
            them at most major Web sites. The cookie used by Firetalk on its Web
            site shows us whether you found out about Firetalk from one of our
            Internet advertisements. As a result, we are able to better
            determine how successful our advertising and promotional campaigns
            have been. This cookie immediately disappears from your hard drive

            cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not
            originally sent in a cookie. Firetalk does not use cookies to
            identify specific individuals. You may occasionally get cookies from
            our advertisers. Firetalk does not control these cookies. The use of
            advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the
            Internet industry. Most browsers are initially set to accept
            cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to
            alert you when cookies are being sent.</font>

            We may provide personal information we collect from you to
            third-party advertisers to enable such parties to deliver
            advertisements and promotions to you through e-mail, the Firetalk
            Web site and the Firetalk application. In addition, if you acquire
            the Firetalk application from a third party (not <a href="http://www.firetalk.com">www.firetalk.com</a>)
            with whom you have an existing relationship (e.g. your Internet
            Service Provider), we may be required to provide that third party
            with your registration information, but only in the few exceptional
            cases where this is a contractual obligation between Firetalk and
            the third party and only in the case that the third party has agreed
            not to provide your personal information to another party without
            your prior written consent. Firetalk maintains publicly available
            user profiles as well, which may contain personally identifying
            information volunteered by members of the Firetalk community. Except
            as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Firetalk will not
            disclose any of your personal information unless we have your
            permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe
            in good faith that the law requires it.</font>

            does Firetalk do with the information it collects?</b><br>
            Firetalk may use personal information collected from its members to
            award prizes, track compliance with our Terms and Conditions, and
            serve advertisements that are tailored to your interests. In
            addition, Firetalk may disclose personally identifying information
            about you, your Firetalk account, or any content you provide through
            the Firetalk service to the appropriate authorities, if Firetalk
            believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to
            enforce its End-User Software License Agreement, Terms and
            Conditions, Privacy Policy, copyright policy, to comply with the
            law, to comply with legal process, to operate its systems properly,
            or to protect the rights or property of itself, its members, its
            visitors, or others. As we mentioned above, you may check boxes
            during registration in order to control whether your e-mail address
            may be viewed by other members of the Firetalk community and
            determine whether we send you Firetalk news updates, free
            promotional information or additional information about Firetalk's
            partner program via e-mail. At any time, you may request to
            discontinue receiving e-mails (including Firetalk updates and free
            promotional information) by simply replying to the e-mail and
            specifying your desire to unsubscribe. If you do not want any of the
            information we collect to be shared with the third parties described
            in this Privacy Policy, you may decide not to use the Firetalk
            service. Also, please keep in mind that when you use voice and text
            chat during conference calls, moderated interactive broadcasts, in
            Firetalk Forums, on the Firetalk Web site or on any other Web site
            while using Talk &amp; Surf, all information volunteered by you is
            displayed or broadcast publicly to the other Firetalk members who

            pursuant to the interests you checked during registration, simply
            uncheck the applicable boxes and they will no longer be delivered to
