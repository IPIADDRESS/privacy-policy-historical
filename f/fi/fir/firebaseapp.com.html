		<p>
		<strong>Firebase</strong> values your privacy. At www.firebase.com we offer a real-time backend-as-a-service
		for powering cloud apps.  In this Privacy Policy ("Policy"), we describe how we collect, use, and disclose information
		that we obtain about visitors to our website https://www.firebase.com (the "Site") and the services available through
		our Site (collectively, the "Services").
		</p>

		<p>
		By visiting the Site, or using any of our Services, you agree that your personal information will be handled as
		described in this Policy.  Your use of our Site or Services, and any dispute over privacy, is subject to this
		Policy and our Terms of Service, available below, including its applicable limitations on damages and the
		resolution of disputes.  The Firebase Terms of Service are incorporated by reference into this Policy.
		</p>

		<h3>What Information Do We Collect About You and Why?</h3>

		in order to improve our Site and Services and respond to user desires and preferences, and for other research and
		analytical purposes.
		</p>

		<h3>How We Share Your Information</h3>

		<p>
		We may share the information that we collect about you, including personally identifiable information, as follows:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Affiliates</strong> We may disclose the information we collect from you to our affiliates or subsidiaries; however, if we
				do so, their use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information will be subject to this Policy.
				Service Providers.  We may disclose the information we collect from you to third party vendors, service providers,
				contractors or agents who perform functions on our behalf.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Business Transfers</strong> If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets
				are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information we have
				collected from you to the other company.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>In Response to Legal Process</strong> We also may disclose the information we collect from you in order to comply with
				the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena.
			</li>

			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Aggregate and De-Identified Information</strong> We may share aggregate or de-identified information about users with

			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms</h3>

		<p>
		We use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Site or Services.
		We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you.  Cookies are alphanumeric
		identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.
		Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a
		faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service.
		There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Session Cookies</strong> Session cookies exist only during an online session.  They disappear from your computer
			when you close your browser or turn off your computer.  We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely
			identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site.  This allows us to process your online
			transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Persistent cookies</strong> Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off
			your computer.  We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Third Party Cookies</h4>
		<p>
		We may also engage third parties to track and analyze Site data.
		We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Site
		and to analyze Site usage.  Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with
		other information that they have collected.  This Policy does not cover such third parties' use of the data.
		</p>

		<h4>Disabling Cookies</h4>
		<p>
		Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser
		options to block them in the future.  The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent
		your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie,
		or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse
		certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.
		</p>

		<h4>Third Party Analytics</h4>

		<p>
		We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage
		of our Site.  We also may use other analytic means to evaluate
		our Services.  We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences.
		We do not share your personal information with these third parties.
		</p>

		<h3>Third-Party Links</h3>

		<p>
		Our Site and Services may contain links to third-party websites.  Any access to and use of such linked websites
		is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites.
		We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.
		</p>

		<h3>Security of My Personal Information</h3>

		<p>
		We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions, including, where appropriate,
		password protection, encryption, SSL, firewalls, and internal restrictions on who may access data to protect the
		information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
		Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.
		</p>

		<p>
		You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other
		things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or
		can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private.  We are not responsible for any lost, stolen,
		or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
		</p>

		<h3>Access To My Personal Information</h3>

		<p>
		You may modify personal information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your
		profile information. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted may
		remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site for a period of time.
		</p>

		<h4>What Choices Do I Have Regarding Use of My Personal Information?</h4>

		<p>
		We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you. You may opt-out of such communications
		by following the opt-out instructions contained in the e-mail.  Please note that it may take up to 10 business days
		for us to process opt-out requests.  If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information
		we think may interest you, we may still send you e-mails about your account or any Services you have
		requested or received from us.
		</p>

		<h3>Children Under 13</h3>

		<p>
		Our Services are not designed for children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us
		with personal information, we will delete such information from our systems.
		</p>

		<h3>Contact Us</h3>

		This Policy is current as of the Effective Date set forth above.  We may change this Policy from time to time,
		so please be sure to check back periodically.  We will post any changes to this Policy on our Site, at
		www.firebase.com.  If we make any changes to this Policy that materially affect our practices with regard
		to the personal information we have previously collected from you, we will endeavor to provide you with notice in
		advance of such change by highlighting the change on our Site.
