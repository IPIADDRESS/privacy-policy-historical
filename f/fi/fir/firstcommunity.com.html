First Community Credit Union<br>
Privacy Policy
</b></h3>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>
<b>Introduction</b>
First Community Credit Union recognizes and respects how important personal privacy is to you.  Because of our interest in
protecting your privacy, we continually examine the operating practices and procedures of our organization.  First Community
Credit Union has adopted the following privacy policy, continuing in our commitment to provide quality service to you, our
valued member. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Recognition of Our Member's Expectation of Privacy</b>
First Community Credit Union recognizes that our members expect and deserve privacy and security for their personal and
financial matters.  We understand the need to safeguard the sensitive information that our members have entrusted to us.  We
maintain standards and procedures designed to protect the misuse of this information. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Our Collection, Use and Retention of Member Information</b>
We collect, use and retain information about our members only where we reasonably believe it would be useful in
administering our business, by providing products and services, and other opportunities to our members.  We collect and
retain information only for specific business purposes and will tell you why we are collecting and retaining it upon your
request.  You may contact the credit union at the address and phone number shown below.  We use information to protect and
administer our members' records, accounts, and funds; to comply with certain laws and regulations; to help design or improve
our products and services; to understand the financial needs to appropriately market our services and provide quality
products and outstanding service. And this information will not be reused.  Although we may disclose account information to
our vendors that assist the Credit Union in completing transactions, we do not share any of our information with any
business partners for their sole marketing purposes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Our Maintenance of Accurate Information</b>
We have implemented procedures to help assure that our members' financial information is accurate, current, and complete in
accordance with commercial standards.  While some procedures are required by federal or state law, we also have procedures
for responding to requests to correct inaccurate information in a timely manner, and to update information and remove old
information.  Members should notify us immediately if they receive information regarding their relationship with the credit
union that they believe to be inaccurate.  You may contact the credit union at the address and phone number shown below. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Limiting Employee Access to Information</b>
We have procedures and security levels in place that limit employee access to personally identifiable information to
those with a business reason to know such information.  We educate our employees on the importance of confidentiality and
member privacy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Protection of Information</b>
We maintain security standards and procedures to help prevent unauthorized access to confidential member information.  We
update and test our technology to improve the protection of our member information and to assure the integrity of our
information.
</p>

<p>
<b>Restrictions on the Disclosures of Account Information</b>
First Community Credit Union shares information regarding members only in accordance with strict confidentiality policies
and with applicable law.  Third parties are not given access to account access numbers (such as PIN numbers) or similar
access numbers for marketing purposes.  We do not reveal specific information about our members' accounts or other
personally identifiable data to unaffiliated parties for their independent use, unless (1) our member has requested it; (2)
the information is provided to help complete a transaction initiated by our member; (3) the information is provided to a
reputable credit bureau or similar information reporting agency; or (4) disclosure is lawfully permitted or required.  The
above applies both to current members, and to those persons who are no longer members of the Credit Union. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Maintaining Member Privacy in Business Relationships with Outside Third Parties</b>
At times it is necessary to provide personally identifiable information about our members to a third party, such as a vendor
that we hire to prepare your account statements.  All third-party vendors agree to safeguard our confidential member
information, are not permitted to reuse information for unauthorized purposes, and must abide by applicable law.
</p>

<p>
<b>Online Personal Information</b>
This section describes the circumstances under which we may receive personal information online. 
</p>

<p>
First Community Credit Union is committed to the highest level of security and privacy regarding the collection and use of
our online account access (using Expressnet) members' personal information, as well as that of all visitors to our web site.
Personal information may be collected through the submission of account applications, online account access transactions, or
through the use of online financial tools such as interactive calculators.  Visitors may also voluntarily provide us with
personal information via e-mail, drawing registrations, web surveys, online registration, guestbook or contact forms.  This
information is handled internally by our staff to process the visitor's request.  First Community Credit Union does use
standard Web tracking software to collect nonidentifying information about our visitors, such as:     
</p>
<pre>    Date and time our site was accessed 
    City, state and country 
    Web browser used 
    IP address (a numeric address given to servers connected to the internet)
</pre>

<p>
The credit union uses this information to create summary statistics and to determine the level of interest in our web site. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Website Links</b>
The internet contains many useful resources, and First Community Credit Union contains links to other websites. First Community Credit Union is not responsible for the privacy practices, content or availability of the linked websites. We also encourage users to read the privacy statement of all linked websites to become acquainted with their specific privacy practices. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Protecting Children</b>
First Community Credit Union recognizes that protecting children's identities and privacy online is important and that the responsibility rests with both the online industry and the parents. The Credit Union does not collect any personal information on children through its website, but does offer online links through the website to various child-oriented sites. Please be advised that any site collecting information from children under the age of 13 must conform to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA).
</p>

<p>
<b>Online Banking Pages</b>
To ensure your privacy and financial security, we require that you enter a password before you may log onto our online
account access service.  Account access pages are encrypted using "Secure Socket Layer" (SSL).  To ensure valid navigation
access from your computer to our host servers we employ the use of "Cookies".  Cookies are small pieces of information that
are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive.  These also allow us to know if you have visited the site before.
Our Cookies do not contain any information that would identify you personally.  You can generally configure your web browser
to block cookies, but doing so may restrict your access to any secured site, including ours.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your E-Mail Privacy</b>
First Community Credit Union's web site does not require you to disclose any personal identifying information.  If, however,
you choose to contact us via e-mail, please keep in mind that your e-mail address, and any other information your e-mail
header shows about you, such as your name or organization, will be revealed to us in the e-mail.  We pledge, however, that
when you communicate with us via e-mail, we will use your e-mail information only for the specific purpose of responding to
your comments or questions.  Your e-mail address will not be sold nor will it be shared with others outside the credit union
unless we are compelled to do so by law.
</p>

<p>
<b>Disclosing Our Privacy Commitment to Our Members</b>
We reserve the right to change this policy at any time by posting a new privacy policy.  This policy will be changed when
required by law or regulation.  Members will be notified of this policy at least annually when they join the Credit Union,

statement, you may write or phone us at:
