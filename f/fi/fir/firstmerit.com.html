              Following is the Privacy Policy for the FirstMerit affiliated companies 
              listed on the back, of which you are a customer, and with which 
              you may have a relationship in the future. This Policy also applies 
              to future FirstMerit affiliated companies. In this Policy, "we," 
              "us," or "our" means the FirstMerit entity(ies) 
              with which you have a relationship, and "you" or "your" 
              means the individual customer who has the relationship. FirstMerit 
              has adopted this Policy to inform you of the confidentiality with 
              which we treat personally identifiable financial information of 
              individual consumers (also referred to as "nonpublic personal

              We have implemented this Policy throughout the FirstMerit family

              This Policy applies to current and former customers. Our operating 
              and data processing environments are highly secure, and we maintain 
              strict physical and electronic safeguards wherever customer information 
              is used or stored. In addition, our employees are committed to maintaining 
              the confidentiality of any customer information. FirstMerit's Code 
              of Ethics requires all employees to affirmatively acknowledge that 
              all customer information is to remain confidential. We comply with 
              all applicable federal regulations in safeguarding customer information.

              recognizes the need to protect the confidentiality of the information

            <p> <b><a name="i3"></a>Your User Name and Password</b><br>
              Access to your account information via the Internet and the ability 
              to complete transactions on your account is possible only with your 
              valid user name and password combination. Your user name and password 
              should be treated with the same care and confidentiality as your 
              ATM card or debit card and PIN combination. You should avoid saving 
              your password on your computer's hard drive to prevent someone from 
              gaining access to your account via the Internet. You should also 
              use a unique user name and password for your Internet banking account. 
              Please note that FirstMerit will never ask you for your password. 
              If you ever believe your user name and password have been misused, 
              you should notify us at once by calling 1-888-554-4362, by sending 
              us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:customerservice@firstmerit.com">customerservice@firstmerit.com</a>,

              Information you provide us or that we provide you, and any instructions 
              you make to us via our Internet banking service are encrypted. This 
              means that the information shared between your browser and FirstMerit 
              is scrambled using an algorithm and then decoded once it is received 
              by us or by you using a decoder that is stored in your browser. 
              We use, and require you to use and receive, 128-bit encryption. 
              Note that e-mail communication is not encrypted in this manner. 
              Do not send confidential information or instructions to us via e-mail. 
              For more information, read the following section regarding e-mail. 
            </p><p> <b><a name="i5"></a>Cookies</b><br>
              Cookies are bits of data that many companies operating on the Internet, 
              including ours, use to identify you when you visit their Web site. 
              <br>
              FirstMerit uses cookies to make your use of our site more enjoyable 
              and efficient. Cookies consist of bits of data placed into your 
              Web browser that allow us to identify you, tailor our offerings 
              to you and speed up your experience with us whenever your log in 
              to use FirstMerit Internet banking. Cookies do not harm your hard 
              drive or your system. You can personalize your browser to refrain 
              from accepting cookies or to notify you when one will be sent. However, 
              doing so may slow down your experience with that Web site and may 
              make certain pages unavailable to you. 
            </p><p> <b><a name="i6"></a>E-mail</b><br>
              E-mail communications between you and us are not encrypted, as are 
              communications through FirstMerit's Internet banking service. For 
              that reason, you should refrain from sending us confidential information 
              via e-mail. We will likewise refrain from sending you confidential 
              information using this method. If you wish to communicate confidential 
              information to us, you can send us a secured message through the 
              Internet banking site, which will be encrypted as described in the 
              above section. 
            </p><p> <b><a name="i7"></a>Logging Out</b><br>
              It is recommended that you completely log out of the FirstMerit 
              Internet banking service and close all instances of your browser 
              when you finish transacting business with us. This will prevent 
              an unauthorized user from obtaining access to your information while 
              your connection is still open. 
            </p><p> If you do not perform any activity while you are connected to 
              the FirstMerit Internet banking service for more than 15 minutes, 
              you will be logged out automatically. 
            </p><p><b><a name="i8"></a>Firewalls</b><br>
              FirstMerit uses firewalls to protect the integrity of your information 
              and of the transactions you perform. 
            </p><p> <b><a name="i9"></a>Viruses</b><br>
              We take precautions against computer viruses by constantly scanning 
              our site for viruses. It is recommended that you use one of the 
              commercially available software applications to do the same with 
              your computer. 
            </p><p> If you would like additional information or have any questions 
              about these Principles, please contact us by calling 1-888-554-4362
