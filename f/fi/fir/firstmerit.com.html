Information is at the heart of our ability to deliver the value-added,

  Following is the Privacy Policy for the FirstMerit affiliated companies listed
  on the back, of which you are a customer, and with which you may have a relationship
  in the future. This Policy also applies to future FirstMerit affiliated companies.
  In this Policy, "we," "us," or "our" means the
  FirstMerit entity(ies) with which you have a relationship, and "you" or "your" means
  the individual customer who has the relationship. FirstMerit has adopted this
  Policy to inform you of the confidentiality with which we treat personally
  identifiable financial information of individual consumers (also referred to
  as "nonpublic personal information" or "customer information").</p>

  We have implemented this Policy throughout the FirstMerit family to ensure
  the security and accuracy of all customer information. This Policy applies
  to current and former customers. Our operating and data processing environments
  are highly secure, and we maintain strict physical and electronic safeguards
  wherever customer information is used or stored. In addition, our employees
  are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of any customer information.
  FirstMerit's Code of Ethics requires all employees to affirmatively acknowledge
  that all customer information is to remain confidential. We comply with all
  applicable federal regulations in safeguarding customer information. </p>

â€¢ Respond to your inquiries promptly, and with more complete information<br>
â€¢ Identify and recommend additional services that may save you time and
money<br>
â€¢ Tailor our products and services more closely to your financial needs<br>
â€¢ Develop new services to serve your needs even better</p>

  In order to provide you with offers of beneficial financial products and services,
  we may disclose customer information as described above in the Information
  Collection section to companies who perform joint marketing or customer services
  for us. This may include companies that perform marketing services on our behalf
  or other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.

    information disclosed to non-FirstMerit companies, you may "opt out" (that
    is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures and we will not do so)
    by calling us toll-free at 866-353-0020. Please note that if you choose to

                FirstMerit recognizes the need to protect the confidentiality of the information
                that you provide and that may be viewed via the Internet. For
                that reason<span class="bodytext">,</span> we have adopted the following Principles for Internet
                banking. </p>

  Access to your account information via the Internet and the ability to complete
  transactions on your account is possible only with your valid user name and
  password combination. Your user name and password should be treated with the
  same care and confidentiality as your ATM card or debit card and PIN combination.
  You should avoid saving your password on your computer's hard drive to prevent
  someone from gaining access to your account via the Internet. You should also
  use a unique user name and password for your Internet banking account. Please
  note that FirstMerit will never ask you for your password. If you ever believe
  your user name and password have been misused, you should notify us at once
  by calling 1-888-554-4362, by sending us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:customerservice@firstmerit.com">customerservice@firstmerit.com</a>,
