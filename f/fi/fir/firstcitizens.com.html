    policies and practices described in this notice do not apply to or protect 
    information about you that is publicly available, information about business

  <div class="content"> <span class="subhead">We Protect Information Internally.</span> 
    The only people authorized to access customer information are those who have 
    a legitimate business reason to do so in connection with their job responsibilities. 
    Our employees are bound by our Code of Ethics to access customer information 
    only for legitimate business purposes and to keep information about you confidential. 
    We emphasize this confidentiality obligation in our training and procedures

				<span class="subhead">Information Sharing.</span> 
			</div>
			
  <div class="content"> <span class="emphasize">With Related Companies to Serve 
    You Better</span>. We call the companies that are related to us by common 
    ownership or control our “affiliates.” Our affiliates are all 
    financial service providers, including banks, credit card companies, securities 
    broker-dealers and insurance companies. When we are permitted to share information 
    about you with our affiliates, we can serve you more efficiently, make it 
    easier for you to do business with us and offer you a wider variety of financial 
    products and services. For example, if you open an account with us and want 
    to open an account with our affiliate, you may not have to furnish application 
    information twice.</div>
			
  <div class="content">We are permitted by federal law to share certain types 
    of information about you with our affiliates, including identification information 
    and information about your transactions and experiences with us. In addition, 
    unless you tell us not to, we may share other information about you with our 
    affiliates that we call “eligibility information.” We use eligibility 
    information to determine your eligibility for our products and services. Eligibility 
    information may include, for example: 
    <div class="bulletedlist">
						<ul>
							<li>
          <div class="content">Information we obtain from your applications, personal 
            financial statements or other forms, such as your income, employment

				<span class="emphasize">How to Tell Us Not to Share Eligibility Information with Our Affiliates </span>
			</div>
			
  <div class="content"> If you prefer that we refrain from sharing eligibility 
    information about you with our affiliates, you may direct us not to by calling 
    us toll free at 1.877.654.2320 or by writing to us at: Compliance Department-RWN21, 
    P.O. Box 27131, Raleigh, NC 27611-7131. When two or more customers jointly 
    obtain a financial product or service from us, we will treat a request not 
    to share eligibility information made by one of the joint customers as applying 
    only to that person unless that customer tells us that he or she is acting 
    on behalf of other joint customers. We will process your request as quickly 
    as we reasonably can. </div>
			
			<div class="content">
				
    <div class="detailindent"> <span class="emphasize">Note: We are required by 
      law to send a summary of our consumer privacy policies and practices to 
      you each year for as long as you remain our customer. If you tell us not 
      to share eligibility information about you with our affiliates, we will 
      honor your instructions until we receive instructions from you to the contrary. 
      You do not need to notify us each time you receive a copy of our privacy 
      notice.</span> </div>

  <div class="content"> <span class="emphasize">With Companies that Work with 
    Us to Serve You Better.</span> We may use outside companies to assist us in 
    processing your transactions, maintaining and servicing your accounts and 
    insurance products and in the day-to-day conduct of our business. For example, 
    other companies perform specialized support services for us when they imprint 
    checks, provide data processing support, process payments or assist us in 
    our marketing efforts. In addition, we may enter into joint marketing agreements 
    with other financial institutions to offer you a wider variety of financial 
    products and services. We may disclose any of the information we collect to 
    companies that perform services (including marketing services) for us and 
    to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements. 
    However, when we do so, the company’s right to use and redisclose the 
    information we provide is limited by law or contract. </div>
			
			
  <div class="content"> <span class="emphasize">In Other Situations.</span> We 
    do not otherwise disclose information about you without your consent except 
    as required or permitted by law. For example, we are permitted or required 
    to disclose information about you to process your transactions and maintain 
    and service your accounts with us and the insurance products you purchase 
    from or through us, to report our experiences with you to credit bureaus in 
    accordance with well-established banking practices and the federal Fair Credit 
    Reporting Act, to protect against fraud or loss, or to respond to a subpoena 
    or court order. </div>

    with insurance transactions to process, underwrite and administer insurance 
    applications, products, accounts and claims, and for other permissible business 
    purposes. We do not share this insurance information or any classification 
    based on this information with our affiliates or others except as required

    personal information from persons other than those proposed for coverage. 
    You have certain rights to access and make corrections to personal information 
    we gather about you in connection with insurance transactions. In certain 
    circumstances required or permitted by law, we may disclose personal insurance 
    information without your authorization. We will provide you at your request

    your right to access and correct insurance information. </div>
