				 who obtain financial products or services from us primarily for personal, family or 
				 household purposes. They apply with equal force to both current and former customers. 
				 When we use the term "information" in this notice, we mean information about you 
				 that is not publicly available. The policies and practices described in this notice 
				 do not apply to or protect information about you that is publicly available, 
				 information about business entities or information about individuals who obtain 
				 financial products or services for business, commercial or agricultural purposes. 
				 We have included examples in this notice of information we collect, how we use it, 
				 with whom we share it and what we do to protect it. The examples we use are for the 
				 purpose of illustration only—you should not consider them to be a comprehensive 
				 description of our privacy practices. This notice does not apply to your 
				 relationships with other financial service providers (such as other banks, mortgage

				 Their privacy policies will govern how they collect, use and disclose personal

					We use information about you, for example, to process your applications, administer your accounts and insurance products, process your transactions, serve your financial needs, determine your eligibility for products and services we offer and provide you with information about products, services and other opportunities that may interest you.

			<div class="content">
				<span class="subhead">We Protect Information Internally.</span> 
				The only people authorized to access customer information are those who have a legitimate business reason to do so in connection with their job responsibilities.

We emphasize this confidentiality obligation in our training and procedures and maintain appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce our employees' privacy responsibilities.

Our affiliates are all financial service providers, including banks, credit card companies, securities broker-dealers and insurance companies. When we are permitted to share information about you with our affiliates, we can serve you more efficiently, make it easier for you to do business with us and offer you a wider variety of financial products and services. For example, if you open an account with us and want to open an account with our affiliate, you may not have to furnish application information twice.

				We are permitted by federal law to share certain types of information about you with our affiliates, including identification information and information about your transactions and experiences with us. In addition, unless you tell us not to, we may share other information about you with our affiliates that we call "eligibility information." We use eligibility information to determine your eligibility for our products and services. Eligibility information may include, for example:
				<div class="bulletedlist">
						<ul>
							<li><div class="content">Information we obtain from your applications, personal financial statements or other forms, such as your income, employment and marital status;</div></li>
							<li><div class="content">Information we obtain from a consumer report or a credit bureau, such as your credit history or your credit score;</div></li>
							<li><div class="content">Information we obtain to verify your representations to us, such as open lines of credit you may have with others; and</div></li>
							<li><div class="content">Information we obtain from others regarding employment, credit or other relationships you may have with them, such as your employment history.</div></li>
						</ul>

				<span class="emphasize">How to Tell Us Not to Share Eligibility Information with Our Affiliates </span>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				If you prefer that we refrain from sharing eligibility information about you with our affiliates, you may direct us not to by calling us toll free at 877-654-2320 or by writing to us at: Compliance Department-RWN21, P.O. Box 27131, Raleigh, NC 27611-7131. When two or more customers jointly obtain a financial product or service from us, we will treat a request not to share eligibility information made by one of the joint customers as applying only to that person unless that customer tells us that he or she is acting on behalf of other joint customers. We will process your request as quickly as we reasonably can.

				We may use outside companies to assist us in processing your transactions, maintaining and servicing your accounts and insurance products and in the day-to-day conduct of our business. For example, other companies perform specialized support services for us when they imprint checks, provide data processing support, process payments or assist us in our marketing efforts. In addition, we may enter into joint marketing agreements with other financial institutions to offer you a wider variety of financial products and services. We may disclose any of the information we collect to companies that perform services (including marketing services) for us and to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements. However, when we do so, the company's right to use and redisclose the information we provide is limited by law or contract.
