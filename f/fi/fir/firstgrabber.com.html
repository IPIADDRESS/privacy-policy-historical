	<h3>How we collect your personal information</h3>
	<p><strong>About Cookies</strong><br>Cookies are small pieces of information that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer through your web browser. It will store and sometimes track information about your using experience. </p>
	<p>Firstgrabber uses cookies to recognize you as a repeat visitor, to understand and save your preferences for providing customized services and aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction. When you enter our Website, our web server sends a cookie to your computer or device which allows us to recognize your browser or device. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but you can change the preference on your browser settings to notify you whenever a cookie is set or turn it off. Please note that blocking cookies may cause some of our Services to function improperly.</p>

	<h3>What's Private</h3>
	<p>The following information will not be publicly viewable:<br>
	- any payment information you provide<br>
	- your password details<br>
	- your IP address<br>
	- any shipping information (including your address and your phone number)<br>
	- e-mails you send to us </p>


	<p>We will not give your personal information to any third-party services, except when it's necessary to provide our Service (like when we partner with payment processors and delivery). <br>We do reserve the right to disclose personal information when we believe that is reasonably necessary as required by law, to prevent fraud or abuse, or to protect your safety and Firstgrabber's legal rights.</p>

	<h3>What's Only Share with the Manufacturers</h3>
	<p>We do not exchange, rent or sell your Personal Information to third parties for marketing, advertising or other uses. However, we will share your personal information with manufacturers only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. </p>
	<p>We may share your name, email, telephone numbers and shipping address with the manufacturers for delivery and offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to you and are obligated to keep your information confidential.  </p>

	<h3>What's Public</h3>
	<p>When you register on Firstgrabber, our system will create a basic profile page for you, containing your account name, a list of products you have pre-ordered, and your reviews. Whenever your account name appears on the site (for instance, when you post comments or pre-order an item), people can click your account name to see your profile. The profile is not searchable on Firstgrabber or via search engines like Google. Here are some of the things that will be publicly displayed on your profile, or elsewhere on the site:<br>
	- the account name<br>
	- the day you joined Firstgrabber<br>
	- your referral rank, trophies and badges<br>
	- any information you choose to add to your profile (like a picture or your location)<br>
	- products you've pre-ordered
	</p>
	<p>The profile you create on our site will be publicly visible. You may change the visibility settings of your pre-order history on your account settings page.</p>
	<p>Please note that each product page lists the name of the first pre-order and the most current pre-order. When you've successfully referred a friend to pre-order a product, your name will be on their pre-order list page. When you are referred by someone, your name will be on their list of referrals page. </p>
	<p>We may display users' comments posted on our site in newsletters or related emails.</p>

	<h3>How We Use Your Personal Information</h3>
	<p>We use your Personal Information to maintain, improve and customize our Service and conduct our business. For example (and not limited to):<br>
	- Register as a member and to identify you when you sign-in to your account<br>
	- Administer your account and your pre-orders<br>
	- Analyze the use of the Service and conduct research to improve our and Services and product selection<br>
	- Present products to you which we believe will meet your interest based on your geographic location and usage patterns<br>
	- To process transactions and fulfill your orders<br>
	- Notify you of your registration and order processing<br>
	- Send you weekly newsletters, monthly news, pre-order updates or other promotional communications<br>
	- Enable us to contact you to respond to your inquiries, customer service requests, complaints etc.</p>

	<h3>How We Store and Protect Your Personal Information</h3>
	<p>We take your online security seriously and we implement the latest encryption technology to maintain the safety of your Personal Information whenever you submit information and pre-orders.</p>
	<p>All sensitive personal information (including your e-mail, password and credit information) will be encrypted via Security Sockets Layer (SSL) technology into our payment gateway providers database. Such systems cannot be accessible without special access rights. After the transaction, your payment information will not be stored on our servers or database.</p>
	<p>To protect the personal information submitted to us, we follow generally accepted standards and our servers and website security are scanned and fully verified by McAfee Secure from Symantec on a daily basis. And all employees that we hired have to sign a confidentiality agreement that forbids them from disclosing any information to other individuals or entities. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p>

	<h3>Notification and Opt-Out</h3>
	<p>Sending Service-related notices via your e-mail address will be set as default. You may not opt out of some Service-related communications such as notifications of pre-order processing or any notices required by law.</p>
	<p>You may opt-out to receive periodic e-mails from us, including weekly newsletter, monthly news, update of certain products and other promotion messages under your account settings page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving latest news of great products, improvements of our Services, or other special offers.</p>

	<h3>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>
	<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to improve our Services. We will post a notice of those changes on this page with modification date, and/or notify you by email to keep you aware of the latest changes about the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information, prior to the change becoming effective. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Therefore, we suggest you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our Privacy Policy.</p>
