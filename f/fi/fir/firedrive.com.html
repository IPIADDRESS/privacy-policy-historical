<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Your privacy is important to Firedrive Media Limited (“Firedrive”), so we have developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect our ongoing commitment to the development of new products and services, as well as changes to applicable laws and regulations. Please take time to review our Privacy Policy below and understand how our policies affect you, your personal information and your content.</p>
</div>
<div class="p_container">
<h1>Collection of Personal Information</h1>
<p>Firedrive collects personally identifiable information such as your name, name of your business, e-mail address, web site address or URL, home or work address and telephone number.

As well, Firedrive will also collect financial information including credit card information, email address, billing address, purchases details. Firedrive will submit the information that pertains to payment processing to our payment-processing partners via encrypted communication for verification.

Our payment processing partner does not share or sell this information.&nbsp; It is your responsibility to review the Privacy Policy of our payment-processing partner to understand how your personal information is collected and use. <br>
From time to time, Firedrive may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.
