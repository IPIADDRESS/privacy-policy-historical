              <p>This site is  owned and operated by Red Frog Events, LLC ("RFE"). &nbsp;Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. &nbsp;We want to make your  experience online satisfying and safe.</p>
              <p>Because we  gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully  understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and  use of that information.&nbsp; This privacy  statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.</p>
              <h2>INFORMATION RFE  GATHERS AND TRACKS</h2>
              <p>RFE gathers two  types of information about users:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Information that users provide through  optional, voluntary submissions. &nbsp;These  are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate  in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in  polls and surveys.</li>
                <li>Information RFE gathers through aggregated  tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our  sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers’  needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the  demographics of our audience. Under no circumstances does RFE sell any  information about an individual user to a third party.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>RFE Gathers  User Information In The Following Processes:</p>
              <p>Optional  Voluntary Information</p>
              <p>We offer the  following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of  personal information by users:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Electronic newsletters policy<br>
              We will offer a  free electronic newsletter to users.&nbsp; RFE  gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe.&nbsp; Users may remove themselves from this mailing  list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the  subscription management page.&nbsp; Users can  also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration.</li>
              <li>Message boards/forums policy<br>
              Users of any of  the site’s forums must register separately for these services (both are free of  charge) in order to post messages, although they need not register to visit the  site.&nbsp; During registration the user is  required to supply a username, password and email address.</li>
              <li>Tell A Friend Policy<br>
              Our site users  can choose to electronically forward a link, page or documents to someone else  by clicking “Tell A Friend.”&nbsp; The user  must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient.&nbsp; This information is used only in the case of  transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the  email. &nbsp;The information is not used for  any other purpose.</li>
              <li>Polling<br>
              RFE may offer  interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other  users and see what our audience thinks about important issues.&nbsp; Opinions or other responses to polls are  aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user.</li>
              <li>Surveys<br>
              RFE may  occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our  audience.&nbsp; We sometimes share the  aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors,  advertisers and partners.&nbsp; We never share  any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.</li>
              <li>Children<br>
              Consistent with  the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will  never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under  the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.</li>
              <li>Usage tracking<br>
              RFE tracks user  traffic patterns throughout our site.&nbsp; However,  we do not correlate this information with data about individual users.&nbsp; RFE does break down overall usage statistics  according to a user’s domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this  information from the browser string (information contained in every user’s  browser).<br>
              RFE uses  tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't  like based on traffic to those areas.&nbsp; We  do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs  overall.&nbsp; This helps us continue to build  a better service for you.</li>
              <li>Cookies<br>
              We may place a  text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer.&nbsp; The cookie itself does not contain Personal  Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to  information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. &nbsp;The only personal information a cookie can  contain is information you supply yourself. &nbsp;A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk  or read cookie files created by other sites. &nbsp;RFE uses cookies to track user traffic  patterns (as described above).<br>
              You can refuse  cookies by turning them off in your browser. &nbsp;If you’ve set your browser to warn you before  accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. &nbsp;You do not need to have cookies turned on to  use this site.&nbsp; However, you do need  cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, polling and surveys.</li>
              </ol>
              <p><em>Privacy Policy  Use</em></p>
              <p>How the  information you gather is used if relevant.</p>
              <h2>USE OF  INFORMATION</h2>
              <p>RFE uses any  information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience on our  website, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites  or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.</p>
              <p>As stated  above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out  electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys,  message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular  schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special  editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in  something we are doing.&nbsp; RFE never shares  newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers,  sponsors or partners.</p>
              <h2>OPT-OUT POLICY</h2>
              <p>RFE gives users  options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Opting not to register to receive our  electronic newsletters.</li>
                <li>Opting not to participate in certain  interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need to gather any  personally identifiable information from our users</li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h2>YOUR CONSENT</h2>
              <p>By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this  information by RFE. &nbsp;If we decide to  change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you  are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what  circumstances we disclose it.</p>
