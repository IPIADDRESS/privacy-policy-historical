  Privacy Principles</p>
<p class="regText"> As a world leader in electronic commerce and payment services, 
  FDMS processes the information that enables businesses and consumers to pay 
  for goods and services by credit, debit or stored-value cards at the point of 
  sale. </p>
<p class="regText">FDMS works behind the scenes on behalf of its alliances, banks, 
  other card acquirers and merchants. As the internet continues to play a greater 
  role in commerce and payments, FDMS will continue to develop solutions that 
  enable businesses and consumers to pay anyone, anywhere, anytime. </p>
<p class="regText">Millions of consumers and businesses rely on FDMS, and our 
  client partners, for safe and reliable payment services. Our relationships are 
  established based on mutual trust. Each day, we - and our more than 9,000 employees 
  - strive to reinforce our commitment to our business customers and consumers. 
</p>
<p class="regText">In order to provide these services, FDMS must collect, maintain 
  and use financial and other sensitive personal information. </p>
<p class="regText"> FDMS' Privacy Principles guide us in the collection and use 
  of information and reinforce the role our employees play in protecting consumer 
  privacy. </p>
<p class="regText">Our business customers and alliances may adopt other principles 
  applicable to their collection and use of information or simply customize these 
  principles.</p>
<p class="regText"><b><i>FDMS Privacy Principles</i></b></p>
<ol>
  <li class="regText"><b class="regText"> <u>WE OBTAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT 
    IS NEEDED TO PROVIDE OUR GOODS AND SERVICES.</u> </b></li>
</ol>
<p class="regText">We primarily receive personal information as a result of consumers' 
  financial transactions with FDMS<span class="super">SM</span> or with FDMS business 
  customers and alliances. Generally, FDMS does not obtain personal information 
  directly from consumers. However, when FDMS collects information directly from 
  consumers, we obtain the personal information that is needed to provide our 
  goods or services, to provide customer service and to fulfill any legal or regulatory 
  requirements. When we obtain information about consumers from third parties, 
  we use reputable sources, including public repositories.</p>
<ol start="2">
  <li class="regText"><b><u>WE WILL INFORM CONSUMERS ABOUT THE GENERAL USES OF 
    THEIR INFORMATION.</u> </b></li>
</ol>
<p class="regText">Generally, FDMS does not have a direct customer relationship 
  with consumers. However, when we have a direct relationship with consumers, 
  we will strive to make information available to them about the general uses 
  of the information that we collect. Generally, FDMS obtains personal information 
  about consumers indirectly through our business customers and channels. To that 
  end, we encourage our business customers and channels to provide these consumers 
  with a timely and complete privacy notice. </p>
<ol start="3">
  <li class="regText"><b><u>WE USE CONSUMER INFORMATION IN A MANNER WHICH IS CONSISTENT 
    WITH OUR PRIVACY NOTICE.</u></b></li>
</ol>
<p class="regText">FDMS uses information only in a manner consistent with our 
  privacy notice. Protecting consumer privacy is very important as we build trusted 
  relationships and assist businesses and consumers in conducting sensitive and 
  wide-ranging electronic commerce activities. </p>
<ol start="4">
  <li class="regText"><b><u>WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY 
    OF PERSONAL CONSUMER INFORMATION.</u></b></li>
</ol>
<p class="regText">Within FDMS, access to personal information is limited to those 
  employees of FDMS and its affiliates who need it to fulfill their business responsibilities. 
</p>
<p class="regText">When FDMS collects information on behalf of our business customers 
  and alliances, we handle the information based on their direction and in accordance 
  with our agreements and contracts with them and applicable laws.</p>
<p class="regText">Vendors and other outside contractors we engage are subject 
  to our contractual requirements to ensure sensitive personal information is 
  safeguarded. </p>
<ol start="5">
  <li class="regText"><b><u>WE STRIVE TO GIVE CONSUMERS CHOICES ABOUT HOW THEIR 
    DATA WILL BE USED.</u></b></li>
</ol>
<p class="regText">If we obtain personal information as part of our direct relationship 
  with consumers, we will not share this information with non-affiliated third 
  parties except in accordance with these Privacy Principles; to facilitate and 
  complete consumer-initiated or authorized transactions; to comply with federal, 
  state and local laws, including credit reporting laws and card association rules; 
  to combat fraud; or to offer products and services that FDMS believes may be 
  of interest to its customers. Upon request, we will allow consumers to remove 
  their names from any FDMS-owned marketing lists.</p>
<ol start="6">
  <li class="regText"><b><u>WE USE APPROPRIATE SECURITY SAFEGUARDS.</u></b></li>
</ol>
<p class="regText">At FDMS, security is a priority. We employ appropriate measures 
  to protect consumer information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration 
  or destruction. These may include, among others, encryption, physical access 
  security and other appropriate technologies. FDMS continually reviews and enhances 
  its security systems, as necessary.</p>
<ol start="7">

    WE COLLECT AND WHERE APPLICABLE, WE WILL INFORM CONSUMERS ABOUT HOW THEY CAN 
    ACCESS THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND MAKE CORRECTIONS, IF NECESSARY.</u></b></li>
</ol>
<p class="regText">Generally, FDMS does not collect personal information directly 
  from consumers. However, where information is collected by FDMS directly from 
  consumers, we permit them to review and, if possible, dispute or correct any 
  erroneous or out-of-date information stored in our database, which is retrievable 
  on a personally identifiable basis. (Of course, this review and correction would 
  not be possible if the information is proprietary to one of our business customers 
  or if access would violate the privacy or legal rights of a third party).</p>
<ol start="8">
  <li class="regText"><b><u>WE HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE TO OUR PRIVACY PRINCIPLES.</u></b></li>
</ol>
<p class="regText">FDMS is committed to meeting the highest standards for our
