<strong>Information We Disclose</strong>. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law.

</p><p>
<span class="style1">Third Parties</span>. Many times it is necessary to utilize other companies that provide services necessary to your banking relationship with First Interstate Bank. We are permitted under law to disclose nonpublic personal information about you to “nonaffiliated third parties,” that is, third parties that are not members of our corporate family, in certain circumstances. These companies act on our behalf when they provide services and are not authorized to use the information for any other purposes. For example, we may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to third parties that provide data processing services, print your checks, provide credit insurance products or provide technical assistance with our software programs. We may provide your name and address to companies that mail information to you about our own products and services. We do not share medical information that we may obtain in insurance applications or claims to anyone, except for the purposes you have authorized.

</p><ul><li>
When you authorize us to release information;
</li><li>To consumer reporting agencies;
</li><li>To comply with a law, regulation, court order or subpoena;
</li><li>To verify the existence of your account and general information about the condition of your account for a merchant or other financial institution;
</li><li>In response to an inquiry about whether a check you have written on an account will clear;
</li><li>To local, state and federal authorities if we believe a crime may have been committed involving your account;
</li><li>To our independent auditors, consultants or attorneys and to agencies that regulate us.

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.
