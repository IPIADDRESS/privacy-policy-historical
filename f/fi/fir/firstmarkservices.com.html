		We at Firstmark Services are committed to providing you a useful and enjoyable 
		online experience, and to protecting your personal information during your 
		visit. When you access a Firstmark Services web site, you can be sure that your 
		information is protected by the latest security and authentication techniques. 
		We may collect information from your visit, in order to personalize and improve 
		upon your experience with us, but all information we collect is treated as 
		confidential. To access student loan account information and send emails via 
		our web site, you will need a browser that supports the use of Secure Sockets 
		Layer (IE 8.0 or higher or Chrome). This 	encryption technology helps ensure the 
		authenticity of your online sessions and secures data being transmitted over the 
		public Internet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Internet Explorer displays a lock icon in a locked 
		position on the status bar when you enter a secure site. When you leave a 
		secure web site, Internet Explorer displays a lock icon in an unlocked position 
		on the status bar. If the page you are viewing uses frames, you may not see the 
		key or lock, but can simply right-click anywhere in the frame and select 
		"Properties". If the web site address (URL) starts with "https" the "s" 
		indicates a secure site or area of the site.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you enter a Firstmark Services web site, you will pass through our 
		security "firewall" and we identify the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your 
		computer or handheld device. The IP address won't identify you personally, but 
		it will let us identify the device you're using and we store IP addresses in 
		case we need to track a connection for security purposes.

	<p>
		Firstmark Services web sites use cookies in several applications for 
		navigational purposes. A cookie is a small text file placed on your hard drive 
		(with your permission) by a web page server. Accepting a cookie from a 
		Firstmark Services web site does not give Firstmark Services access to your 
		computer or any personal information about you. Also, the type of cookies we 
		use don't get stored permanently in your computer - they expire immediately 
		after you close your browser and are deleted. You can also set up your web 
		browser to inform you when cookies are set or to prevent cookies from being 
		set.
	</p>
	<p>
		Firstmark Services websites do not respond to a do-not-track setting or other 
		mechanisms that provide the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection
		of personally identifiable information of your online activities over time and 
		across third-party websites or online services.
	</p>
	<p>
		We don't knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information from our web 
		sites about children under age 13. If we find out we have collected such 
		information we will take all reasonable measures to delete that information 
		from our system as soon as possible. We are not responsible for the collection 
		and use of information by companies or individuals unaffiliated with us whose 
		web sites may contain links to ours.

		We collect information so we can identify you as our customer, to establish, 
		manage and protect your accounts, to complete your transactions, to create and 
		offer you products and services you might be interested in, and to comply with 
		various legal and regulatory requirements.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a id="Collect"><em>What We Collect</em></a><br>
		We may collect "nonpublic personal information" about you from the following 
		sources:
	</p>
	<p>
		* Information from your loan applications or other loan and account forms.<br>
		* Information about your transactions with us or others; and<br>
		* Information we receive from third parties, such as credit bureaus.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Nonpublic personal information" is nonpublic information about you that we 
		obtain in connection with providing a financial product or service to you. For 
		example, nonpublic personal information includes information regarding your 
		account balance, payment history, and overdraft history, if applicable.

	<p>
		<a id="Share"><em>What We Share</em></a><br>
		We are permitted under law to disclose nonpublic personal information about you 
		to other third parties in certain circumstances. For example, we may disclose 
		nonpublic personal information about you to third parties to assist us in 
		servicing your loan or account with us, to government entities in response to 
		subpoenas, and to credit bureaus. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal 
		information about you except as permitted by law.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you pay your loan in full or become an inactive customer, we will continue 
		to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice.
	</p>
	<p>
		VERMONT RESIDENTS: We will not disclose nonpublic personal financial 
		information about you other than as permitted by law unless you authorize us to 
		make that disclosure. Your authorization must be in writing or, if you agree, 
		in electronic form. If you wish to authorize us to disclose your nonpublic

	</p>
	<p>

		Sometimes the law or other circumstances also require that we disclose 
		nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties. Some 
		examples are: when you ask or permit us to do so; when a guaranty agency, 
		school or the Department of Education need that information in connection with 
		your account, with agencies that assist us in servicing your loan; in response 
		to subpoenas or court orders; with credit bureaus; or when we suspect fraud or 
		criminal activity.
	</p>
	<p>
		We do not collect or share personally identifiable information about your online
		activities over time and across different websites.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a id="Security"><em>Our Security Procedures</em></a><br>

		restrict access to your personal and account information to those employees who 
		need to know that information to provide products or services to you, and we 
		regularly train our employees on privacy, information security, and their 
		obligation to protect your information. We maintain physical, electronic, and 
		procedural safeguards that comply with federal and industry standards to guard 
		your personal information and we regularly test those safeguards to maintain 
		the appropriate levels of protection.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our Information Security divisions continually update and improve the security 
		standards and procedures we use to help protect against anyone gaining 
		unauthorized access to your confidential information, including through 
		the Internet. We also build checks and balances into our procedures so that we 
		can properly identify our customers.
	</p>

		precautions. Protect your account numbers, passwords, PIN's, and customer 
		access numbers. Never disclose confidential information to unknown callers. 
		You should always use a secure browser and current virus detection software, 
		and never open e-mail from unknown sources.
