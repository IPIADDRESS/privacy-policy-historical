<p>We receive information about you from various sources, including via your use of the Sites and via your use of various third party websites and social media. When you visit the Sites, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy, and are expressly consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Your continued use of the Sites after our update constitutes your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in our <a href="http://www.complex.com/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of your personally identifiable information (“<strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>”), which is information that we can use to identify you as an individual.&nbsp; Personally Identifiable Information includes information such as your name, username, password, age, email address, and other information that we associated with Personally Identifiable Information.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personally Identifiable Information that our business partners share with us or we share with our business partners.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy does not cover the activities of third parties that we do not own or control but that may be linked to or accessible via our Sites (“<strong>Third Party Services</strong>”).&nbsp; Some examples of Third Party Services are when you log into Facebook, Google+ and Twitter while using or visiting the Sites. Third Party Services will have their own privacy policies that govern your use of their sites, services, or applications.&nbsp; We are not responsible for your use of Third Party Services, or for the content or policies of Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the policies of any Third Party Services you access.</p>
