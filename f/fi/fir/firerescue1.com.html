<tr>
<td class="mid"><p>FireRescue1 collects information in several ways  from different parts of our network of web sites.</p>
  <p>Some personal information is gathered when you  register. During registration, FireRescue1 asks all users for your name, email  address, city, occupation, department information, industry and personal  interests.&nbsp; Once you register you are no  longer anonymous to FireRescue1 - you will select an appropriate FireRescue1  username and then given access to FireRescue1's many offerings.</p>
  <p>In addition to registration we may ask you for  personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you  enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by FireRescue1 and/or our  many partners; when you post a FireRescue1 Classified ad; when you submit a  listing for a web site; and when you report a problem with one of our sites or  services. If you contact FireRescue1 we may keep a record of that  correspondence. FireRescue1 also occasionally asks users to complete surveys  that we use for research purposes. Wherever FireRescue1 collects personal  information we include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.</p></td></tr>

<td class="mid"><strong>What are cookies and how does FireRescue1 use them?</strong></td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="mid"><p>As part of offering and providing customizable  and personalized services, FireRescue1 uses cookies to store and sometimes  track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to  your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All  sites on FireRescue1 where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable  require that you accept</p>
  <p>Generally, we use cookies to:</p>
  <p>1. Remind us of whom you are and to access your  account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a  better and more personalized service. This cookie passes your username and  password when you register or "Sign In" and is modified when you  "Sign Out" of our services. Other submitted personal information such  as occupation and city are not linked to cookies.</p>
  <p>2. Estimate our audience size. Each browser  accessing FireRescue1 is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine  the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an  unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests  and behavior.</p>
  <p>3. Track your progress and number of entries in  some of our promotions, sweepstakes and contests. When a FireRescue1-hosted  promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates the  player's progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries,  submissions, and status in prize drawings.</p>
  <p>4. Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas  of FireRescue1's network of web sites you have visited, and your visiting  patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users'  habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new  experience on FireRescue1 a better one. We may use this information to better  personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will  see on our sites.</p>
  <p>Advertising networks that serve ads onto  FireRescue1 may also use their own cookies.&nbsp;  Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our  site.&nbsp; We have no access to or control  over these cookies.&nbsp; This privacy  statement covers the use of cookies by FireRescue1.com only and does not cover  the use of cookies by any of our advertisers.</p>
  <p>FireRescue1 also collects IP addresses for system  administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. In  addition, FireRescue1 Mail includes IP addresses in outgoing mail message  headers. </p>
  Our tracking technology used to for client campaigns  throughout the site does not collect any personal identifiable information that  you provide as apart of your FireRescue1 membership.&nbsp; Your personal information stored in cookies  is only used for the purposes listed above to help improve your user experience.</td>

<td class="mid"><strong>How does FireRescue1 use my information?</strong></td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="mid"><p>FireRescue1's primary goal in collecting personal  information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our  network of sites. This includes personalization services, interactive  communications, online shopping and many other types of services, most of which  are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we  display advertisements. By knowing a little about you, FireRescue1 is able to  deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to  you.</p>
  <p>In our role of delivering targeted  advertisements, FireRescue1 plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an  advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example,  Firemen from North East US cities). FireRescue1 takes the advertisement and  displays it to users meeting that criteria. In this process, the advertiser  never has access to individual account information. Only FireRescue1 has access  to individuals' accounts. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner  ads as well as promotional email through FireRescue1 Delivers. You will not  receive special offers via email from FireRescue1 if you indicate to us that  you would not like to receive them. You can change these account preferences at  any time.</p>
  <p>FireRescue1 does research on our users'  demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us  upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from  surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is  compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. FireRescue1 may share this  aggregated data with advertisers or business partners.</p></td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="mid"><strong>Who is collecting information?</strong></td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="mid"><p>When you are on a FireRescue1 site and are asked  for personal information, you are sharing that information with FireRescue1  alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. For example, some  FireRescue1 services, like FlashoverTV, are offered as a brand of FireRescue1  using the same infrastructure and member database.&nbsp; This information is stored within a cookie  during login and not otherwise collected by a partner company for any  purpose.&nbsp; If data is being collected  and/or maintained by any company other than FireRescue1, you will be notified  prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your  data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that  particular service.&nbsp; If you have any  questions about the use of your information by co-branded sites or experience  login problems on a co-branded site please visit the <a href="http://www.firerescue1.com/CustomerSupport/TechnicalHelp/">technical  support section</a>.</p>
  <p>Promotions that run on FireRescue1 may be  sponsored by companies other than FireRescue1 or may be cosponsored by  FireRescue1 and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion  may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified  prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to  participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared.</p>

<tr>
<td class="mid"><p>As a general rule, FireRescue1 will not disclose  any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your  permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good  faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below.  Please see the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for each of our products and  services for more detailed information about how your personal information may  be shared. The following describes some of the ways that your information may  be disclosed.</p>
  <p>Business Partners &amp; Sponsors: FireRescue1 may  disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this  is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to  transferring the data. Details of shared use can be found in specific Terms of  Service or Use Agreements, and sweepstakes and promotions rules. Some or all  data collected during a FireRescue1 promotion may be shared with a sponsor. If  personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will tell you before  we collect or transfer the data.</p>
  <p>Many promotions offer opportunities to request  additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give  FireRescue1 permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so  they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will  be shared. If more information will be shared with the sponsor, you will be  notified prior to the transfer.</p>
  <p>Merchants listed on FireRescue1 have separate  privacy and data collection practices. FireRescue1 has no responsibility or  liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding the  merchant, their store, and their privacy policies, return to that store's home  page and click on their Information link.</p>
  <p>From time to time, you may be offered the  opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If you  opt-in to receive information from these third parties, FireRescue1 will (with  your permission) share your name and email address with them.</p>
  Third Party Data &amp; Data in the Aggregate: Under  confidentiality agreements, FireRescue1 may match user information with third  party data. Also, FireRescue1 discloses aggregated user statistics (for  example, 75% of our users are male and are interested in firefighting) in order  to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third  parties, and for other lawful purposes.</td>
