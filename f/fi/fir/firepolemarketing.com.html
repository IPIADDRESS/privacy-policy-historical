				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				
				
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects information from all end users of our Internet services (the "Services") - those who access some of our services but do not have accounts ("visitors") as well as those who may purchase products and/or pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the service ("members")- what we do with the information we collect, and the choices visitors and members have concerning the collection and use of such information. We request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3rd Party Disclosure - Customer information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without the consent of the customer, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product or service requested by the customer.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Private Information Security - For your safety and protection, your credit card information is not stored on our servers. Our payment gateway provider, PayPal, keeps this information encrypted and secure on your behalf.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you decide to opt-in to our mailing list, you will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, promotions, etc. However, you may opt-out at any time by clicking the unsubscribe button at the bottom of your emails.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Introduction. Our company collects information in different ways from visitors and members who access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites accessible through our service.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Registration: Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Products or Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the services. The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes). This information may be shared with third parties, as stated herein, or in special circumstances.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our Services, we may provide the partner certain information, such as the name, address, and username of the persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the purpose of offering you other products and goods.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also, with purchases, we supply our member's contact information, to our business partners, who then may contact the member by telephone after the member purchase. Sales proceeds are collected by the that business partner company. We also may supply other companies with contact information, for mail offers we believe would be of interest to our members, with or without compensation from those companies. At times we may send an advertisement for a third party product, where we collect the sales proceeds, and forward the purchaser's information to that third party.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our Company Partners and Sponsors: Some products and services may be offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members some of there products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal information.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Online Shopping: At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new product and service updates. In many cases you may be asked to provide contact information such as your name, address, phone number, and credit/debit card information.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the recipients name, address, and phone number. Our company has no control over the third parties' use of any personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In you order services or products directly from our company, we use the personal information you provide to process that order. We do not share this information with outside parties that we do business with.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Online Advertisements: Our company may display our online advertisements. In those cases we share information about our Visitors and Members through the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Additionally, in some instances, we use this information to deliver tailored advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us the audience they want to reach and us and advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the information we have collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to the intended audience. Our company does not share personal information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers or joint venture companies.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to our company, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Voluntary Customer Surveys: We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us improve the types of products and services we offer and how we provide them to you.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Special Cases: It is our company's policy to use or share the personal information about Visitors or Members in ways described herein without additional notice or means to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</font>
</p><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your use of the services or Websites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole desecration, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: credit agencies, collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service, or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect our company and our members.</font>
