	<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
	<div align="left"><font size="2">We recognize 
	the sensitive nature of your personal financial information and take precautions 
	to protect your privacy. When you entrust us with your financial information, 
	you can be certain it will be used within our guidelines. <br><br>We are 
	committed to your right to have your personal financial information remain 
	private and secure. While information is the cornerstone of our ability to 
	provide superior service, our most important asset is our customer trust. 
	Therefore, we have adopted this Privacy Policy.<br><br>We have prepared this 
	Policy to explain what types of information we collect, how we use it, and under 
	what circumstances we may share it. We want you to know that we use information 
	we know about you responsibly to: </font></div>
	<ul>
	<li>
	<div align="left"><font size="2">provide you 
	with the services you have requested. </font></div>
	</li><li>
	<div align="left"><font size="2">offer you other 
	bank products and services. </font></div>
	</li><li>
	<div align="left"><font size="2">alert you to 
	financial products and services made available by our carefully selected 
	marketing partners.</font></div></li></ul>
	<div align="left">
	<p><font size="2">This Policy covers Customer 
	Information, which means personally identifiable information about a consumer or 
	a consumer's current or former relationship with us. <br><br><b>You do not have 
	to take any action to prevent us from selling your information because we do not 
	sell customer information to any third parties. </b><br><br><b>Collection and 
	Use</b><br>We limit the personal information about you which we collect and use 
	to that which is necessary to provide superior customer service, maintain and 
	administer your account, and to provide financial services that are of interest 
	to you. Generally, the information we gather about customers is provided 
	directly by you. We develop additional information as part of providing a 
	service and gather information from outside sources such as public records, 
	market research and credit reports. We use that information only in accordance 
	with the principles set out in this Policy.<br><br><b>Accuracy</b><br>We 
	continually strive to ensure that the information we maintain about you is 
	complete and accurate. You have the right to notify us if you believe we have 
	reported inaccurate information about you or your account to any consumer 
	reporting agency. Notices should be sent in writing and include your complete 
	name, current address, Social Security Number, telephone number, account number, 
	type of account, specific item in dispute and the reason why you believe the 
	information reported is in error. Send your notice to:</font></p>
	<p></p></div>
	<div align="left"><font size="2">We will 
	investigate your concerns and correct any inaccuracies and confirm our actions 
	to you. <br><br><b>Confidentiality and Security</b> <br>We will allow employees 
	to access information about you when that access is necessary to maintain your 
	accounts, service your needs, or perform other required activities. We educate 
	our employees about the importance of confidentiality and customer privacy. 
	Additionally, our employees are governed by a Code of Ethics that includes the 
	responsibility to protect the confidentiality of each customer's personal 
	information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard 
	your nonpublic personal information. <br><br>Even if you are no longer our 
	customer, we will continue to treat your nonpublic personal information in the 
	same way as if you were still a customer. In addition, we maintain physical, 
	electronic and procedural safeguards to guard this personal information. 
	<br><br><b>MANAGING INFORMATION FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE</b><br>The information we 
	share helps us bring you greater convenience and more choices. We limit who 
	receives customer information and what type of information is shared as 
	described below.<br><br><b>Sharing Customer Information with 
	Affiliates</b><br>We are a Financial Services Holding Company which owns banks 
	located in Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio, a trust company with operations in 
	Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio, a consumer finance company with offices in 
	Pennsylvania, Ohio and Tennessee, and insurance agencies in 
	Pennsylvania and Florida. All of these companies work together to provide 
	financial services to you. We can serve you more efficiently and make it easier 
	for you to do business with us by sharing your information among our affiliates. 
	<br><br>We share personal information about you among our affiliates. The type 
	of information we may share with our affiliates includes the following: 
	</font></div>
	<div align="left"><font size="2">Information we 
	receive from you on applications or other forms, such as your name, address, 
	Social Security Number, assets, or income;</font></div>
	<div align="left"><font size="2"><br></font></div>
	<div align="left"><font size="2">Information 
	about your transactions with us, such as your account balance or payment 
	history;</font></div>
	<div align="left"><font size="2">Information 
	obtained from specialized marketing information firms, such as household 
	demographics; and</font></div>
	<div align="left">
	<p><font size="2">Information we receive from 
	consumer reporting agencies and others, such as your creditworthiness and credit 
	history.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2"><b>Sharing Information with 
	Outside Service Providers</b><br>We may disclose the above information to 
	companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial 
	institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. <br><br><b>Medical 
	Information</b> <br>We occasionally receive medical information about a 
	customer, for example, if a customer applies for insurance from us. If we do 
	receive medical or health information about a customer, we will not share it, 
	except as necessary to maintain accounts, process transactions or provide 
	services the customer has requested or initiated. <br><br><b>Sharing Information 
	with Consumer Reporting Agencies and Other Companies</b><br>In accordance with 
	standard banking industry practice, and as allowed under federal and state law, 
	we routinely provide data about customer loan repayment and other transactions 
	to these agencies and other creditors. <br><br><b>Sharing Information with 
	Courts and Government Entities</b><br>Certain federal and state statutes may 
	require us to disclose information about you. For example, if you are involved 
	in litigation with a third party, we may be ordered to provide information to a 
	court or the other litigant. In these circumstances, we will only disclose the 
	specific information required by law, subpoena, or court order. 
	<br><br><b>Affiliates</b><br>If you are also a customer of any of our affiliates 
	(listed on back) and you receive a notice of that affiliate's intent to share 
	certain information about you with others, you will need to separately notify 
	the particular affiliate if you do not want that information shared. 
	<br><br><b>Keeping Up-to-date with Our Privacy Policy</b><br>We will provide 
	notice of our Privacy Policy annually, as long as you maintain an ongoing 
	relationship with us. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any 
	time. You will be advised of any changes. You can always review our current 
	Policy by contacting us for a copy at 1-800-555-5455.<br><br><b>Telephone 
	Solicitation</b><br>You may request to be excluded from telephone solicitations 
	by us and third party providers working with us. If you do not wish to receive 
	such telephone solicitations, inform the person calling you and you will be 
	placed on a list of people that will not be solicited by phone, or you may call 
	the Customer Service Center of F.N.B. at 1-800-555-5455 or write to us 
	at:<br><br></font></p></div>
	<div align="left">
	<p></p>
	<p><font size="2"><b>Your Opportunity to 
	Choose How Your Information is Used</b><br>By sharing information among our 
	group of affiliates, it is our intention to provide you with a full array of 
	financial services specifically tailored to meet your needs or to save you time 
	if you decide to open an account with one of our other companies. If you do not 
	want us to share nonpublic information about you with our affiliates, you may 
	opt out of those disclosures by writing to us at: <br><br></font><font size="2"></font></p>
	<p><font size="2">You may contact us at any 
	time to change your elections. <br>If your account is a joint account, your 
	decision to opt out will affect all account holders and we will not share the 
	information of any account holder (other than as permitted by law). 
	<br><br>Please note that you may still receive mailings if your information was 
	permissibly shared prior to processing your opt out or if the mailings can be 
	provided without violating your opt out request.<br><br>You should also know 
	that even if you opt out of information disclosure, various federal laws allow 
	us to share with our affiliates and other companies specific details about your 
	transactions and experience with us, including information about your account 
	balances or payment history.<br><br><b>Where to Find out More</b><br>If you have 
	questions, concerns, or comments about our privacy practices or the way your 
	information is maintained and used, we'd like to hear from you. Please call or
