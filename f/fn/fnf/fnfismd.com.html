<p><strong>Information from Children</strong></p>
<p>The Website is meant for adults. We do not collect Personal Information from any person that we know to be under the age of thirteen (13) without permission from a parent or legal guardian.

You affirm that you are over the age of 13 and will abide by the terms of this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>Parents and legal guardians should be aware that this Privacy Notice will govern our use of Personal Information, but also that information that is voluntarily given by children – or others – in email exchanges, bulletin boards, or the like, may be used by other parties to generate unsolicited communications. We encourage all parents and legal guardians to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of their Personal Information while using the Internet.</p>

<p>We may use the services of third party service providers, for example to process payments and other transactions. By using our Website, you grant us all necessary rights and consents under applicable laws to disclose to our third party service providers – or allow such third party service providers to collect, use, retain, and disclose – any Personal Information for purposes of providing services to you, including data that we may collect directly from you using cookies or other similar means.</p>
<p><strong>Access and Correction</strong></p>
<p>To update or correct your Personal Information in the possession of Black Knight, please contact us in the manner specified at the end of this Privacy Notice. However, in those cases where we are acting as a third party service provider to a Lender or Servicer, you must contact your Lender or Servicer. (See the section below titled <em>The California Online Privacy Protection Act</em> below for additional information.)</p>
<p><strong>The California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></p>
<p>As noted above, for some Black Knight Websites we may be acting as a third party service provider to a Lender or Servicer. In those instances, we may collect certain information on behalf of that Lender or Servicer. During these transactions, we may collect some or all of the information on behalf of the Lender or Servicer that is described in the section above titled <em>Types of Information Collected</em>.</p>
<p>The information you submit is then transferred to your Lender or Servicer by way of our services. The Lender or Servicer is responsible for taking action or making changes to any consumer information that is submitted through the Website. For example, if you believe that your payment or user information is incorrect, you must contact your Lender or Servicer.</p>
<p>Generally, we retain the information that you submit to us for 90 days. In some instances, we may retain the information for up to 270 days.
