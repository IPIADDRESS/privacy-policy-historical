<div class="pageTitle">First Niagara Financial Group</div>

<p>At First Niagara Financial Group, we make it our priority to protect the privacy of our customers’ non-public personal information.  We realize that we must earn and keep the trust of our customers every day, and doing so is a responsibility that we take very seriously.  One of the many ways we earn that trust is by maintaining the privacy of our customers’ non-public personal information.  We recognize that our customers are concerned about the confidentiality and security of their non-public personal information and expect us to obtain, keep, use and protect that information in an appropriate and responsible fashion.</p>

<p>This notice is given on behalf of (and in this notice, the terms “we”, “us” and “our” refer separately to) each of the following affiliated companies in the First Niagara Financial Group corporate family (the “First Niagara Family”):</p>

<ul class="productInfo">
<li class="tabs">First Niagara Bank</li>
<li class="tabs">First Niagara Securities, Inc.</li>
<li class="tabs">First Niagara Risk Management, Inc</li>
</ul>

<p>This privacy notice applies only to individuals as consumers and not as operators of a business, and it does not apply to corporations and other organizations.  As required by federal law, we send our privacy notice to our current consumer customers on an annual basis.  This privacy notice replaces all privacy notices previously issued by us and may be amended by us at any time.  If we make a material change to our privacy policy, we will provide our current consumer customers with a revised privacy notice that explains our new policy.  A copy of our privacy policy is available on request or by visiting our Web site at www.fnfg.com.</p>

<div class="pageTitle">Information That We Collect</div>

<p>We collect non-public personal information about our customers from the following sources:</p>

<li class="tabs">Information that we receive from consumer reporting agencies, such as credit scores and credit histories.</li>
</ul><div class="pageTitle">Information That We May Disclose Outside The First Niagara Family</div>

<p>We do not disclose non-public personal information about our customers to parties outside the First Niagara Family except as allowed by and in accordance with applicable law, including as described in the section entitled “Information That We May Disclose to Service Providers and Joint Marketing Partners”.  However, we reserve the right to disclose non-public personal information about our customers to parties outside the First Niagara Family for marketing or promotional purposes.  If you do not want us to disclose non-public personal information about you to parties outside the First Niagara Family for marketing or promotional purposes, please read the section entitled “How To Tell Us Not To Disclose Or Share Information About You Or Not To Contact You” for instructions.</p>

<div class="pageTitle">Information That We May Disclose To Service Providers And Joint Marketing Partners</div>

<p>We may disclose the following kinds of non-public personal information about our customers to companies that perform services on our behalf (for example, check printing and data processing companies) or to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements:</p>

<ul class="productInfo">
<li class="tabs">Information that we receive from our customers on applications or other forms or in other ways, such as names, addresses and social security numbers.</li>

<div class="pageTitle">Information That We May Share Within The First Niagara Family</div>

<p>We believe that the sharing of non-public personal information about our customers with companies in the First Niagara Family for marketing or promotional purposes enables us to better serve our customers.  For example, it allows us to determine our customers’ eligibility for products and services offered by the First Niagara Family and to make our customers aware of those products and services. If a customer does not permit us to share his or her non-public personal information within the First Niagara Family for marketing or promotional purposes, it may limit our ability to offer our full array of products and services to that customer.  Nevertheless, if you do not want us to share non-public personal information about you within the First Niagara Family for marketing or promotional purposes, please read the section entitled “How To Tell Us Not To Disclose Or Share Information About You Or Not To Contact You” for instructions.</p>

<div class="pageTitle">Contacting Our Customers With Offers For Products Or Services</div>

<p>From time to time, we may contact our customers by mail, e-mail or telephone with offers for products or services that we believe may be of interest to our customers.

<div class="pageTitle">Disclosure Or Sharing Of Health Information</div>

<p>We do not disclose non-public personal health information about our customers to parties outside the First Niagara Family (including a government agency) or share non-public personal health information about our customers within the First Niagara Family except as authorized by the customer or to perform insurance functions (for example, obtaining an insurance policy for a customer or administering an insurance claim by a customer) as allowed by and in accordance with applicable law.</p>

If you have one or more joint accounts with us, you may request that your direction apply to any or all other persons named on those joint accounts.  Please allow approximately 30 days for your direction to take effect. <strong>If you previously gave us your direction, you do not need to do so again.</strong> Your direction will continue to apply until you call us and change it.</p>

<div class="pageTitle">Former Customers</div>

<p>We treat information about our former customers the same as we treat information about our current customers.</p>

<div class="pageTitle">Confidentiality And Security Of Information</div>

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard our customers’ non-public personal information.</p>

<div class="pageTitle">How You Can Protect Your Privacy</div>

<p>One of the fastest growing white-collar crimes is identity theft, which occurs when an identity thief gains access to and uses an individual’s personal identifying information without the individual’s knowledge in order to commit fraud or theft.

<li class="tabs">Do not give any of your personal identifying information to any person who is not permitted to have access to your accounts.</li>
