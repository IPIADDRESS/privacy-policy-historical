5.1 To Whom We Transfer Personal Data<br>
<br>
From time to time, we may disclose Personal Data relating to you to those Subcontractors and F-Secure group companies who provide the Services (or parts thereof) regarding which you have entered into an agreement with F-Secure. We will share with these companies only such Personal Data that they necessarily need to work with. We transfer all Personal Data electronically. <br>
<br>
Where our Clients’ Personal Data needs to be disclosed to our Subcontractors, We require, in our contracts with them, that they use such information solely for the purpose of providing services to F-Secure, and under the strict instructions of F-Secure, and with respect to that information, to act in a manner consistent with this Personal Data Policy, your agreements with us and the mandatory laws applicable to F-Secure. <br>
<br>
To ensure better availability and provisioning of Services in various time zones and during different times of day, some of these entities are located in countries outside the EEA. Where personal data is transferred from EEA to outside EEA, F-Secure will safeguard the security and integrity of the transferred Personal Data by appropriate means as required by the law. We will do this by imposing appropriate technical and/or contractual safeguards with regard to relevant Subcontractors and F-Secure group companies (e.g. by using data transfer clauses approved by European Union). &nbsp;<br>
<br>
From time to time, we disclose Personal Data to our distribution partners, from whom you have purchased the Services. We will share with these companies only such Personal Data that is necessarily needed by such distribution partners for purposes of undertaking their agreed activities, but not exceeding those listed above in section 4. The commercial parties to whom we transfer Personal Data are also bound by agreements and by legislation to safeguard the Personal Data. <br>
<br>
We may also disclose your Personal Data to ensure the availability of the Services and the Website according to our rights under the appropriate agreements, license terms or applicable legislation; to protect ourselves against liability or prevent fraudulent activity; or where it is necessary to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain. Kindly note that we will take these kind of activities only if and to the extent the applicable law allows.<br>
<br>
We may also disclose your Personal Data to effect a corporate transaction, in connection with the possible sale, merger, spin-off, or other corporate reorganization of F-Secure, where the information is provided to the new controlling entity in regular course of business. <br>
<br>
We may also disclose your Personal Data to our insurers and to governmental regulatory agencies if and when allowed by applicable laws. <br>
<br>
Please note that there are circumstances not covered by this Personal Data Policy, where the use or disclosure of Personal Data may be justified or permitted, or where we may be obligated to disclose information without consent. Such circumstances may include to comply with an order or warrant issued by or an order made by a court, person or body with authority in relevant jurisdiction to compel the production of information, or to comply with the court rules relating to the production of records.<br>
<br>
5.2 To Whom We Do Not Transfer Personal Data<br>
<br>
We will not sell, rent, or lease your Personal Data to any third parties. Hence, for example, we do not sell your email addresses or your name and personal demographic information to mass marketers. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6. Retaining Personal Data</h3>
<p><br>
We will retain your Personal Data in our databases in accordance with our data retention policies and applicable laws. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to retain such data. For example, we may need or be required to retain information regarding your purchase of the Services and your payment for the same. We may also need to retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; to permit us to pursue available remedies or to limit any damages that we may sustain; to have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later; because of agreements between you and us; or if the law requires it. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7. Protecting Personal Data</h3>
<p><br>
We apply strict security measures and physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of the Personal Data when transferring, storing or processing such data. We apply these security measures and safeguards to reduce the risk of loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of the Personal Data. <br>
<br>
Your Personal Data will be stored in secured locations and on servers controlled by us, located either at our offices or at the offices of our Subcontractors, as described below. Only authorized personnel on register with correct user-identification and password are allowed and able to access the relevant information systems. The data is physically secured in an internal and/or external fully classed data centers/facilities, with appropriate identification procedures. Where our Clients’ Personal Data needs to be disclosed to our Subcontractors, we require, in our contracts with them, that they protect all Personal Data in a manner consistent with this Personal Data Policy and applicable laws. If you choose to contact us through the Website or via emails, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically via the Internet might not be secure.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>8. Accessing and Modifying Your Personal Data</h3>
<p><br>
We seek to ensure that Personal Data is as accurate, complete and current as is necessary for the purposes for which we use such information. We encourage you to inform us if details of your Personal Data are changed (such as change of address or email address).<br>
<br>
If you wish to correct your Personal Data, which you can indicate as incorrect, you can do so by contacting us.<br>
<br>
At any time, you have the right to ask us to provide a copy of the Personal Data that you have supplied and that is retained by us. We have the right to charge a small fee for this service according to the applicable laws.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>9. Technical Data</h3>
<p><br>
Our Services may also collect technical data related to your use of the Services. This is separate from data associated with your use of the Services and associated to the Personal Data collected. Technical data is processed for the purposes of enabling F-Secure to provide you with the Services and for research and development purposes, and it is processed separately from personally identifiable data. Consequently, technical data is processed in a non-personally identifiable manner and F-Secure undertake efforts to render as anonymous and/or obfuscate any Personal Data contained in such data. Technical data is processed in a personally identifiable manner only with your express consent or where we are unable to deliver our relevant Services to you without processing such data in personally identifiable format. <br>
<br>
Depending on the type of Service, you may allow/disallow some technical data being sent, while some of the technical data needs to be sent for respective features of the Services to function properly.&nbsp; F-Secure may further disclose or transfer any of the technical data to its affiliates, sub-contractors, distributors and partners.<br>
