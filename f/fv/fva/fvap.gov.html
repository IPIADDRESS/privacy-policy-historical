<p>We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors - to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record information about individuals.</p> </li>

<li>Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines.</li><br>

<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><strong>Privacy Act Statement</strong> - If you choose to provide us with personal information - like filling out a Contact Us form with e-mail and/or postal addresses - we only use that information to respond to your message or request. We will only share the information you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. We never create individual profiles or give it to any private organizations. FVAP.gov never collects information for commercial marketing. While you must provide an e-mail address or postal address for a response other than those generated automatically in response to questions or comments that you may submit, we recommend that you NOT include any other personal information, especially Social Security numbers. <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/">The Social Security Administration</a> offers additional guidance on sharing your Social Security number. </p>
<p>We maintain a variety of physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. </p>
<p><strong>Use of Measurement and Customization Technology (i.e., “cookies”)</strong> - This website uses  measurement and customization technology known as a "cookies."  Cookies are used to remember a user's online interactions with a website or  online application in order to conduct measurement and analysis of usage or to  customize the user's experience. &nbsp;These  cookies are enabled by default once the user enters the FVAP.gov website, as  the information gathered by the statistics aggregator depends on them.&nbsp; Opt-out instructions for those wishing to  disable cookies can be found below.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of cookies used on this website. A persistent or  multi-session cookie (Tier 2) is saved to a file on a user's hard drive and is  called up the next time that user visits a website. Session-based cookies are  temporary in nature and assist users with the use of FVAP’s automated tools and  are deleted once the visitor closes the browser.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Tier 2 cookies are used to distinguish between summary statistics for users  who have been to the site before and those that are visiting the site for the  first time. The Federal Voting Assistance Program does not gather, request,  record, require, collect or track any Internet users' personally identifiable  information (PII) through these processes. FVAP.gov uses Tier 2 cookies to  remember whether a website visitor prefers to view the default homepage or an  alternative page geared towards more specific content.</p>
<p>Session-based  cookies are used to tie together a user with his/her  data as the user steps through the automated tools for completion of the  Federal Post Card Application and Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot.&nbsp; Upon closing the browser, all session-based  cookies are deleted. </p>
<p>The Federal Voting Assistance Program does not gather, request, record,  require, collect or track any Internet users' PII through either of these  processes. </p>
<p>FVAP.gov collects  aggregate statistics of website visitor characteristics, traffic, and activity.  This information is used to assess what content is of most and least interest,  determine technical design specifications, and identify system performance or  problem areas. The software records a variety of data, including IP addresses  (the locations of computers or networks on the Internet), unique visits, page  views, hits, referring websites, and which hyperlinks have been clicked. Tier 2  cookies are used to distinguish between summary statistics for users who have  been to the site before and those that are visiting the site for the first  time.</p>
<p>The Federal Voting Assistance Program does not use the information  associated with cookies to track individual user activity on the Internet  outside Defense Department websites, and without the user's explicit consent, nor  does FVAP share the data obtained through such technologies with other  departments or agencies. The Federal Voting Assistance Program does not keep a  database of information obtained from the use of cookies. </p>
<p><strong>Opting Out</strong> - 
  Cookies are enabled by default once the user enters the FVAP.gov website,  as the information gathered by the statistics aggregator depends on them.  However, users can choose not to accept the use of these cookies by changing  the settings on their local computer's web browser. <em>Please Note:&nbsp; By changing your  settings and opting out of the use of cookies, some functions of the FVAP.gov  website may be disabled to include use of the FPCA and FWAB automated tools.&nbsp; This is due to functionality of the tools  requiring the use of session-based cookies to tie individual users to data on  the server as information is submitted.&nbsp;  If these session-based cookies are blocked, the user will be unable to  advance past the first page of the automated tool.</em></p>
<p>The USA.gov website, <a href="http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml">  http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml</a>,  provides general instructions on how to opt out of cookies and other commonly  used web measurement and customization technologies. Opting out of cookies  still permits users to access comparable information and services; however, it  may take longer to navigate or interact with the website if a user is required  to fill out certain information repeatedly. </p>

  <h2>Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)</h2>
<p>The FOIA generally provides that any person has a right, enforceable in court, of access to federal agency records, except to the extent that such records (or portions thereof) are protected from disclosure by one of nine exemptions.</p>
<p>The Privacy Act (PA) regulates the federal government's collection, maintenance, use and dissemination of personal information about U.S. citizens and aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Among the rights afforded under the Privacy Act is an individual's right to obtain copies of records maintained on him/her if the information contained in agency files, retrievable by the individual's name or other identifier, is not exempt from release under the provisions of the law.</p>
<p>All requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) should be submitted to the Office of Freedom of Information.  Directions on how to submit a FOIA request are available online, along with additional information on the Office of Freedom of Information’s FOIA program, at <a href="http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/dfoipo/">http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/dfoipo/</a>.</p>
<p>The FOIA known by its legal cite as 5 U.S.C. 552, along with the Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5400.7-R, "Department of Defense Freedom of Information Act Program," can be found at Part 286 of Chapter 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which is available in most libraries.
