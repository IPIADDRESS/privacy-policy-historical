<h2><a name="ckie" id="ckie">Statistical Information and Cookies</a></h2>
<p>For site management, information is collected for statistical purposes. This government computer system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.</p>
<p>Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines.<br><br>
</p><p><em>Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the <em>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986</em> and the <em>National Information Infrastructure Protection Act</em>.
<br><br> Cookies: This site does not use persistent cookies (persistent tokens that pass information back and forth from the client machine to the server). This site may use session cookies (tokens that remain active only until you close your browser) in order to make the site easier to use. The Department of Defense and the Federal Voting Assistance Program DO NOT keep a database of information obtained from these cookies. You can choose not to accept these cookies and still use the site, but it may take longer for the pages to load.

<p>Below is an example of the information collected based on a standard request for a World Wide Web document:
<br><br>
 <em>xxx.yyy.com - - [28/Jan/1997:00:00:01 -0500]<br>
 "GET /site name/news/nr012797.html HTTP/1.0" 200 16704 <br> Mozilla 3.0/www.altavista.digital.com</em>
<br><br>
 <em>xxx.yyy.com (or 123.123.23.12)</em>–this is the host name (or IP address) associated with the requester (you as the visitor).  In this case, xxx.yyy.com, the request is coming from a commercial address. Depending on the requestor's method of network connection, the host name (or IP address) may or may not identify a specific computer.
<br><br>
 Connections via many Internet Service Providers assign different IP addresses for each session, so the host name identifies only the ISP.  The host name (or IP address) will identify a specific computer if that computer has a fixed IP address.
<br><br>
 <em>[28/Jan/1997:00:00:01 -0500]</em>–this is the date and time of the request
<br><br>
 <em>"GET /site name/news/nr012797.html HTTP/1.0"</em>–this is the location of the requested file
<br><br>
 <em>200</em>–this is the status code - 200 is OK - the request was filled
<br><br>
 <em>16704</em>–this is the size of the requested file in bytes
<br><br>
 <em>Mozilla 3.0</em>–this identifies the type of browser software used to access the page, which indicates what design parameters to use in constructing the pages
<br><br>
 <em>www.altavista.digital.com</em>–this indicates the last site the person visited, which indicates how people find this site
<br><br>
 Requests for other types of documents use similar information.  No other user-identifying information is collected.
  </p>
<h2><a name="viewer" id="viewer">Viewers</a></h2>
<p>Documents on this site are made available in several formats, based on a combination of factors, including the format of the original document, whether the look of the original document needs to be preserved, the availability of visitors to open different formats, and accessibility for those with physical limitations.   This does not constitute endorsement of one commercial product over another. Note our <a href="#ext">disclaimer for external links</a>.</p>
