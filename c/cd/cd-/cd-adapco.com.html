CD-adapco is dedicated to helping companies and organizations succeed through the use of engineering simulation. A key factor in delivering this success is STAR-CCM+.
Ensuring customer satisfaction
STAR-CCM+ is developed to be accurate, efficient, easy to use, and grow with the needs of our users in mind. Over the past year more than 600 customer requested enhancements have been integrated into STAR-CCM+.
Four month release cycle
To ensure that users are constantly updated with the very latest advances throughout the product, there are three major releases of STAR-CCM+ every year. Without sacrificing product quality, enhancements and new features are effectively deployed and made available to users within a minimum amount of time.">STAR-CCM+®</a></li>
<li class="leaf has-children menu-mlid-10319"><a href="/products/star-cd%C2%AE" title="Designers of modern Internal Combustion engines face&amp;nbsp;huge challenges to deliver power units which satisfy&amp;nbsp;legislation and have competitive economy, performance&amp;nbsp;and manufacturing cost. In particular, technology&amp;nbsp;advances in fuel injection systems, alternative fuels,&amp;nbsp;combustion systems, multi-fuel operation, downsizing&amp;nbsp;and engine management coupled to ever shorter engine&amp;nbsp;development timescales dictate that analysis is used&amp;nbsp;widely to deliver optimum solutions.&amp;nbsp;
Although CFD analysis of in-cylinder flow and combustion has been established for over 30 years, the demands for increasing accuracy, flexibility, speed of turnaround and closer integration of analysis into engine development programs have never been greater.
To keep pace with developments in engine technology,&amp;nbsp;CD-adapco is continually developing the software to add new&amp;nbsp;capabilities, functionality and the speed and ease with which&amp;nbsp;powertrain engineers can execute projects.">STAR-CD®</a></li>

<li class="leaf menu-mlid-10333"><a href="/products/battery-design-studio%C2%AE" title="Battery Design Studio®, originally created by Battery Design Llc, has been evolving over the 15 years it has been available and it is now part of the CD-adapco stable of products. Combining CD-adapco's ever popular dedicated support model with this leading software in electrochemistry modelling allows even the most occasional analysis user to add value and understanding to a project.
Battery Design Studio can be applied to all cell form factors (pouch, cylindrical &amp;amp; prismatic wound) and will consider all aspects of the design to initially compute volume, weight, and power densities of designs. The comprehensive user interface walks the user through the setup up of their cell including electrode design, chemistry formulation, tabbing strategy, and external packaging to arrive at a complete cell model.
Once a cell is created this can be used to simulate performance over a given test cycle, confirming the models operation, or an appropriate drive or duty cycle enabling the limiting factors of the cell to be understood. These can be identified from simulation output highlighting the evolution of internal quantities, such as lithium concentration, across the electrode pairs within the cell. Such understanding provides insight into how a cell could be improved and a cost/benefit analysis conducted to understand if this is 'good' solution. Uniquely, this cell model can be imported in to STAR-CCM+ using the Battery Simulation Module to enable a detailed flow, thermal and electrochemistry analysis of a battery pack using this cell model to be computed. For further information go to the STAR-CCM+ 'add-ons' page.
Battery Design Studio® can also be used as a neutral environment to compare battery cell test work from various cycler manufacturers. The software contains converters for all popular cyclers, allowing data to be presented in a regular format showing all data. This also enables simulation data to be presented against cycler data and the software contains many specific tools aimed at battery analysis, e.g. Voltage vs. DOD/SOC.
Use the links on the right hand sde of this page to explore the details of Battery Design Studio® and view some of the example cases. Below lists just some of the uses of Battery Design Studio®:

Compute important attributes of a new cell designs, such as nominal capacity, open circuit voltage or total mass, using the electrode dimensions and electrochemistry parameters
Understand the sensitivity of a defined cell to the manufacturing variability of underlying parameters, e.g. variable electrode porosity or active particle size
Simulate the electrochemical response of a cell to a given load, whether power or current, and optimise a design to reduce the total mass or improve the capacity of the cell
Understand and visualise the underlying phenomena that limit the rate capability or capacity of a cell design, which may be a limitation of the active material, electrolyte or current path
Create equivalent circuit models, which capture the response to load of a tested cell, by reading in test data and automatically regressing parameters to populate the circuit model
Finally, complete a cell design which can then be passed to STAR-CCM+ to represent the cell in a detailed three-dimensional model. It can also be multiplied to create a module or pack

The increasing demand from consumers for newer, cheaper and more efficient products is increasingly influencing the way products are designed and produced. Virtual manufacturing processes are recognized to be part of the solution to deliver better products. This goes also for casted goods. To accommodate the ever changing placed upon casting processes simulation methods have to evolve as well. This means expanding the simulation scope both in terms of the complexity of the replicated boundary conditions and processes as well as the detail in which physical modelling is done. An overall understanding of the solidification pattern, possible defect distribution must be understood in order to design the casting process efficiently. This also includes that its micro structure is in the specified range, so that &amp;nbsp;structural requirements can be met.
Technology
STAR-Cast utilizes STAR-CCM+’s free surface modelling technique combined with the melting and solidification model to study investment casting, high and low pressure die casting, centrifugal casting and tilt die simulation. A number of unique features are available to the user of STAR-Cast including; Mushy Zone &amp;amp; Flow Stop Modeling, Criteria Functions for Defect Prediction - Shrinkage, Porosity&amp;amp; Cooling rates. &amp;nbsp;The newly added dimensionless Niyama Criterion extends the capabilities of the previous dimensional version. &amp;nbsp;
Materials
The precision of casting simulation results depends to a high degree on the quality and completeness of the required material data. For this reason, a dedicated material data base is key to assuring quality of simulation: the data stored in STAR-Cast materials database are certified and qualified according to an internal documentation scheme. Integration of data documentation into casting simulation reports is easy. Searches for and retrieval of data stored in STAR-Cast mat is executed via the GUI, which combines easy use with access to full information about datasets. Straightforward data export allows you to assemble the material dataset appropriate to the simulation problem posed and to transfer this dataset to STAR-Cast.">STAR-Cast</a></li>

The interest of the global vehicle manufacturers dovetails well with a long term, more wide spread trend demanding ever greater time between recharges for consumer and hand held devices and other applications using batteries. Such widespread focus on this enabling technology has driven CD-adapco to create a specific workflow and tools aimed squarely at providing simulation insight in to coupled thermal-electrochemical problems found in electrochemical devicesHaving been computing coupled thermal-electrochemical simulations for a number of years and through our long term collaboration with Battery Design Llc, a leader in electrochemical model development, CD-adapco is able to offer an expansive solution for such modelling. This page offers an introduction in to our solutions and the surrounding documents should provide a further resource for advanced reading. To discuss particular technical problems or simulation issues with our experts please contact your local support office.The core concept of CD-adapco's battery modelling technology is the reuse of underlying electrochemistry code in both our battery cell level tool, Battery Design Studio, and our battery pack level tool, STAR-CCM+ Battery Simulation Module. By using the same code implementation across these two products an electrochemist can pass on a model of a battery's electrochemistry, created in Battery Design Studio, which can be used by a thermal engineer to capture the response of a number of battery cells once they are stacked together in a pack. This leverage of each others work allows for a higher level of confidence in the final results and also a more complete representation of the physics modelled within the simulation. This core advantage is complimented by sophisticated, contemporary electrochemistry models which capture the details of a cell's electrodes and tabbing design even when running mutli-cell simulations. The tabbing effect on a cell's performance can be significant and they can contribute to the overall thermal-electrochemical problem, only by considering these details can a 'correct' simulation by arrived at. Further details on the methods we use and examples of these electrode effects can be found on the right side of this page.
Particle level analysis - STAR-CCM+ has a revolutionary solver, called 3D MicroStructure Electro-chemistry, which enables material designers to explore the impact of changes in material design on the performance of lithium ion chemistry electrodes. As more design is applied to the formulation of a cell's electrodes so this tool will enable electro-chemists to simulate the performance of different designs hence avoiding expensive testing and providing insight not possible from alternative methods
Cell Level analysis - Battery Design Studio® is a unique tool that allows engineers to design battery cells, simulate performance, and analyse data from both simulation and test work. The tools contains many utilities and function specific to the battery industry using familiar language and concepts for cell engineers
Pack Level analysis - STAR-CCM+ Battery Simulation Module allows cell level models, created in Battery Design Studio, to be used in a complex 3 dimensional representation of a battery pack. The cell can be replicated along with connecting parts and straps many times to create the pack design, all create using automatic tools within Battery Simulation Module. Within this model all forms of heat transfer (conduction, convection &amp;amp; radiation) can be included and an arbitrary number of material included. Hence both air and liquid cooling can be simulated with one model as well as the many thermally or electrically conducting components surrounding these operating battery cells.
This unique methodology is a collaboration of two industry-leading products to offer a single, integrated solution using CD-adapco’s STAR-CCM+, it's Battery Simulation Module and Battery Design StudioThe ability to analyze all characteristics of a battery pack/module within a single environment and ensure the correct overall performance is a key driver in reducing prototype/testing cost and ensuring reliability of batteries in the industry. CD-adapco has partnered with a number of battery industry and research institutions, such as ASCS (Automotive Simulation Center Stuttgart) and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to validate the simulation process in an industrial environment under very rigorous situations, thereby ensuring this unique methodology remains state-of-the-art.High capacity electrochemical devices are a revolutionary technology and in keeping with the times, the use of unique, state-of-the-art tools such as numerical simulation are critical in ensuring the success of tomorrow’s technology being designed today">Batteries</a></li>
<li class="leaf menu-mlid-13018"><a href="/industries/building-services" title="&amp;nbsp;Energy efficiency is the new buzzword for building construction. Gone are the days when a building's energy usage was barely considered ; new buildings are required to adhere to strict usage guidlines in support of a greener environment. One of the easiest ways to do this is by studying and improving the ventilation system of a building.
STAR-CCM+ has well validated applications to the study of airflow through a room, conference hall, or entire building, using real world ventilation grates and examining the exchange of the entire body of air within a certain time frame. The simulation can be tailored to examine the mean age of air and the number of exchanges per hour. Another application is the examination and removal of pollutants in the air, such as in a closed train station or chemistry lab. Either a steady state examination of the removal of pollutants can be examined, or a simulation of an emergency evacuation of particulates can be performed as well.
Another critical application of the Building Services to greener buildings lies with solar loading. STAR-CCM+ can model solar radiation within a building, including simulation of window glazing to reflect solar radiation. Up to 50% of the heat transfer in an environment can be attributed to solar radiation, making it a crucial design study. In addition, a well-designed ventilation system will greatly improve occupant comfort, a good bonus for any building.
The third major application of Building Services is to examine the airflow patterns around a building, specifically examining the stress on a building caused by wind, and calculating the wind speed for pedestrians walking near the building. As more and more skyscrapers get built, and they are packed in more densely, they begin to dramatically alter the wind patterns through the city. This can create dangerous situations, such as high wind speeds on a building, causing significant stress on a building’s primary load beams and high windspeeds for pedestrians walking in between them. STAR-CCM+ is well validated to perform all types of wind speed simulations.
CD-adapco presents many technologies to assist in the analysis of these and other major applications. Technologies such as radiation modeling, solar radiation modeling, and window glazing modeling assist in thermal comfort simulations, along with being able to define specific ventilation cover types for boundary conditions.
Natural and Forced convection modeling, turbulence modeling, and Conjugate Heat Transfer assist on all types of simulations noted above, especially in air volume exchanges. In addition, RANS and LES/DES simulations assist in calculating wind speed. STAR-CCM+ is able to tie into our partner software Abaqus to perform Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) and load simulations to examine the effects of wind on buildings.
Lastly, STAR-CCM+ of course offers its industry leading meshing and volume extraction technology, and is able to import and clean a huge number of different CAD file formats.">Building Services</a></li>

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is being deployed more frequently to answer the challenging questions left after the initial design phase of process simulation and flow sheeting. CFD can resolve the underlying physics and coupled chemistry in a more detailed manner in 3D space, elucidating the local effects of flow and heat transfer on mass transfer and chemical reactions.
CPI is not limited only to the production of commodity and speacialty chemicals but also covers the sectors like refining, pharmaceutical, glass, cement, steel, food and beverage, pulp &amp;amp; paper. CD-adapco offers solutions for these wide ranging industries under the banner of chemical process industry, especially with our flagship software, STAR-CCM+. STAR-CCM+ is the industry leader in CAE simulation and is able to simulate various unit operations in the chemical process industry. The wide range of physics models in STAR-CCM+ can assist in the design,optimization and troubleshooting of equipment and processes across the chemical industry.
Multiphase flows are ubiquitous in the Chemical industry. Flows with two or more phases and concomitant interphase mass exchange and heat transfer are encountered in bubble columns, stirred tank reactors, fluidized bed reactors and many other processing equipment. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of multiphase flows is a challenging task. Appropriate choice of models and correct definition of boundary conditions and solver parameters are critical in arriving at reliable solutions.
STAR-CCM+ has advanced multiphase flow capabilities such as:

Lagrangian multiphase model (LMP)
Eulerian multiphase model (EMP)
Volume of Fluid (VOF)
Discrete Element Model (DEM)

STAR-CCM+’s offers a unique capability of carrying out Discrete Element Modeling (DEM) coupled with fluid flow. DEM allows a user to model each individual particle, taking in to account, its interaction with other particles as well the fluid surrounding it.
Reactions are at the heart of most chemical processes. They are inherently coupled with other transport phenomenon like fluid flow and mass &amp;amp; heat transfer. A good understanding of the reactive flow behavior and its coupling to the transport processes is essential in design of flow and batch reactors, burners, furnaces, flares etc.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the detail chemistry modeling capability with DARS, a seamless plugin for STAR-CCM+, allows the user to incorporate finite-rate chemistry while keeping the computational time manageable.

<li class="leaf has-children menu-mlid-12971"><a href="/industries/electronics" title="While engineers of previous generations were able to rely on a combination of engineering intuition and experience to design the cooling of their electronic systems, the ever-increasing consumer demands for greater performance in a smaller package, means this type of speculative prototyping is no-longer effective.
Reliance on intuition and trial-and-error prototyping to predict the cooling of complex electronic systems is a certain guarantee for bad results and failure, in addition to burgeoning design and development costs and time. This affects products by decreasing the profit margins, delaying product time to market and increasing product and repair cost. Most importantly, relying solely on physical testing limits the innovation that can be designed into the product.
In this increasingly competitive market place, only numerical simulation can provide the necessary insight into product performance early in the design process. Temperature is a very limiting factor for electronic devices and as devices move to higher power density, the higher temperatures reduce component efficiency and product life.
The need for more sophisticated and intelligent cooling strategies to keep up with rising demands can only be met by designing the electronic systems in an intelligent and sustainable manner using innovative technologies that can identify problems at an early stage. At CD-adapco, we understand this new reality for future electronics systems and have adapted our simulation solutions to offer the best-fit for electronics cooling design.

Our flagship software, STAR-CCM+, offers a no-compromise simulation solution for your Electronics Cooling problems. With STAR-CCM+, there is no simplification of geometry and any complex electronics circuit with its hundreds of components can be handled with ease. Most electronics simulation tools stop with Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT) simulations, the most common physics handled in this area.

STAR-CCM+ offers industry leading conduction, convection and radiation modeling capabilities but doesn’t just stop there. Other advanced physics like liquid cooling which required multi-phase capabilities, fan performance and acoustics which can be handled by rotating machinery and aeroacoustics models, hydrogen build-up from battery decay, water intrusion and many more can be handled accurately and effectively within STAR-CCM+.
In short, STAR-CCM+ is a no-compromise simulation solution for the Electronics industry that can:

<li class="leaf menu-mlid-12999"><a href="/industries/electric-machines" title="CD-adapco’s flagship computer aided engineering code, STAR-CCM+, is a central tool in the prediction of component temperatures within both early state designs and very mature, highly complex CAD models. The thermal challenge within electric machines is to provide a thermal pathway for electromagnetic losses and conduction losses to leave the machine without critical component temperatures within the machine being reached. STAR-CCM+ captures all modes of heat transfers (conduction, convection &amp;amp;radiation) and can be applied to air cooling, water cooling and even oil spray or bath cooling. Such methods reveal a complete thermal understanding of the electric machine and design changes can be suggested. The origins of the temperature rise within an electric machines are through the various electromagnetic and conducting losses during operation. CD-adapco has enabled a close connection between STAR-CCM+ and the electric machine design package, SPEED, also a CD-adapco product. SPEED provides a 2D spatial distribution of the electromagnetic losses within the electric machine. This spatial loss is mapped on to the 3D components within the thermal simulation in an easy to use graphical user interface. Using mapped losses, rather than integral loss values imposed uniformly (which is the traditional way to apply the thermal load) produces more accurate results and higher localised temperatures. Such mapping of losses is not limited to our own electric machine design package and can be done from a large number of commercial electromagnetic simulation tools, e.g. JMAG or FLUX. The recorded webinars available in our videos section of this page highlight the process or contact your local CD-adapco representative to see how STAR-CCM+ can fit in to your workflow.As well as reading in electromagnetic loss distributions from a wide range of commercial tools, STAR-CCM+ further expedites the setup of electric machine problems by creating the detailed CAD model automatically. This benefit is unique to SPEED users who simply highlight the SPEED model of interest and STAR-CCM+ will interpret the data file to create a 3D model ready for simulation. This uses STAR-CCM+’s CAD engine and requires no user interaction. To see a demonstration view the videos listed on the right of this page or contact you CD-adapco contact.STAR-CCM+ also offers the rapid definition of material properties representing components within your electrical machine. Certain components, such as the conducting wires, if resolved completely increase the overall model size and slow runtime considerably therefore these wires are often resolved as a continuous material with anisotropic properties reflecting the wires conductivity and surrounding insulation. STAR-CCM+ uses CAD feature edges to define the anisotropic normals therefore as electric machine models get more and more complex the set up remains straightforward ensuring an engineers productivity improves. This is a great benefit of having the CAD with the CAE tool.Future developments focused on electric machines will see the flow and thermal simulations within STAR-CCM+ complimented with solution of the electromagnetic losses within the same code. CD-adapco is ambitiously adding an electromagnetic capability to STAR-CCM+ and this is now available in a 2D form in the current release. Future releases will see SPEED and STAR-CCM+ become ever closer enabling the coupled thermal and electromagnetic effects to be simulated within one code. See the latest webinar for a glimpse of the future, available in the videos section of this page.STAR-CCM+ in combination with SPEED is an integrated toolset for virtual prototyping of electric machines.">Electric Machines</a></li>

CD-adapco offers solutions to assist oil and gas companies across the entire range of areas that they might operate in.
The Oil and Gas Industry can be aptly divided into two categories. The first, upstream, covers the entire exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons from the earth. This can be further subdivided into several categories. Subsurface reservoirs, drilling, and downhole effects can have a great effect on retrieval.
Companies are increasingly simulating reservoir behavior, improving the recovery rate of hydrocarbons, enhancing operational procedures, equipment, reliability, and safety, all to optimize their operations. These changes all reduce the cost of retrieval for companies, as well as improve the health and safety of their works and protects the environment better. CD-adapco’s tools, can be applied to all hese optimization schemes, such as reservoir flow, well bore flow, and bore/reservoir interaction. In addition, they can be applied to fluid injection, drilling, and drill vessel safetly.
Another subcategory is subsea and flow assurance simulations. Companies are using STAR-CCM+ in a design and optimization method, improving equipment and system design, demonstrating the performance of equipment without building actual models and testing them, and analyzing the integrity of components and entire systems of equipment and pipelines. In addition, they are able to analyze and develop operational procedures, allowing them to proactively improve reliability and safety, instead of retroactively after a drilling accident, improving the quality of life of their workers and the environment, as well as saving them enormous amounts of money in costly cleanup and reparations for damages.
These methods can be applied to insulation design for flow assurance, erosion modeling, and analysis of both internal and external flow induced vibrations, among others.
CD-adapco offers many tools for handling these simulations, including quick meshing schemes such as the surface wrapper, quick pipeline work, fluid-structure interactions through Abaqus, flow assurance through STAR-Olga, and various tools in STAR-CCM+ for development, including Eularian and Lagrangian multiphase analysis, long pipe analysis and discrete element modeling, which helps analyze corrosion, pigging operations, and pipe cleaning and clearing.
STAR-CCM+ can also model complex rheology, as well as the various drilling and flow operations through the D’Arcy and Navier-Stokes equations.
The other major subcategory of upstream analysis revolves around structural, safely, and process simulations. Examples of this include analysis of risers and moorings for offshore oil platforms, marine hull analysis and optimization, and various safety and process modeling. These simulations ensure that equipment is able to do their jobs correctly, reducing work stoppages, safety accidents and, by extension, environmental damage. Applications include Wave modeling, Green-Water Loading, lifeboat design, and helideck operations. Also, CD-adapco provides tools that can be applied to ventilation analysis (both internal and external), dispersion and ingestion of gas and thermal loads, and combustion issues, such as fire, smoke, and flare combustion.
STAR-CCM+ uses a fully coupled solution driver and our surface wrapper tool to improve speed and quality of its results, as well as radiation and combustion models. STAR-CCM+ is even able to model subsea releases, explosions, and blasts which might result from mishaps, providing information quickly for emergency response, or even analyze possible failure points before such mishaps happen, saving time, money, the environment and, quite possibly, lives as well.

STAR-CD is our offering for simulation of IC engines and is being used by more than half of the teams today on the F1 track for engine design.
&amp;nbsp;Some of the areas where CD-adapco products have made a difference in the Sports Industry are:

Racing – Aerodynamics and engine design
Cycling – Aerodynamics, helmet design
Soccer – Ball aerodynamics
American Football – Ball aerodynamics
Yacht racing &amp;amp; rowing – Hull design
Bobsled design
Stadium/Arena design &amp;nbsp;

The impact of Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) in Sports can be understood by taking a glance at the Formula 1 or NASCAR racing standings, where very single team uses CAE to aid in the overall design of their racing cars. The use of CAE in Sports, long confined to motorsport racing &amp;amp; cycling, is now slowly expanding into different sports and CD-adapco is at the forefront of this technological revolution">Sports</a></li>
<li class="last leaf menu-mlid-13017"><a href="/industries/turbomachinery" title="CD-adapco's simulation solutions have a long history of handling the modeling aspects of the leading turbomachinery and power-generation companies like Lockheed Martin, NASA, GE, Liebherr, Rolls Royce, Voith, Siemens, Solar Turbines, Vestas and many others.
Customers have found CD-adapco products highly flexible for producing accurate simulation results, engineering insight, and improved productivity in a range of industries including: blade cooling and heat transfer, torque converters, turbochargers, turbines, compressors, fans and pumps, nozzles, cavities, ducts and nacelles. They include template meshers for axial and radial machines with single and multiple rows including tip-clearance gaps, highly automated tools for geometry repair and complex geometry meshing, and advanced solver methodologies for steady and transient analyses.
In general, turbo-machinery devices are multi-stage with unequal pitches for stators and rotors, and a majority of the flows are highly unsteady in nature. The choice between steady-state and transient methods for these types of applications depends on having the right balance between computational cost, accuracy and efficiency. The nonlinear Harmonic Balance method in STAR-CCM+ is an entirely new computational approach, offering the best of both worlds specifically for periodic flows.
The Harmonic Balance method in STAR-CCM+ is a full decomposition of the Navier-Stokes equations in the frequency domain where the unsteady, transient flow is represented in the frequency domain as a Fourier series in time. All transport equations for momentum, energy and turbulence are decomposed into the frequency domain on the basis of fundamental driving modes, usually a blade-passing frequency or repeating wake modes.
