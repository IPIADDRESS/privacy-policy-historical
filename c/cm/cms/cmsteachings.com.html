<p>This privacy policy tells you how we collect, use, and protect your personal  information. By visiting our website, you accept and agree to the terms and  conditions of this privacy policy. In particular, you consent to our collection  and use of your personal information as described in this privacy policy.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>MINORS</strong><br>
</p>
<p>We do not provide services or sell products to children. If you are below  the age of 18, you may use our website only with the permission and active  involvement of a parent or legal guardian. If you are a minor, please do not  provide us or other website visitors with any personal information.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>POLICY IS PART OF OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE</strong><br>
</p>
<p>Our privacy policy is part of, and subject to, our website's terms and  conditions of use. You may view these terms and conditions on our website.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>THE TYPE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</strong><br>
</p>
<p>Like most places on the Internet, simply by visiting our website you  automatically tell us certain information. This includes basic information such  as your IP address, when you visited, the website from where you came prior to  visiting us, the website where you go when you leave our website, your  computer's operating system, and the type of web browser that you are using.  Our website automatically records this basic information about you.<br>
</p>
<p>And like many other websites, we may use cookies. In plain English, this  means information that our website's server transfers to your computer. This  information can be used to track your session on our website. Cookies may also  be used to customize our website content for you as an individual. If you are  using one of the common Internet web browsers, you can set up your browser to  either let you know when you receive a cookie or to deny cookie access to your  computer.<br>
</p>
<p>We may also collect any data that you provide us by posting it at our  website or by e-mail. You can always choose not to provide us with information.  However, if you do withhold information, we may deny you access to some or all  of our website's services and features.<br>
</p>
<p>Some transactions between you and our website may involve payment by credit  card, debit card, checks, money orders, and/or third party online payment  services. In such transactions, we will collect information related to the  transaction as part of the course of doing business with you, including your  billing address, telephone number, and other information related to the  transaction.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br>
</p>
<p>We use your information to operate our website's business activities. For  example, we may use this data to contact you about changes to our website, new  services, or special offers, resolve disputes, troubleshoot issues, and enforce  our website's terms and conditions.<br>
</p>
<p>As a general rule, we will not give your data to third parties without your  permission. However, there are some important exceptions to this rule that are  described in the following paragraphs.<br>
  We may, in our sole discretion, provide information about you to law  enforcement or other government officials for purposes of fraud investigations,  alleged intellectual property infringement, or any other suspected illegal  activity or matters that may expose us to legal liability.<br>
</p>
<p>Although we do not disclose individually identifiable information, we may  disclose aggregate data about our website's visitors to advertisers or other  third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.<br>
  From time to time, we may use third party suppliers to provide services on  our website. If a supplier wants to collect information about you, you will be  notified. However, you will never be required to give information to a third  party supplier. We restrict the way third party suppliers can use your  information. They are not allowed to sell or give your information to others.<br>

As a  safety precaution, you should also close out of your web browser completely and  re-open it before viewing other parts of the Internet.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>YOUR USE OF INFORMATION AND UNSOLICITED JUNK E-MAIL</strong><br>
</p>
<p>If you obtain personally identifiable information about another website  user, you are not allowed to disclose this information to anyone else without  the consent of the user and our consent too.<br>
  We hate junk e-mail (Spam). Information you obtain from our website about us  or other site users cannot be used by you or others to send unsolicited  commercial e-mail or to send unsolicited commercial communications via our  website's posting or other communication systems. <br>
</p>
<p><strong>YOUR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES WHO ARE  NOT OUR SUPPLIERS</strong><br>
</p>
<p>You may choose to provide personal information to website visitors or other  third parties who are not our suppliers. Please use caution when doing so. The  privacy policies and customs of these third parties determine what is done with  your information.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>AUTORESPONDERS</strong><br>
</p>
<p>We may use autoresponders to communicate with you by e-mail. To protect your  privacy, we use a verified opt-in system for such communications and you can  always opt-out of such communications using the links contained in each  autoresponder message.
