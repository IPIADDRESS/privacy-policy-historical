</p><h3>Risk Disclosure Statement</h3>

<p>

<strong>Margined Trading</strong>
<br>
Margined currency trading is an extremely risky form of investment and is only suitable for individuals and institutions capable of handling the potential losses it entails. An account with Capital Market Services LLC allows you to trade foreign currencies on a highly leveraged basis (up to about 400 times your account equity). The funds in an account that is being traded at maximum leverage may be completely lost if the position(s) held in the account experiences even a one percent swing in value. For example, if one chooses to leverage up to the maximum 400 times account equity, then a margin of $1,000 may control an investment of $400,000. While a 1% upward swing of the positions held in the account may multiply into a $4,000 profit, a 1% downward swing multiplies into a $4,000 loss, i.e. greater than the initial investment. Thus, an account could lose more than the equity it contains. Given the possibility of losing one's entire investment, speculation in the foreign exchange market should only be conducted with risk capital that, if lost, will not significantly affect the investor’s financial well-being.

<p>

<strong>Market Opinions of Our Staff</strong>
<br>
Opinions expressed by our company's representatives regarding the prices of specific currencies and the direction they will take in the future do not necessarily represent the opinion of Capital Market Services LLC, and are not guaranteed in any way. In no event shall Capital Market Services LLC be held liable for losses incurred in connection with any decision made by any party based on information provided verbally or via the internet by our staff, or any delays, inaccuracies, errors, or omissions in such information.

</p>

<p>

<strong>Accuracy of Information</strong>
<br>
Capital Market Services LLC makes its best effort to keep the information on its website as current and accurate as possible. However, Capital Market Services LLC still cannot guarantee the accuracy of said materials. No single source of information, including the website of Capital Market Services LLC, should be used as the sole basis for any financial decision. We will not accept liability for any loss or damage which may arise directly or indirectly from the content or your inability to access the website, nor for any delay in or failure of the transmission or the receipt of any instruction or notifications sent through this website.

</p>

<p>

<strong>Internet Trading Risks</strong>
<br>
Furthermore, there are risks associated with utilizing an Internet-based deal execution trading system including, but not limited to, hardware malfunction, software failure, and Internet connection problems. Because Capital Market Services LLC does not control signal power, reception or routing via Internet, the configuration of your equipment or the reliability of its connection, we cannot be responsible for communication failures, distortions or delays you may experience while trading via the Internet. Capital Market Services LLC employs back-up systems and contingency plans to minimize the possibility of system failure.

</p>

<p>

<strong>Market Risks</strong>
<br>
Placing contingent orders, such as “stop-loss” or “stop-limit” orders, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions, which can become extraordinarily volatile, may make it impossible to execute such orders. All positions involve risk, and strategies using combinations of positions, such as “spread” and “straddle” positions, may be as risky as taking simple “long” or “short” positions.

</p>

<p>

<strong>Money Managers</strong>
<br>
CMS is in no way responsible for any outcome of a client using his own money manager to trade an account on his behalf. CMS strongly advises each client to thoroughly investigate a money manager and his previous trading results before authorizing him to trade on one’s account. Money managers are not CMS employees, and simply use the CMS dealing desk for execution.

</p>

<p>

<strong>Exchange Rate Fluctuations</strong>
<br>
Exchange rates between foreign currencies can change rapidly due to a variety of economic and political events.

</p>

<p>

<strong>Distribution</strong>
<br>
This site is not intended for distribution or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation. None of the services or investments referred to in this website are available to persons residing in any country where the provision of such services or investments would be contrary to local law or regulation. It is the responsibility of visitors to this website to ascertain the terms of and comply with any local law or regulation to which they are subject.

</p>

<p>

<strong>Disclosure Regarding Bankruptcy Protections</strong>
<br>
The transactions you are entering into with CMS are not traded on an exchange. Therefore, under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, your funds may not receive the same protections as funds used to margin or guarantee exchange-traded futures and options contracts, which receive a priority in bankruptcy. Since that same priority has not been given to funds used for off-exchange forex trading, if CMS becomes insolvent and you have a claim for amounts deposited or profits earned on transactions with CMS, your claim may not receive a priority. Without a priority, you are a general creditor and your claim will be paid, along with the claims of other general creditors, from any monies still available after priority claims are paid. Even customer funds that CMS keeps separate from its own operating funds may not be safe from the claims of other general and priority creditors.
