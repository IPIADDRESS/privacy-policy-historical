	</div>

	<p class="summary togglable-toggle has-caret"><a name="usecookies"></a>How does the CMMI Institute use cookies and other tracking technologies?</p>

	<div class="details togglable-content">
	<p>We use cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, statistical IDs, flash cookies, and similar tracking technologies to collect information about the activities of our visitors and registered user over time and across different Sites, such as the pages a visitor views, the links on which a visitor clicks, how frequently a visitor accesses the Platform, and other actions a visitor takes. We also collect log file information from a visitor’s browser such as web request, IP address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, and landing pages. We may use statistical modeling tools to attempt to recognize visitors across multiple devices.</p>

	<p>We may retain the services of third party service providers who may link personal information about a visitor - such name or email address - to other information they may have – for example, past purchases. This information may allow us to identify assumed interests or preferences of that visitor, so that we can provide a visitor with more useful and relevant ads.</p>

	<h3>How to block Cookies</h3>

	<p>You have the ability to control some of our use of cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. You may be able to configure certain browsers to delete or disable browser cookies. Most browsers contain information on how to control or delete cookies. These settings will typically be found in the “options” or “preferences” menu of a browser. You may also wish to refer to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies</a> and <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/browsers/index.html">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/browsers/index.html</a> for information on commonly used browsers.</p>

	<p>Please note that blocking or disabling certain cookies may interfere with certain functionalities of some parts of our Platform. Choices you make about cookies are also browser and device specific. Further, while disabling a cookie may prevent the collection of information in the future, it does not prevent the use of information collected before the cookie was disabled. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking described in this notice will stop.</p>

	<li>
	<p class="summary togglable-toggle has-caret"><a name="useinternetads"></a>How does the CMMI Institute use Internet Based Advertising?</p>

	<div class="details togglable-content">
	<p>We may – or may have third parties, on our behalf - display to a visitor interest-based advertising and other custom content regarding our capabilities, products or services that may be of interest to visitors. This advertising may be served to a visitor on our Platform, or in our emails or on third-party sites or may be placed on other websites. It may be based on assumed interests attributed to a specific visitor, based on the use of our Platform by that visitor, or use information gathered about that visitor over time across multiple sites. They may be based on other interactions you have with us or our Platform. They may be based on other activities and behaviors that you demonstrate online.</p>

	<p>The information collected about a user’s use of our Platform, or across the Internet, the products in which the user appears to be interested, etc., may be used to build an assumed profile of a particular person. To do so, our service provider may place or recognize a unique cookie on the user’s browser and use other techniques, such as pixel tags. If you are using one of our mobile applications, our ad network partners may use and store your mobile device ID or Advertising ID to show ads that they consider relevant to you.</p>

	<h3>How to Opt-out of Interest Based Advertising</h3>

	<p>You may opt-out of receiving interest based advertising as explained below. The opt-out may be provided through specific tracking opt-out cookies. Please note that if you get a new computer, install a new browser, or erase or alter your browser’s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers), this may also clear any opt-out cookie.</p>

	<p>Each visitor may opt out of receiving interest based advertising from advertising networks that may be delivered to them on other websites by visiting the following websites, please visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info">http://www.aboutads.info</a> or <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>

	<p>Mobile device visitors may also download the AppChoices app at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices">www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a> to opt out from interested based advertising served in mobile apps.</p>

	<p>The features above will allow a visitor to opt out of many –but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage.</p>

	<h3>Do Not Track</h3>

	<p>Some browsers give individuals the ability to communicate that they wish not to be tracked while browsing on the Internet. The Internet industry has not yet agreed on a definition of what “Do Not Track” means, how compliance with “Do Not Track” would be measured or evaluated, or a common approach to responding to a “Do Not Track” signal. Consequently, due to the lack of guidance, we have not yet developed features that would recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals in response to California law.</p>
