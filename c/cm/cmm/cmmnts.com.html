			<p>We will not share any lists of e-mail addresses or other personal information with any third party. In any such e-mail from us, we will provide a way for you to “opt out” or choose to decline to receive promotional e-mail from us. We may occasionally find a third-party offer in which we believe you might be interested and may send you information, but we will not provide your e-mail address to the third party.</p>
<p>We may also offer various surveys on the site. If the survey is a news survey or about service satisfaction, we will not share that information. Certain other surveys and contests are promotional in nature, and are often sponsored by or hosted and run by our advertisers.</p>
<p>In such cases, we disclose that we collect and may share the information you provide to enter the contest or complete the survey with the advertiser. Of course, you will always have the choice of whether to enter the contest or complete such a survey, and therefore you will control the decision about sharing your information.</p>
<p>Note to parents and children:</p>
<p>We fully support the intent of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which forbids the collection of personally identifiable information about children under the age of thirteen without the express written permission of their parents. We ask that children do not submit any information about themselves. Anyone using this Site or the Services warrants and promises that they are 13 years of age or older.</p>
<p>Some of the content on our site, including advertising, is provided directly from web servers owned and operated by third parties, and we do not control, and cannot be held responsible for, their use of any information they may collect.</p>
<p>We do not routinely disclose any of our individual reader information to third parties. We may disclose this information in special cases when we have reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights or property of cmmnts.com or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose information to third parties when we believe in good faith that we are required by law to do so, or as otherwise provided in the Site’s Terms of Use.</p>
<p>You can learn more about privacy on the Internet from the following resources: Electronic Frontier Foundation – a civil liberties organization working to protect your rights online. Electronic Privacy Information Center – established to focus public attention on emerging civil liberties issues relating to the National Information Infrastructure. Privacy Issues Page – from the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT). Cookie Central — dedicated to provide full information upon Internet Cookies. The EPIC Cookies Page – links, news, and explanations.</p>
<p>A last word on internet privacy:</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online – for example in the forums, through email, or in chat areas – that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you’re online.</p>

<p>4.

<p>5. You must use your real full name when posting and provide an e-mail address where we may contact you, if necessary, during the registration process. Your e-mail address will not be published on the site, except by you actively choosing to do so. You are limited to one user account on the system. Under no circumstances may you create alternate names, assume secondary identities or use someone elseâ„¢s name for your name.</p>
