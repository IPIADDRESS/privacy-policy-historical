        <p>CmyIP.com is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. To accomplish this, we have implemented a comprehensive Online Privacy Policy that governs all Internet-related communications for CmyIP.com. This policy is subject to change. We will, however, keep this page updated to make users aware of any and all changes.</p>
        <p>Please read our policy and let us know what you think. If you have any questions about this policy, please send us a note at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:contact@cmyip.com">contac@cmyip.com</a>.</p>
        <p>What information do we gather and how is it used? </p>
        <p>Guiding Principles:</p>
        <p>The following principles guide all of our online communications:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>No SPAM! We will never send unsolicited email to our customers or other visitors to our website. We will use email to respond to email messages from customers or to engage in other communication.</li>
          <li>We don't sell personal information gathered online about our customers. Rest assured, we will never provide your email address, or any other information gathered from visits to our website or app, to any external organization.</li>
          <li>If you buy our product, your orders and product deliveries are handled by any of our resellers, the secured online ordering services. Your contact data (like your email address) is disclosed to CmyIP.com for customer support purposes and is kept confidential by CmyIP.com and the reseller. Your billing data (like your credit card number) is NEVER disclosed to CmyIP.com.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>What information do we gather and how is it used?</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Generic data. When you visit our web site, we log general data, including your domain name (e.g. google.com, yahoo.com, aol.com, msn.com, etc.), the name of the web page from which you entered our site, which pages you visit on our site, and, how much time you spend on each page. We use this information to continually monitor and improve our website. None of this information is collected or stored on a personal (customer-specific) level. Specifically, we do not collect your email address and, in fact, have no way of getting it unless you explicitly tell us.</li>
          <li>Personal information which you choose to submit. As a visitor to our website, you may choose to send us a question in email. Anytime you submit personal information for a specific purpose, your information will be used for that purpose only. Our policy is to inform you when you submit that information, exactly how it will be used. In many cases, you can choose how much information to supply (e.g. when sending us email, you may choose to include only an email address -- not a telephone number or mailing address -- for replies.) There may be instances where we require complete information for a particular activity, but, again, it's your choice whether or not to supply it.</li>
