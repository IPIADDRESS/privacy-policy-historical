<p><strong><a href="/interact/terms/section1" id="section1"></a>1.	When This Privacy Policy Applies.</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies whether you are accessing the Site via a personal computer, a mobile device or any
other technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered (each, a "Device") and whether you are accessing
the Site as a registered user (if offered by the Site) or other user of the Site. This Privacy Policy governs only the Personal
Information and Other Information (as those terms are defined below) that may be colelcted about you and does not cover any
such information collected in any other manner (such as by the CMT Channel not through the Site) or by any other website offered
by CMT, the Parent Companies and/or any subsidiaries and affiliates of the Parent Companies (collectively, "Affiliates") or
collected by any other company, unless specifically stated. We may from time to time, combine Information (as that term is
defined below) with other information we collect from other sources, such as information received from our Parent Companies,
Affiliates, marketing companies or Advertisers and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject
to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your use of or participation in the Site or any
particular service, feature, function or promotional activity offered through the Site terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended
or deactivated for any reason. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the Site or any
features, activities or services offered through the Site.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/interact/terms/section2" id="section2"></a>2.	U.S. Governing Law; Safe Harbor.</strong></p>

<p>The Site is designed and targeted to U.S. audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws
of the U.S. We make no representation that this Site is operated in accordance with the laws or regulations of, or governed
by, other nations. By participating in our Site activities, you certify that you meet the age and other eligibility requirements
for this Site as set forth in our <a href="/interact/terms/">Terms of Use Agreement</a>. If you do not meet such age and other
eligibility requirements, please discontinue using the Site immediately as your continued use of the Site indicates that you
are agreeing to the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>If you are located in the European Economic Area ("EEA") and Switzerland, for detailed information on our privacy policy
and practices with respect to personal information transferred from the EEA and Switzerland, please see our Safe Harbor Privacy
Policy located at <a href="http://www.viacom.com/privacypolicy/Documents/VIACOM-610657-v1-Safe_Harbor_Policy.pdf">http://www.viacom.com/privacypolicy/Documents/VIACOM-610657-v1-Safe_Harbor_Policy.pdf</a></p>

<p>If you are located outside of the U.S., the EEA and Switzerland, you use this Site at your own risk and initiative and
you, not us, are responsible for compliance with any applicable local and national laws. If this Site is part of the Flux
platform, by using this Site, participating in any Site activities, and/or providing us with your Personal Information and
Other Information, you (i) consent to the transfer and/or processing of any Information you provide to the Site and to Flux,
(ii) acknowledge that U.S. law may provide a lower standard of protection for personal data than the laws of your location
and (iii) understand that this Site and Flux will collect, transfer, store, process and/or deal with your Information in accordance
with this Privacy Policy and the Flux Privacy Policy and U.S. law. Consequently, to the full extent permitted by law, you

<p><strong><a href="/interact/terms/section3" id="section3"></a>3.	Collection and Use of Personal Information and
Other Information (Other than Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional Opportunities).</strong></p>

<p>When we use the term "Personal Information" we mean information that would allow someone to identify you or contact
you, such as your full name, postal address, e-mail address or telephone number. When we use the term "Other Information",
we mean any information other than Personal Information that may be collected about you(Personal Information and Other Information,
together, the "Information").</p>
<p><strong>a. Information We Collect that You Provide Us.</strong></p>

<p><strong>i. User Registration.</strong> To the extent we offer user registration on the Site, to register as a

newsletters and other periodic information, chat rooms, message boards, electronic mail services, messaging services, auctions,
shopping, registration and member profile pages. To sign up for or participate in these features or functions, you may be
required to provide us with certain Information about you in order for us to personalize and/or allow you to use such features
and functions. For example, to sign up to receive email newsletters, you may be required to provide your email address, date

date of birth. Additional Information may be requested depending on the specific Promotion, but submission of such Information
may be optional. The Promotion's entry page and/or Rules will provide the specific requirements. You may also have the opportunity
to opt-in to receive special Promotions or offers from our third party advertisers, sponsors or promotional partners ("Advertisers")
as a result of your use of the Site in connection with many of these types of Promotions.</p>

<p><strong>b. Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</strong><br> "Cookies"
(which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity. "Web
beacons" (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting
page views, promotion views or advertising responses. The Site and/or third parties may use "cookies", "web beacons" and
other similar tracking technologies (collectively, "Tracking Technologies") to collect Other Information automatically as
you browse the Site and the web.</p>

<p>We use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between associated sites without logging
into each site, understand Site and internet usage, improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on this
Site, personalize your experience on this Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), save your
password in password-protected areas, save your online game or video player settings, enable you to use shopping carts on
the Site, help us offer you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain
and administer the Site and for other purposes described in the "Use of Information", "Other Information Collected by Us"
section below. These Tracking Technologies collect "click stream" data and additional Other Information regarding your visits
to the Site, such as your visits to the Site's webpages, use of our features, and purchasing history or preferences and may
also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the Device you use to access the Site ("Identifier"). Your

as part of this process.</p>

<p>By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that

This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement
service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, "Third Party Advertising Service
Providers") to, for example, serve advertisements on the Site, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze
advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site ("Targeting Services"). These Third Party Advertising Service Providers
may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Site and other websites you have visited. Targeting Services
enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might
be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the
usefulness of certain advertisements to you. See Section 4(b)(i) for more information on this Site's use of Nielsen's proprietary
measurement software to collect and use video viewing metrics and other information.</p>

collect or have access to Information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites when you
use the Site.</p>

<p><strong>iii.	Other Information Collected by Third Party Advertising Service Providers and Advertisers.</strong><br>
The use of Tracking Technologies by Third Party Advertising Service Providers and Advertisers is within their control and

apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your Information by third parties in connection with their advertisements or
promotions and other sites you encounter on the Internet. This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Information that

<p><strong>iv. Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.</strong></p>
<p>Some web browsers may transmit â€œdo-not-trackâ€ signals to the websites with which the browser communicates.
Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend
for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. There currently is disagreement, including among
participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when
they receive such signals.</p>
<p>We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established
and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals. Instead, as described above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory
Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected
for online behavioral advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described in Sections 4(b)(i),
(ii) and (iii).</p>

<p><strong><a href="/interact/terms/section5" id="section5"></a>5. Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional
Opportunities.</strong></p>

<p>CMT may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming
and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so,
users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from CMT, either by registering on the Site or via
their wireless device. Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates
for CMT. The Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user's telephone number or a
wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier's name. Additional Information may be requested
for specific Promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar
survey information. Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending
on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the
Terms of Use Agreement.</p>

<p>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party's
interception of messages or a user's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.</p>

<p>Users that register for CMT's wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged
by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from CMT. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted
otherwise. Under no circumstances will the Site, CMT, its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless
email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number,
or email address.</p> 

<p><strong>a.	Registration.</strong><br> To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration
methods provided for CMT's wireless marketing services. Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the "single opt-in"
or the "double-opt-in" (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of CMT depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services
will require the "double opt-in" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</p>

<p><strong>i.	Single Opt-in Method:</strong><br> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional
messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register
for the service promoted. The user's voluntary submission of the designated word or code to CMT will mean that the user has
freely and affirmatively granted permission to CMT to send text messages to him or her. CMT will thank the user for his or
her registration by sending a "Thank you" message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe
command in any text message from CMT or by sending a text message to CMT that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE"
or "QUIT".</p>

<p><strong>ii.	Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:</strong><br> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or
other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively
consent to CMT's sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or
wireless email address, only if requested by CMT) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site's registration page. 
The user must also agree to the Site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement before the online registration process is
completed. CMT will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the
user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from CMT to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain
name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that
will indicate the user's acceptance of CMT's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message,
the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the
"Confirmation" message at any time provided that CMT may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time
and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while CMT continues to offer the specific
wireless marketing service.</p>

<p><strong>iii.	Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:</strong><br> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or
other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone
number to register for the service promoted. CMT will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless
device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from CMT to that particular telephone
number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message
that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of CMT's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds
to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.
A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time provided that CMT may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing
service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while CMT continues
to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p>

<p><strong>b. Termination of Wireless Services by User.</strong><br> Regardless of which one of the above opt-in
methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from CMT by the following procedure:</p>

<p>A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism
provided by CMT at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE",
"UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT". CMT will terminate the user's registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user.
Any of these words followed by the word "ALL" in the user's termination request will cancel all of the user's registered wireless
services with CMT. If the user unsubscribes from one or all of CMT service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s)
will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user's previous opt-in.</p>

<p><strong>c. Termination of Wireless Services by CMT.</strong><br> A user understands, acknowledges and agrees
that CMT may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing
service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice. CMT may provide notice of terminations or
changes in services on this Site.</p>

<p><strong>d. Use of Information.</strong> CMT will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional
Internet email address, or other Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide
the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use. We will not share any Personal Information with
Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure. We will share Personal Information with
the operational service providers that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you and with the Parent Companies
and Affiliates.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/interact/terms/section6" id="section6"></a>6. Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information
and Other Information.</strong><br>
<strong>a.	Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information.</strong><br> Generally, we do not sell, rent, lease or
disclose your Personal Information to third parties, except if you consent to such disclosure or as described in this Privacy
Policy.</p>

<p><strong>i.	Disclosure to Parent Companies and Affiliates.</strong><br> We may disclose Personal Information to
Parent Companies and Affiliates for marketing and/or administrative purposes. You can choose to opt-out of certain such uses
as described in the "Opting-Out of Certain Uses of Personal Information" Section above.</p>

<p><strong>ii.	Disclosure of Certain Information in Postings Intended to Be Disclosed.</strong><br> Certain Personal
Information associated with a Posting may be intended for disclosure ("Posting Information"), such as username. We will disclose
Posting Information in connection with the display of, and other services relating to, such Posting.</p> 

<p><strong>iii. Disclosure In Connection with Co-Branded Services and Features.</strong><br> The Site may also offer
co-branded services and features, such as events and Promotions that we put together with another company or our Parent Companies
or Affiliates ("Co-Branded Partner") and that may be hosted on the Site and/or our Co-Branded Partner's website. We may share
your Personal Information with our Co-Branded Partner and your voluntary use of or participation in a co-branded service or
feature means that you opt-in and give your affirmative consent to both the Site and our Co-Branded Partner to collect the
Information provided in connection with the specific co-branded feature or service and to use such Information for the fulfillment
of the feature or service and for marketing or administrative purposes. The Co-Branded Partner will be identified on the
co-branded feature or service, along with the Co-Branded partner's privacy policy. If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded
Partner's future use of your Personal Information for marketing purposes, you will need to contact the Co-Branded Partner
directly and the use of such information by Co-Branded Partner is subject to Co-Branded Partner's privacy policy.</p>

<p><strong>iv. Disclosure to Operational Service Providers.</strong><br> We also have the right to disclose your
Personal Information and Other Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining the Site's services,
features, functions and operations. We will refer to these third parties as "operational service providers". We use operational
service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, activities, services, features and functions we bring
you and we disclose your Information to operational service providers for the purpose of providing services to us.</p>

<p><strong>v. Disclosure to Certain Other Third Parties.</strong><br> In addition to the above, we will make your
Personal Information and Other Information available to certain third parties in the following limited circumstances:</p>

<ol>
<li>When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas,
court orders or legal process) or if requested by a governmental agency or other authority as part of an investigation;</li>

<li>If we believe your actions violate any law, rule, regulation and/or the Terms of Use Agreement, including, without
limitation, this Privacy Policy, Rules or Additional Terms;</li>
<li>In connection with Promotions, as necessary to administer the Promotion or as required by applicable laws, rules
or regulations (for example, to provide winners' lists or make required filings as appropriate);</li>
If you opt-in or otherwise agree to have your Personal Information shared with or otherwise disclosed to a third
party for marketing purposes, in which case the third party's use of your Information is subject to the third party's own
privacy policy;
<li>If, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate: to investigate or resolve
possible problems or inquiries; to protect our business and assets or the rights, property or safety of the Site, the CMT
Channel, the Parent Companies, the Affiliates, or any of its or their operational service providers, licensors, suppliers,
Advertisers, customers, users, or any other party; to limit our legal liability; to defend our interests; to enforce this
Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use Agreement and/or to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations or requests by law
enforcement agencies or governmental authorities and/or</li> 
<li>In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, sale, transfer of control, joint venture or other business
combination involving us, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates.</li>
</ol> 

<p><strong>b.	Sharing and Disclosure of Other Information.</strong><br> We may share or otherwise disclose Other
Information with third parties, but we do not disclose Personal Information to them except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/interact/terms/section7" id="section7"></a>7.	Reviewing, Updating or Deleting Certain Information.</strong><br>

Generally, you may review, update or delete certain Information collected by the Site by, if you are a registered
user of the Site and logged into the Site, clicking "Profile" or your display name at the top of the Site and then selecting
"Edit Profile". However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot
be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information. We will allow you to change the
password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Information you have given us in order to keep your information
current, but once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided to us during registration
and which is associated with your User ID. 
You may also exercise certain privacy settings options by, if you are a registered user of the Site and logged into the Site,
clicking "Profile" or your display name at the top of the Site, selecting "Edit Profile" or "Manage Account" and selecting
the "Privacy" tab.	
Certain Information collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements
and will not be deleted upon the user's request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old. 
If the burden or expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the
legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such Information. In such cases, we
will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries. 
Children or Ineligible Teenagers. If we, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates, inadvertently send an email or text message
to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the
age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site ("Ineligible Teenagers"),
the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child's (or Ineligible Teenager's) parent or legal guardian (the "Parent") always
has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained
in the email or message. The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under
the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).</p> 

<p>In addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's
membership must use their child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID to gain direct access to the account and follow the procedures
in the "Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use" Section of the Terms of Use Agreement to terminate their child's
or Ineligible Teenager's membership; alternatively, Parents may send an email to the Site's Privacy Administrator and provide
us with your child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID and request to terminate your child's or Ineligible Teenager's account
and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user's account and Personal Information by any person without the
user's User ID. If a Parent does not have his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID, the Parent will be required
to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the Parent's name, address, telephone and email address, in addition
to the child's or Ineligible Teenager's name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child's or Ineligible Teenager's
date of birth. The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child
or Ineligible Teenager. CMT will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent
wishes to terminate his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. The Parent must then confirm by
sending a reply email to the designated return address. CMT will then terminate the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account
but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address
and email address of the person making the request.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/interact/terms/section8" id="section8"></a>8.	Protection of Information.</strong></p>

<p>While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable
physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Information. However, regardless of our efforts and the Device
you use to access the Site, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private
communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always
secure other parts of the Site. We also limit access to the Site by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized
for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality
will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow similar standards
of security and confidentiality.</p>

<p><strong>Phishing.</strong> Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' personal identity data and financial account
credentials. "Phishers" use 'spoofed' e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into
