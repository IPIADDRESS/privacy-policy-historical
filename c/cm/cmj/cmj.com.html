<p>CMJ Network, Inc. ("CMJ") provides a variety of online services ("Services") through its websites located at <a href=" http://www.cmj.com">www.cmj.com</a>, <a href="http://www.palavista.com">www.palavista.com</a> and <a href="http://www.findsongs.com"> www.findsongs.com</a> (collectively, the "Sites").

</p><p>CMJ Network, Inc. ("CMJ") respects the privacy of those who visit www.cmj.com ("users" or "visitors").  While we collect information from visitors, we do not release personally identifiable information about visitors without their permission except as set forth within this Privacy Policy, our Artist Services Terms of Service, and other published guidelines.

</p><p>Note that by using the Services you signify your agreement to this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use the Services.  This Policy is subject to change by CMJ from time to time.  Your continued use of the Services subsequent to changes to this Policy will mean that you accept the changes.  We ask that you periodically review this Policy to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version.  If you have any questions regarding this Policy, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:feedback@cmj.com">[feedback@cmj.com]</a>.

</p><p><b>The information we gather.</b><br>
In order to use certain Services you are required to provide us with an e-mail address and password, as well as certain personally identifying information.  CMJ also collects non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregate use statistics for the Services.  We collect such non-personally identifiable information in part through the use of "cookies" - that is, small text files placed on your computer's hard drive.

</p><p>Please note that advertisers and other third parties may collect information about you, through cookies or other technologies, when you visit their websites or when they serve advertisements through the Services.  Also, the Services contain links to other third party websites, which may or may not be operated in conjunction with CMJ.  You acknowledge that we do not monitor or control the information collection or privacy practices of third parties, and are not responsible for their practices or the content of their websites, including their use of any information (such as IP number, browser type, or operating system) collected when you "click through" links to their sites.  You should contact such third parties if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies.

</p><p>The Services are not directed toward children (minors under thirteen years of age).  We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.

</p><p>CMJ does not control the acts of visitors to the Sites.  All users should be aware that, when they disclose personally identifiable information in a bulletin board, chat room, or other forum or public area of the Sites, the information may be collected and used by others for the purposes of distributing unsolicited communications.  In the event that you encounter any CMJ user who is improperly collecting or using information about you or other users, please contact us at <a href="mailto:feedback@cmj.com">[feedback@cmj.com]</a>.

</p><p><b>How we use (and do not use) the information we gather.</b><br> 
(1) Non-personally identifiable information: We use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful Services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Sites.  We may provide statistical information based on this data to advertisers, affiliates, and other current and potential business partners.</p><p>

CMJ reserves the right to reprint posts and commentary from registered users of CMJ's Bulletin Boards in print form in CMJ New Music Report and/or CMJ New Music Monthly. 

</p><p>(2) Personally identifiable information:  
We reserve the right to disclose information concerning any visitor to the Sites as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business.  Specifically, but without limitation, we reserve the right to disclose such information when a visitor is in violation of our Terms of Service or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably suspected of partaking) in any harmful, infringing, or illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, and to disclose such information in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests, as otherwise required by law, or in response to allegations of infringement.  We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers or Services for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution, or to suspend or terminate your use of any Services in connection with any suspected illegal activity.

</p><p>You may choose to "opt out" of receiving promotional materials related to third party goods or services.  If you do not "opt out" of receiving such promotional materials, CMJ reserves the right to release any personally identifiable registration information regarding you to third parties who provide goods or services that we believe may be of interest to you.  If you decide that you would like to discontinue receiving promotional information from such third parties, please contact those third parties directly, or contact us at <a href="mailto:feedback@cmj.com">[feedback@cmj.com]</a> and we will advise such third parties that you wish to discontinue receiving their promotional information.  Please note that we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use information received either from CMJ or independently.

</p><p>CMJ may occasionally need to send you messages pertaining to your use of the Services, and you will not be able to "opt out" of receiving such messages.  We will not release your credit card information to third parties unless necessary to complete a transaction between you and such a third party.  

</p><p>If and when CMJ sponsors promotions or sweepstakes, or third parties sponsor promotions or sweepstakes in conjunction with CMJ, either CMJ or the third party may post relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration area for the promotion or sweepstakes.  That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, will govern that particular promotion or sweepstakes.

</p><p>Changing personal information.  If you would like to change your personally identifiable information in CMJ's database, please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@cmj.com">[help@cmj.com]</a>, and we will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request.  Keep in mind, however, that there may be residual information that will remain within CMJ databases, access logs, and other records, which may contain outdated personally identifiable information. The residual information will not be used for commercial purposes; however CMJ reserves the right, from time to time, to re-contact former users of the Services.
