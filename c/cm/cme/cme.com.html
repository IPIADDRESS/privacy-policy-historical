deliver more relevant content and product offerings and thus offer you better services.</p>
<p>The information we collect will vary depending upon the function or process you select.

<p>As part of our services, we also use cookies. A cookie is a message sent to your browser from a
Web server that is stored on your computer's hard drive. The message is sent back to the Web server
whenever the browser requests a page from that server. Many commercial Internet sites use cookies.
While a code in the cookie file enables the site to label you as a particular user, it does not
identify you by name or address unless you have provided the site with such information or set up
preferences in your browser to do so automatically. You may opt out of accepting cookies by
changing the settings on your browser. However, rejecting cookies may prevent you from using
certain functions and you may have to repeatedly enter information to take advantage of services or
promotions. In general, cookies allow us to identify you as a particular user and thus provide you
with a more customized service. We may also use cookies to track customer or user requests,
inquiries and traffic patterns or to determine audience size and repeated usage.</p>

law, provide information about you without your permission to certain persons or organizations,
such as: regulatory and law enforcement authorities; our affiliated companies. We may also disclose

<p><span class="subTitle">What security procedures do we use to guard against the loss, misuse,
alteration, or theft of your information?</span>
</p>
<p>We use a secure server and security protocol to safeguard the information you submit.</p>
<p>To help ensure the security of your personal and financial information that you submit to us
(other than via an e-mail message), we use security software to encrypt the information before and
during its transmission through the Internet. We only allow information to be submitted for
transmission if your browser is compatible with our security software. If your browser is not
compatible, you will receive a message indicating your transaction cannot be completed because of
the security risk.</p>
<p>E-mail messages are not secure. Our security software does not encrypt e-mail messages. E-mail
messages traveling through the Internet are subject to viewing, alteration, and copying by
potentially anyone on the Internet.</p>
<p>We take seriously the issue of safeguarding your privacy online. However, please note that you
should exercise discretion with respect to the submission of any personal or financial information.
Please keep in mind that transmitting information via the Internet is never completely secure and
thus any information submitted may be intercepted, collected, used or disclosed by others. We
encourage customers to either send confidential correspondence through the postal service or use
the telephone to speak directly to our employees. We are not responsible for the security of
confidentiality of communications you send to us through the Internet using e-mail messages.</p>
<p><span class="subTitle">What can you do as a customer to help maintain security?</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilize the latest version of Netscape and/or Microsoft Explorer. Our site is most secure when
using one of these browsers.</li>
<li>Keep your User ID and PIN confidential.</li>
<li>Utilize a PIN unique to you and change it frequently.</li>
<li>Make sure others are not watching you enter your User ID and/or PIN on your keyboard when using
protected areas of cme.com.</li>
<li class="cmeList">Do not leave your computer unattended while logged onto protected areas of
cme.com. After you,ve finished accessing your information, exit the protected area within cme.com.
This ensures that no one can access your policy information if you leave your computer and your
session has not been timed out.</li>
