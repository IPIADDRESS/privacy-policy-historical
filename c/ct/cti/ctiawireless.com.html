As Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg said, “[T]here are billions of dollars going into spectrum efficiency every day.”2 The reason is simple: efficient use of industry’s spectrum resources is critical to consumers’ mobile experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESpectrum efficiency has also been a hallmark of the U.S. focus on flexible, exclusive-use licensing—a framework that has driven America’s wireless leadership. The FCC has recognized that exclusive-use licensed bands are often the most intensively used and serve as a “runway” for the launch of innovation services.3 Indeed, it was on exclusively-licensed spectrum that the industry migrated to digital mobile, evolved from 2G to 3G service, and produced global leadership by the U.S. in 4G—and now is leading the world in 5G.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJust recently, President Trump set a goal that the U.S. should “have more 5G spectrum than any other country in the world” by 2020. While we work with policymakers to answer that call, the industry continues to take steps to be smarter and more efficient with our spectrum holdings. Specifically, the industry is working to refarm existing spectrum, quickly deploy new spectrum assets, and upgrade to new generations of wireless networks, all while deploying denser wireless infrastructure and other techniques that enhance spectral efficiency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWireless providers will continue to make efficient use of spectrum assets in order to ensure they deliver the wireless experience that consumers demand—and help ensure we continue the lead the world in 5G.

The FCC has recognized that exclusive-use licensed bands are often the most intensively used and serve as a “runway” for the launch of innovation services.3 Indeed, it was on exclusively-licensed spectrum that the industry migrated to digital mobile, evolved from 2G to 3G service, and produced global leadership by the U.S. in 4G—and now is leading the world in 5G.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJust recently, President Trump set a goal that the U.S. should “have more 5G spectrum than any other country in the world” by 2020. While we work with policymakers to answer that call, the industry continues to take steps to be smarter and more efficient with our spectrum holdings. Specifically, the industry is working to refarm existing spectrum, quickly deploy new spectrum assets, and upgrade to new generations of wireless networks, all while deploying denser wireless infrastructure and other techniques that enhance spectral efficiency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWireless providers will continue to make efficient use of spectrum assets in order to ensure they deliver the wireless experience that consumers demand—and help ensure we continue the lead the world in 5G.

China, for instance, has more than 14 wireless cell sites per 10,000 people, compared to 4.7 in the United States, and more than 5 sites per every 10 square miles, compared to 0.4 in the U.S., according to a recent study.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need to keep our foot on the gas—and continue to work together, particularly on spectrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThankfully, the Administration has recognized this and is developing a National Spectrum Strategy to give the wireless industry the certainty required to plan for and build out the best and most secure 5G networks possible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo today we’re laying out a three-point call to action to inform the Administration’s National Spectrum Strategy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we’re calling for a clear, 5-year schedule of new auctions to put more high-, mid-, and low-band spectrum in the hands of America’s wireless industry. Freeing up these spectrum bands will create a spectrum stimulus, boosting the U.S. economy by $391 billion and create 1.8 million new jobs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd we need to focus on mid-band. While the FCC has put the U.S. ahead of many of our global peers when it comes to high-band spectrum, the U.S. lags far behind other countries—including China—in mid-band spectrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMid-band is critical to 5G because it offers high capacity for data-intensive applications as well as the ability to transmit signals over longer distances. By next year, other countries will have released four-times more mid-band spectrum than the United States. With no auctions currently scheduled, we need to move quickly to free up more of this needed spectrum to support our 5G networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the National Spectrum Strategy should recommit to the free-market policies that have made America the proving ground for wireless innovation. In fact, flexible, competition-enhancing policies were key to the U.S. winning the race to 4G and are exactly what we need to reach 5G’s full potential while enhancing our nation’s economic and national security.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThird, the National Spectrum Strategy should articulate a vision for modernizing how the U.S. government approaches spectrum management to both benefit government operations and encourage private sector development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E* * *\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E5G is going to be unlike any other generation of wireless. These networks will transform the way we live and work, powering everything from artificial intelligence, to remote surgery, to precision agriculture, and the innovations of tomorrow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo realize this future and win the race to 5G, we need an action-oriented national strategy to allocating and managing spectrum built on the competitive markets and spectrum policies that made America’s wireless industry the world leader today. And by doubling down on that approach as the 5G race begins in earnest, we’ll be well-positioned to address the coordinated investment strategy that China and other countries are taking.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmerica’s wireless is committed to 5G—and a National Spectrum Strategy is a tremendous opportunity to supercharge the ongoing 5G rollout in the U.S. Let’s make

As Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg said, “[T]here are billions of dollars going into spectrum efficiency every day.”2 The reason is simple: efficient use of industry’s spectrum resources is critical to consumers’ mobile experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESpectrum efficiency has also been a hallmark of the U.S. focus on flexible, exclusive-use licensing—a framework that has driven America’s wireless leadership. The FCC has recognized that exclusive-use licensed bands are often the most intensively used and serve as a “runway” for the launch of innovation services.3 Indeed, it was on exclusively-licensed spectrum that the industry migrated to digital mobile, evolved from 2G to 3G service, and produced global leadership by the U.S. in 4G—and now is leading the world in 5G.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJust recently, President Trump set a goal that the U.S. should “have more 5G spectrum than any other country in the world” by 2020. While we work with policymakers to answer that call, the industry continues to take steps to be smarter and more efficient with our spectrum holdings. Specifically, the industry is working to refarm existing spectrum, quickly deploy new spectrum assets, and upgrade to new generations of wireless networks, all while deploying denser wireless infrastructure and other techniques that enhance spectral efficiency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWireless providers will continue to make efficient use of spectrum assets in order to ensure they deliver the wireless experience that consumers demand—and help ensure we continue the lead the world in 5G.

Several countries now have commercial 5G services in place (although limited to certain subscribers, or specific geographical areas initially). As we describe in this report, by 2020 we expect to see around 80 operators in more than 40 countries worldwide having made 5G services available to their subscribers. 5G device availability is expected to expand rapidly in the remained of 2019. Operators are working with industrial partners to develop 5G services for specific industries, as well as offering 5G mobile broadband (offering faster speeds and quicker response times) to

As Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg said, “[T]here are billions of dollars going into spectrum efficiency every day.”2 The reason is simple: efficient use of industry’s spectrum resources is critical to consumers’ mobile experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESpectrum efficiency has also been a hallmark of the U.S. focus on flexible, exclusive-use licensing—a framework that has driven America’s wireless leadership. The FCC has recognized that exclusive-use licensed bands are often the most intensively used and serve as a “runway” for the launch of innovation services.3 Indeed, it was on exclusively-licensed spectrum that the industry migrated to digital mobile, evolved from 2G to 3G service, and produced global leadership by the U.S. in 4G—and now is leading the world in 5G.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJust recently, President Trump set a goal that the U.S. should “have more 5G spectrum than any other country in the world” by 2020. While we work with policymakers to answer that call, the industry continues to take steps to be smarter and more efficient with our spectrum holdings. Specifically, the industry is working to refarm existing spectrum, quickly deploy new spectrum assets, and upgrade to new generations of wireless networks, all while deploying denser wireless infrastructure and other techniques that enhance spectral efficiency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWireless providers will continue to make efficient use of spectrum assets in order to ensure they deliver the wireless experience that consumers demand—and help ensure we continue the lead the world in 5G.

China, for instance, has more than 14 wireless cell sites per 10,000 people, compared to 4.7 in the United States, and more than 5 sites per every 10 square miles, compared to 0.4 in the U.S., according to a recent study.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need to keep our foot on the gas—and continue to work together, particularly on spectrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThankfully, the Administration has recognized this and is developing a National Spectrum Strategy to give the wireless industry the certainty required to plan for and build out the best and most secure 5G networks possible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo today we’re laying out a three-point call to action to inform the Administration’s National Spectrum Strategy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we’re calling for a clear, 5-year schedule of new auctions to put more high-, mid-, and low-band spectrum in the hands of America’s wireless industry. Freeing up these spectrum bands will create a spectrum stimulus, boosting the U.S. economy by $391 billion and create 1.8 million new jobs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd we need to focus on mid-band. While the FCC has put the U.S. ahead of many of our global peers when it comes to high-band spectrum, the U.S. lags far behind other countries—including China—in mid-band spectrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMid-band is critical to 5G because it offers high capacity for data-intensive applications as well as the ability to transmit signals over longer distances. By next year, other countries will have released four-times more mid-band spectrum than the United States. With no auctions currently scheduled, we need to move quickly to free up more of this needed spectrum to support our 5G networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the National Spectrum Strategy should recommit to the free-market policies that have made America the proving ground for wireless innovation. In fact, flexible, competition-enhancing policies were key to the U.S. winning the race to 4G and are exactly what we need to reach 5G’s full potential while enhancing our nation’s economic and national security.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThird, the National Spectrum Strategy should articulate a vision for modernizing how the U.S. government approaches spectrum management to both benefit government operations and encourage private sector development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E* * *\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E5G is going to be unlike any other generation of wireless. These networks will transform the way we live and work, powering everything from artificial intelligence, to remote surgery, to precision agriculture, and the innovations of tomorrow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo realize this future and win the race to 5G, we need an action-oriented national strategy to allocating and managing spectrum built on the competitive markets and spectrum policies that made America’s wireless industry the world leader today. And by doubling down on that approach as the 5G race begins in earnest, we’ll be well-positioned to address the coordinated investment strategy that China and other countries are taking.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmerica’s wireless is committed to 5G—and a National Spectrum Strategy is a tremendous opportunity to supercharge the ongoing 5G rollout in the U.S. Let’s make it happen, together.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n","show_glossary":false,"infographic":null,"show_document":true,"document":[{"ID":17099,"post_author":"13","post_date":"2019-04-02
