                    solely to the online information collection and use practices of our Web 
                    site located at www.ctidirectory.com (this "Web Site"), and not to any 
                    sub domains of this Web Site. We recognize that many visitors and users 
                    of this Web Site are concerned about the information they provide to us, 
                    and how we treat that information. This Privacy Statement, which may be 
                    updated from time to time, has been developed to address those concerns.<br>
                    Your use of this Web Site indicates to us that you have read and accept 
                    our privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy Statement. If you 
                    have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Statement, please

                    <h1>WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU DO WE COLLECT? </h1>
                    When you visit our Web Site, you may provide us with two types of 
                    information: (1) personally identifiable information that you knowingly 
                    choose to disclose, which is collected on an individual basis, and (2) 
                    general user information that does not contain personally identifiable 
                    information, which is collected on an aggregate basis as you browse the 
                    Web Site. In some cases, if you choose not to provide us with requested 
                    information, you may not be able to access all of our Web Site's content 
                    or services.<br>
                    <h2>Personally Identifiable Information You Choose to Provide. </h2>
                    We may ask 
                    for certain personal information from you for the purpose of providing 
                    to you content and/or services that you request. For example, if you 
                    email us to indicate an interest in receiving press releases about 
                    Canadian Trade Index, you are asked to submit your name, address and 
                    e-mail address, which we retain on file, so that we may send you the 
                    information that you requested. If you indicate in your email that you 
                    are a member of the press, we may also send you information regarding 
                    our business. We may retain a record of users who have contacted us in 
                    order to respond properly to questions or concerns and for purposes of 
                    future communications.<br>
                    <h2>Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect.</h2>
                    Cookies/ Web server logs: Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web Site 
                    utilizes standard technology called "cookies" and Web server logs to 
                    collect information about how our Web Site is used. Cookies are a 
                    feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the 
                    computer used to access a Web site. Cookies are small pieces of data 
                    that are stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive. 
                    Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the 
                    date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web Site, 
                    and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web Site. This 
                    information is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information 
                    is associated with you as an individual. You can, of course, disable 
                    cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or 
                    options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts 
                    of our Web Site will not operate correctly if you disable cookies. You 
                    should consult with your browser's provider/manufacturer if you have any 
                    questions regarding disabling cookies.<br>
                    
                    <h1>HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT? </h1><br>
                    We use your personally identifiable information to provide you with the 
                    information or content that you have requested, and, in some cases, to 
                    contact you about our programs, products, features or services. If you 
                    no longer wish to receive press releases or any other type of 
                    information from us, you may send us an email through our Contact E-mail 
                    to change your preferences.<br>
                    <br>
                    We use non-identifying information collected on our Web Site in the 
                    aggregate to better understand your use of the Web Site and to enhance 
                    your enjoyment and experience. For example, we may use the information 
                    to improve the design and content of our Web Site or to analyze the 
                    programs and services that we offer.<br>
                    <br>
                    We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on 
                    our behalf. Our employees, agents and contractors who have access to 
                    personally identifiable information are required to protect the 
                    information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement.<br>
                    <br>
                    We may provide access to your personally identifiable information when 
                    legally required to do so, to cooperate with police investigations or 
                    other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use 
                    of our Web Site, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights, or 
                    to protect the rights and safety of visitors to this Web Site or the 
                    public. In those instances, the information is provided only for that 
                    limited purpose.<br>
                    <br>
                    We will not share your personally identifiable information in ways 
                    unrelated to those described above without providing you with an 
                    opportunity to opt out of such use or otherwise prohibit such unrelated 
                    uses.<br>
                    <h1>HOW DO YOU ACCESS AND/OR MODIFY YOUR INFORMATION OR CHOICES? </h1><br>
                    If you visit our Web Site and volunteer personally identifiable information, 
                    you may modify, update or delete such information at any time by send us an email 
                    through our Contact E-mail. You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible 
                    to completely remove or modify information in our databases. In addition, please be aware 
                    that your ability to opt out from receiving marketing and promotional materials does not change 
                    our right to contact you regarding your use of our Web Site.<br>
                    
                    <h1>PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR CHILDREN USING THE INTERNET </h1><br>
                    Protecting children's privacy is important to us. For that reason, we do not 
                    collect or maintain information on our Web Site from those we actually 
                    know are under the age of 13, nor is any part of our Web Site targeted 
                    to attract anyone under 13. We request that all visitors to our Web Site 
                    who are under 13 not disclose or provide any personally identifiable 
                    information. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with 
                    personally identifiable information, we will delete that child's 
                    personally identifiable information from our records.<br>
                    
                    <h1>DATA SECURITY </h1>
                    We take reasonable steps to maintain the security of the personally identifiable 
                    information that we collect, including limiting the number of people who 
                    have physical access to our database servers, as well as installing 
                    electronic security systems that guard against unauthorized access. 
                    However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 
                    completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security 
                    of any information that you transmit to us, so you do so at your own 
                    risk.<br>
                    
                    <h1>CONSENT TO TRANSFER </h1>
                    This Web Site is operated in Canada. If you are located outside of Canada, please 
                    be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred

                    and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.<br>

                    privacy statement of each and every Web site that collects personally
