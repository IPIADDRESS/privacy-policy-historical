In order to realize this potential, drones need a secure and reliable communications network. This is where wireless networks come in. Powered by licensed spectrum, they provide the coverage, reliability, security, and service quality needed for safe commercial drone applications.

We launched our Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Working Group to bring the industry together to advocate for the spectrum and wireless infrastructure policies that will enable drone communications. CTIA partners with all levels of government on developing drone policy and we’re proud to be part of the FAA’s Drone Advisory Committee, the FCC’s Technological Advisory Council, and a close partner of NASA’s on research projects related to low-altitude drone traffic management.\r\n\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003EQ: What is needed from a policy perspective to make commercial drone deployment a reality?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\r\n\r\nA:  Policymakers should take the following steps to create a regulatory environment that ensures the benefits promised by the safe, commercial operation of drones will be realized:\r\n\u003Col\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEndorse commercial wireless networks for UAS communications\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E.

China, for instance, has more than 14 wireless cell sites per 10,000 people, compared to 4.7 in the United States, and more than 5 sites per every 10 square miles, compared to 0.4 in the U.S., according to a recent study.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need to keep our foot on the gas—and continue to work together, particularly on spectrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThankfully, the Administration has recognized this and is developing a National Spectrum Strategy to give the wireless industry the certainty required to plan for and build out the best and most secure 5G networks possible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo today we’re laying out a three-point call to action to inform the Administration’s National Spectrum Strategy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we’re calling for a clear, 5-year schedule of new auctions to put more high-, mid-, and low-band spectrum in the hands of America’s wireless industry. Freeing up these spectrum bands will create a spectrum stimulus, boosting the U.S. economy by $391 billion and create 1.8 million new jobs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd we need to focus on mid-band. While the FCC has put the U.S. ahead of many of our global peers when it comes to high-band spectrum, the U.S. lags far behind other countries—including China—in mid-band spectrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMid-band is critical to 5G because it offers high capacity for data-intensive applications as well as the ability to transmit signals over longer distances. By next year, other countries will have released four-times more mid-band spectrum than the United States. With no auctions currently scheduled, we need to move quickly to free up more of this needed spectrum to support our 5G networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the National Spectrum Strategy should recommit to the free-market policies that have made America the proving ground for wireless innovation. In fact, flexible, competition-enhancing policies were key to the U.S. winning the race to 4G and are exactly what we need to reach 5G’s full potential while enhancing our nation’s economic and national security.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThird, the National Spectrum Strategy should articulate a vision for modernizing how the U.S. government approaches spectrum management to both benefit government operations and encourage private sector development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E* * *\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E5G is going to be unlike any other generation of wireless. These networks will transform the way we live and work, powering everything from artificial intelligence, to remote surgery, to precision agriculture, and the innovations of tomorrow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo realize this future and win the race to 5G, we need an action-oriented national strategy to allocating and managing spectrum built on the competitive markets and spectrum policies that made America’s wireless industry the world leader today. And by doubling down on that approach as the 5G race begins in earnest, we’ll be well-positioned to address the coordinated investment strategy that China and other countries are taking.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmerica’s wireless is committed to 5G—and a National Spectrum Strategy is a tremendous opportunity to supercharge the ongoing 5G rollout in the U.S. Let’s make

substantial increases in data speed, service quality, and network capacity. This new technology will rely on a much wider range of spectrum (from 600 MHz to millimeter wave) than current 4G LTE networks. To achieve this significant leap forward, two things need to happen: policymakers must reallocate spectrum for 5G uses and service providers will need to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in new infrastructure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis study examines the economic impact of re-allocating 400 MHz of licensed mid-band spectrum between 3.45 GHz and 4.2 GHz for 5G networks. We conclude that wireless providers will invest in excess of $154 billion on infrastructure to deliver 5G services over this mid-band spectrum over a seven-year buildout period.

substantial increases in data speed, service quality, and network capacity. This new technology will rely on a much wider range of spectrum (from 600 MHz to millimeter wave) than current 4G LTE networks.

China, for instance, has more than 14 wireless cell sites per 10,000 people, compared to 4.7 in the United States, and more than 5 sites per every 10 square miles, compared to 0.4 in the U.S., according to a recent study.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need to keep our foot on the gas—and continue to work together, particularly on spectrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThankfully, the Administration has recognized this and is developing a National Spectrum Strategy to give the wireless industry the certainty required to plan for and build out the best and most secure 5G networks possible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo today we’re laying out a three-point call to action to inform the Administration’s National Spectrum Strategy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we’re calling for a clear, 5-year schedule of new auctions to put more high-, mid-, and low-band spectrum in the hands of America’s wireless industry. Freeing up these spectrum bands will create a spectrum stimulus, boosting the U.S. economy by $391 billion and create 1.8 million new jobs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd we need to focus on mid-band. While the FCC has put the U.S. ahead of many of our global peers when it comes to high-band spectrum, the U.S. lags far behind other countries—including China—in mid-band spectrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMid-band is critical to 5G because it offers high capacity for data-intensive applications as well as the ability to transmit signals over longer distances. By next year, other countries will have released four-times more mid-band spectrum than the United States. With no auctions currently scheduled, we need to move quickly to free up more of this needed spectrum to support our 5G networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the National Spectrum Strategy should recommit to the free-market policies that have made America the proving ground for wireless innovation. In fact, flexible, competition-enhancing policies were key to the U.S. winning the race to 4G and are exactly what we need to reach 5G’s full potential while enhancing our nation’s economic and national security.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThird, the National Spectrum Strategy should articulate a vision for modernizing how the U.S. government approaches spectrum management to both benefit government operations and encourage private sector development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E* * *\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E5G is going to be unlike any other generation of wireless. These networks will transform the way we live and work, powering everything from artificial intelligence, to remote surgery, to precision agriculture, and the innovations of tomorrow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo realize this future and win the race to 5G, we need an action-oriented national strategy to allocating and managing spectrum built on the competitive markets and spectrum policies that made America’s wireless industry the world leader today. And by doubling down on that approach as the 5G race begins in earnest, we’ll be well-positioned to address the coordinated investment strategy that China and other countries are taking.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmerica’s wireless is committed to 5G—and a National Spectrum Strategy is a tremendous opportunity to supercharge the ongoing 5G rollout in the U.S. Let’s make

With no auctions currently scheduled, we need to move quickly to free up more of this needed spectrum to support our 5G networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the National Spectrum Strategy should recommit to the free-market policies that have made America the proving ground for wireless innovation. In fact, flexible, competition-enhancing policies were key to the U.S. winning the race to 4G and are exactly what we need to reach 5G’s full potential while enhancing our nation’s economic and national security.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThird, the National Spectrum Strategy should articulate a vision for modernizing how the U.S. government approaches spectrum management to both benefit government operations and encourage private sector development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E* * *\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E5G is going to be unlike any other generation of wireless.

And by doubling down on that approach as the 5G race begins in earnest, we’ll be well-positioned to address the coordinated investment strategy that China and other countries are taking.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmerica’s wireless is committed to 5G—and a National Spectrum Strategy is a tremendous opportunity to supercharge the ongoing 5G rollout in the U.S. Let’s make

spectrum licenses to the commercial wireless industry has been a win-win for America’s wireless consumers, wireless providers, and in many cases, federal agencies. Auctions have provided speed, certainty, efficiency, and economic rationality to the distribution of spectrum resources.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"Default\"\u003EFor the past fourteen years, innovative legislative tools and funding instruments—like the Spectrum Relocation Fund (SRF)—have supplemented spectrum auctions by enabling federal agencies to more quickly and efficiently relocate their operations from current spectrum to free these frequencies for commercial use. Under this system, relocated federal agencies receive funding from auctions to cover their relocation costs and to explore future research and development. This complementary combination of spectrum auctions and relocation funds has worked well for both federal agencies and commercial stakeholders, allowing for incredible commercial innovation and investment in the wireless ecosystem.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"Default\"\u003EHowever, the current system could be improved in small but important and impactful ways.

China, for instance, has more than 14 wireless cell sites per 10,000 people, compared to 4.7 in the United States, and more than 5 sites per every 10 square miles, compared to 0.4 in the U.S., according to a recent study.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need to keep our foot on the gas—and continue to work together, particularly on spectrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThankfully, the Administration has recognized this and is developing a National Spectrum Strategy to give the wireless industry the certainty required to plan for and build out the best and most secure 5G networks possible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo today we’re laying out a three-point call to action to inform the Administration’s National Spectrum Strategy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we’re calling for a clear, 5-year schedule of new auctions to put more high-, mid-, and low-band spectrum in the hands of America’s wireless industry. Freeing up these spectrum bands will create a spectrum stimulus, boosting the U.S. economy by $391 billion and create 1.8 million new jobs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd we need to focus on mid-band. While the FCC has put the U.S. ahead of many of our global peers when it comes to high-band spectrum, the U.S. lags far behind other countries—including China—in mid-band spectrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMid-band is critical to 5G because it offers high capacity for data-intensive applications as well as the ability to transmit signals over longer distances. By next year, other countries will have released four-times more mid-band spectrum than the United States. With no auctions currently scheduled, we need to move quickly to free up more of this needed spectrum to support our 5G networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the National Spectrum Strategy should recommit to the free-market policies that have made America the proving ground for wireless innovation. In fact, flexible, competition-enhancing policies were key to the U.S. winning the race to 4G and are exactly what we need to reach 5G’s full potential while enhancing our nation’s economic and national security.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThird, the National Spectrum Strategy should articulate a vision for modernizing how the U.S. government approaches spectrum management to both benefit government operations and encourage private sector development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E* * *\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E5G is going to be unlike any other generation of wireless. These networks will transform the way we live and work, powering everything from artificial intelligence, to remote surgery, to precision agriculture, and the innovations of tomorrow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo realize this future and win the race to 5G, we need an action-oriented national strategy to allocating and managing spectrum built on the competitive markets and spectrum policies that made America’s wireless industry the world leader today. And by doubling down on that approach as the 5G race begins in earnest, we’ll be well-positioned to address the coordinated investment strategy that China and other countries are taking.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmerica’s wireless is committed to 5G—and a National Spectrum Strategy is a tremendous opportunity to supercharge the ongoing 5G rollout in the U.S. Let’s make

China, for instance, has more than 14 wireless cell sites per 10,000 people, compared to 4.7 in the United States, and more than 5 sites per every 10 square miles, compared to 0.4 in the U.S., according to a recent study.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need to keep our foot on the gas—and continue to work together, particularly on spectrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThankfully, the Administration has recognized this and is developing a National Spectrum Strategy to give the wireless industry the certainty required to plan for and build out the best and most secure 5G networks possible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo today we’re laying out a three-point call to action to inform the Administration’s National Spectrum Strategy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we’re calling for a clear, 5-year schedule of new auctions to put more high-, mid-, and low-band spectrum in the hands of America’s wireless industry. Freeing up these spectrum bands will create a spectrum stimulus, boosting the U.S. economy by $391 billion and create 1.8 million new jobs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd we need to focus on mid-band. While the FCC has put the U.S. ahead of many of our global peers when it comes to high-band spectrum, the U.S. lags far behind other countries—including China—in mid-band spectrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMid-band is critical to 5G because it offers high capacity for data-intensive applications as well as the ability to transmit signals over longer distances. By next year, other countries will have released four-times more mid-band spectrum than the United States. With no auctions currently scheduled, we need to move quickly to free up more of this needed spectrum to support our 5G networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the National Spectrum Strategy should recommit to the free-market policies that have made America the proving ground for wireless innovation. In fact, flexible, competition-enhancing policies were key to the U.S. winning the race to 4G and are exactly what we need to reach 5G’s full potential while enhancing our nation’s economic and national security.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThird, the National Spectrum Strategy should articulate a vision for modernizing how the U.S. government approaches spectrum management to both benefit government operations and encourage private sector development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E* * *\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E5G is going to be unlike any other generation of wireless. These networks will transform the way we live and work, powering everything from artificial intelligence, to remote surgery, to precision agriculture, and the innovations of tomorrow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo realize this future and win the race to 5G, we need an action-oriented national strategy to allocating and managing spectrum built on the competitive markets and spectrum policies that made America’s wireless industry the world leader today. And by doubling down on that approach as the 5G race begins in earnest, we’ll be well-positioned to address the coordinated investment strategy that China and other countries are taking.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmerica’s wireless is committed to 5G—and a National Spectrum Strategy is a tremendous opportunity to supercharge the ongoing 5G rollout in the U.S. Let’s make it happen,

This new technology will rely on a much wider range of spectrum (from 600 MHz to millimeter wave) than current 4G LTE networks.

more than 800,000 UAVs, otherwise known as drones, are registered in the United States. While hobbyists or recreational users make up the vast majority of drone users today, commercial drone applications promise economic opportunities and broader benefits for consumers and society. In the United States alone, drone commerce is expected to add more than $80 billion to the economy and create more than 100,000 new jobs by 2025.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the U.S. to realize the full potential of drones, policymakers and industry need to work together to craft a regulatory environment that encourages commercial drone deployment. In the coming months, policymakers will address a critical issue: determining how drones will communicate—with each other, with other devices, with their surroundings—and then create standards and processes reflecting this decision.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThankfully, the answer is clear: policymakers should endorse the use of commercial wireless networks for drone communications.

In order to realize this potential, drones need a secure and reliable communications network. This is where wireless networks come in. Powered by licensed spectrum, they provide the coverage, reliability, security, and service quality needed for safe commercial drone applications. The paper, Commercial Wireless Networks: The Essential Foundation of the Drone Industry, can be found \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fctia.it\u002F2mlXA3l\"\u003Ehere\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\r\n\r\nTo discuss the role that wireless networks play, the key steps government needs to take, and the work CTIA is leading in the drone\u002FUAV space, we turned to our drone expert, Jackie McCarthy, Assistant Vice President of Regulatory Affairs:\r\n\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003EQ: How will drones revolutionize American industries? \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\r\n\r\nA: The evolution of drones will impact nearly every industry sector. Everything from consumer package delivery— including the delivery of medications— to search and rescue missions, news reporting (especially in dangerous situations), filmmaking, and even property or infrastructure inspections will benefit from the availability of drones for commercial use.\r\n\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003EQ: Can you update us on CTIA’s work on drones?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\r\n\r\nA: CTIA is focused on educating policymakers on the role of wireless networks in safe and reliable drone operations. We launched our Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Working Group to bring the industry together to advocate for the spectrum and wireless infrastructure policies that will enable drone communications. CTIA partners with all levels of government on developing drone policy and we’re proud to be part of the FAA’s Drone Advisory Committee, the FCC’s Technological Advisory Council, and a close partner of NASA’s on research projects related to low-altitude drone traffic management.\r\n\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003EQ: What is needed from a policy perspective to make commercial drone deployment a reality?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\r\n\r\nA:  Policymakers should take the following steps to create a regulatory environment that ensures the benefits promised by the safe, commercial operation of drones will be realized:\r\n\u003Col\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEndorse commercial wireless networks for UAS communications\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E.

Several countries now have commercial 5G services in place (although limited to certain subscribers, or specific geographical areas initially). As we describe in this report, by 2020 we expect to see around 80 operators in more than 40 countries worldwide having made 5G services available to their subscribers. 5G device availability is expected to expand rapidly in the remained of 2019.

China, for instance, has more than 14 wireless cell sites per 10,000 people, compared to 4.7 in the United States, and more than 5 sites per every 10 square miles, compared to 0.4 in the U.S., according to a recent study.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need to keep our foot on the gas—and continue to work together, particularly on spectrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThankfully, the Administration has recognized this and is developing a National Spectrum Strategy to give the wireless industry the certainty required to plan for and build out the best and most secure 5G networks possible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo today we’re laying out a three-point call to action to inform the Administration’s National Spectrum Strategy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we’re calling for a clear, 5-year schedule of new auctions to put more high-, mid-, and low-band spectrum in the hands of America’s wireless industry. Freeing up these spectrum bands will create a spectrum stimulus, boosting the U.S. economy by $391 billion and create 1.8 million new jobs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd we need to focus on mid-band. While the FCC has put the U.S. ahead of many of our global peers when it comes to high-band spectrum, the U.S. lags far behind other countries—including China—in mid-band spectrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMid-band is critical to 5G because it offers high capacity for data-intensive applications as well as the ability to transmit signals over longer distances. By next year, other countries will have released four-times more mid-band spectrum than the United States. With no auctions currently scheduled, we need to move quickly to free up more of this needed spectrum to support our 5G networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the National Spectrum Strategy should recommit to the free-market policies that have made America the proving ground for wireless innovation. In fact, flexible, competition-enhancing policies were key to the U.S. winning the race to 4G and are exactly what we need to reach 5G’s full potential while enhancing our nation’s economic and national security.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThird, the National Spectrum Strategy should articulate a vision for modernizing how the U.S. government approaches spectrum management to both benefit government operations and encourage private sector development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E* * *\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E5G is going to be unlike any other generation of wireless. These networks will transform the way we live and work, powering everything from artificial intelligence, to remote surgery, to precision agriculture, and the innovations of tomorrow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo realize this future and win the race to 5G, we need an action-oriented national strategy to allocating and managing spectrum built on the competitive markets and spectrum policies that made America’s wireless industry the world leader today. And by doubling down on that approach as the 5G race begins in earnest, we’ll be well-positioned to address the coordinated investment strategy that China and other countries are taking.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmerica’s wireless is committed to 5G—and a National Spectrum Strategy is a tremendous opportunity to supercharge the ongoing 5G rollout in the U.S. Let’s make

Under this system, relocated federal agencies receive funding from auctions to cover their relocation costs and to explore future research and development.

significant leap forward in mobile communications, promising substantial increases in data speed, service quality, and network capacity. This new technology will rely on a much wider range of spectrum than current 4G LTE networks.
