        * Required Legal Disclaimer: Due to recent laws from the FTC, it is required that all companies identify what a "typical" result is.
        The truth is that most people never do anything with the products they buy, so most of the time, they don’t get any results.
        In other words, if you want results you need to take action. The people you see on this web site are examples of our best results
        and are not typical. They followed a healthy lifestyle program including diet, exercise and proper supplementation. In other words,
        they took action. If you want results, you should do this, too.
