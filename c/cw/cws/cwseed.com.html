<p>If you post information or content, such as by posting photos, commenting on a blog, or participating in chat functions or online forums or communities at our Sites, or when you interact with our Sites through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, depending on your privacy settings, this information may become public on the Internet. Therefore, we cannot prevent further use of this information. You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites.

<p><strong>COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNICAL INFORMATION&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cookies and web beacons.</strong> We, and our affiliates, third party service providers, and our business partners may send "cookies" to your computer or use similar technologies to support and enhance your online experience at our Sites, including by helping us collect and understand usage and performance information and to display and measure advertisements. For example, "cookies" are files that can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical information (including click through and click stream data). Cookies manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through us and/or other networks or sites. Cookies can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser).</p>

<p>Some of our Sites may use locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as "Flash cookies") to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation. Adobe's Flash player and similar applications use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. Flash cookies are not managed through your web browser, but you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe's website at <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" class="linkwrap">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html</a>.</p>

<p>We may also use "web beacons" that monitor your use of our Sites. Web beacons (or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When corresponding with you via HTML capable email, web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our email.</p>

<p>On their own, cookies or web beacons generally do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if you choose to furnish personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies/web beacons.</p>

<p><strong>Managing cookies and web beacons and Do Not Track.</strong> By accepting this Privacy Policy, you specifically agree to our use of cookies and web beacons as described herein. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website. Additionally, by setting your web browser to display HTML emails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some web beacons. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. However, certain areas of our Sites can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content or Site features. We do not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.</p>

<p>For more information about cookies and how browser settings can be changed to reject them, you should go to your web browser’s Help menu.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Google Analytics, one of our service providers, provides its own opt-out process. You can find out more information about Google Analytics’ cookies at <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies" class="linkwrap">https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies</a>. You can control the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Sites, by downloading an installing the browser-plug in available at <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.</p>

<p>To set your preferences and opt-out of certain tracking and targeted advertising on your mobile device, follow the device and/or applicable settings on your mobile device.</p>

<p>If you decide not to accept cookies from our Sites or disable certain technologies, you may not be able to take advantage of all of the features of our Sites. &nbsp;</p>
