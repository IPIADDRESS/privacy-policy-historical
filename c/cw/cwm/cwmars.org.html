          <p>The C/W MARS network is a multitype automated library consortium 
            that facilitates efficient resource sharing and rapid access to information 
            for users of its member libraries through the provision of high quality 
            computer and support services.</p>
          <p>C/W MARS provides information services, including access to the Internet, 
            to meet the needs of its member library patrons. The Internet offers 
            a wealth of information that enables libraries to augment library 
            materials. While much of the information on the Internet is professionally 
            and culturally enriching, there may be material that is offensive 
            to some individuals, or that may be illegal. C/W MARS assumes no responsibility 
            for Internet content, including information that may be inaccurate 
            or out-of-date.</p>
          <p>C/W MARS endorses the ALA Library Bill of Rights, its interpretations, 
            and in particular <a href="http://www.ala.org/alaorg/oif/electacc.html" target="_blank">Access 
            to Electronic Information, Services and Networks</a>. C/W MARS does 
            not control or monitor material available on the Internet. Parents 
            and guardians, not the member libraries or their staff, are responsible 
            for information accessed by their children. For those individuals 
            who want more control for themselves or their own children, further 
            information is available on the C/W MARS homepage under <a href="http://www.cwmars.org/links/internet.html#safety">Internet 
            Safety Tips</a>.</p>
          <p>C/W MARS member library patrons and staff must follow the policies 
            of this Network and its Internet Service Provider, the University 
            of Massachusetts University Information Systems. Prohibited use includes:</p>

          <p>Each member library is responsible for informing its patrons of prohibited 
            uses and reporting any violations of this policy to the C/W MARS Executive 
            Director. If the member library believes criminal activity has occurred, 
            the local authorities should also be notified. In the event that any 
            of the prohibited activities occur, C/W MARS may suspend or terminate 
            Internet access to that library until such time that the library implements 
            procedures to stop this activity. Whenever practical, C/W MARS will 
            provide the library advance notice and an opportunity to address the 
            problem.</p>
          <p>C/W MARS does not provide individual e-mail accounts to library users.</p>
          <p>Individual C/W MARS libraries may have local Internet policies that 
            may apply in addition to this policy.</p>
          <p>C/W MARS is committed to the protection of patron privacy in their 
            use of the Internet. See the <a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

            Privacy Policy</font></b></p>
          <p>C/W MARS is committed to the protection of patron privacy. The Network 
            does not require personal information to use the online catalog, electronic 
            databases, or the Internet. C/W MARS keeps no permanent record of 
            the Internet sites visited by library patrons, the electronic databases 
            accessed, or the searches performed by individual patrons. In accordance 
            with Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 78 Section 7: "That part 
            of the records of a public library which reveals the identity and 
            intellectual pursuits of a person using such library shall not be 
            a public record â€¦ " C/W MARS considers circulation and registration 
            records identifying the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of 
            library patrons, as well as the materials borrowed or accessed electronically, 
            not to be part of the public record. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (P.L. 
            107- 56) supercedes state law and expands the federal government's 
            authority for access to library records and documents to protect against 
            international terrorism and clandestine intelligence activities. It 
            also expands federal law enforcements' authorization to track telephone 
            and electronic communication, including any dialing, routing, addressing, 
            or signaling information and the actual content of the communication. 
          </p>
          <p>C/W MARS collects no personal information about users of the Internet, 
            electronic databases, or the online catalog, unless patrons choose 
            to provide it. This information will be used only to enhance the patron's 
            use of the library and the online card catalog. It will not be shared 
            with third parties without the explicit permission of the patron. 
            Library patrons should be aware that C/W MARS and other Massachusetts 
            library organizations license commercial databases from a variety 
            of vendors. The Network will make every effort to restrict electronic 
            database vendors from collecting and using identifying personal information 
            of its library users, however it provides no guarantee that personal 
            information will not be shared with third parties.</p>
          <p>The intellectual pursuits of individuals using library or Internet 
            resources are considered confidential information regardless of the 
            age of the borrower. Such records shall not be made available to any 
            individual or agency except pursuant to such process, order, subpoena 
            or warrant as may be authorized under the authority of, and pursuant 
            to, federal, state, or local law relating to civil, criminal, or administrative 
            discovery procedures or legislative investigative power.</p>
          <p>Upon receipt of such process, order, or subpoena, the Executive Director 
            will notify the C/W MARS Executive Committee, except when prohibited 
            by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and consult with the Network attorney 
            to determine if such process, order, or subpoena is in proper form 
            and if there is evidence of good cause for its issuance. If the process, 
            order, or subpoena is not in proper form or if good cause has not 
            been shown, such defects must be corrected before the information 
            is provided. The Network recognizes that a legal search warrant must 
            be honored immediately, however the library or affected patron(s) 
            may challenge the warrant after the fact.</p>
          <p>Member Library Directors and C/W MARS staff should refer all formal 
            requests for circulation, registration, or usage records to the Executive 
            Director.</p>
          <p>Individual C/W MARS libraries may have local Privacy policies that 
            may apply in addition to this policy. </p>
