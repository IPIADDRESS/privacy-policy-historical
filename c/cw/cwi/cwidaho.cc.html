You can travel through most of this website without providing any information about yourself. On occasion we do request information to provide services that you request, and this commitment of privacy explains our online information practices.
</p>
  <p class="bodytext">CWI does not collect any <em>personal informatio</em>n about you unless you provide that information voluntarily by sending e-mail, completing an online information request form, completing the online application, or completing online registration. </p>
  <p class="bodytext">This policy is consistent with the provisions of the Internet Security and Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Law, and the Personal Privacy Protection Law. </p>
  
  <p class="bodytext"><span class="subheadinline">Information Collected Automatically When You Visit cwidaho.cc</span><br>
        When visiting cwidaho.cc, CWI automatically collects and stores the following information about your visit:</p>
  <ul class="bodytext">
    <li>The Internet Protocol address and Internet Service Provider of the computer that accessed our website
      </li>
    <li>The type of browser, its version and the operating system on which that browser is running      </li>
    <li>The Web page from which the user accessed the current Web page      </li>
    <li>The date and time of the <em>user's</em> request </li>
    <li>The pages that were visited and the amount of time spent at each page </li>
  </ul>
<p class="bodytext">None of the above-mentioned information is deemed to constitute <em>personal information</em> by the Internet Privacy and Security Act. The information that is collected automatically is used to improve cwidaho.cc's content and to help CWI understand how <em>users</em> are interacting with its website. This information is collected for statistical analysis and to determine what information is of most and least interest to our <em>users</em>. The information is not collected for commercial marketing purposes and CWI is not authorized to sell or otherwise disclose the information collected from cwidaho.cc for commercial marketing purposes.</p>
        
        <p class="bodytext"><span class="subheadinline">Information Collected When You E-mail cwidaho.cc or Complete a Transaction</span><br>
      During your visit to cwidaho.cc you may send an e-mail to CWI. Your e-mail address and the contents of your message will be collected. The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats included in the message. Your e-mail address and the information included in your message will be used to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to improve this website, or to forward your message to another CWI department for appropriate action. Your e-mail address is not collected for commercial purposes and CWI is not authorized to sell or otherwise disclose your e-mail address for commercial purposes.
</p>
        <p class="bodytext">During your visit to cwidaho.cc you may complete a transaction such as an online application contribution, survey, or an online information request form. The information collected by CWI, including <em>personal information</em> volunteered by you in completing the transaction, is used by CWI and may be disclosed by CWI for those purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms of the transaction in which the information was submitted.          </p>
        <p class="bodytext">CWI does not knowingly collect <em>personal information</em> from children under the age of 13 or create profiles of children under the age of 13. Users are cautioned, however, that the collection of <em>personal information</em> submitted in an e-mail will be treated as though it was submitted by an adult, and may, unless exempted from access by federal or state law, be subject to public access. </p>
        
        <p class="bodytext"><span class="subheadinline">Disclosure of Information Collected </span><br>
      The collection of information through cwidaho.cc and the disclosure of that information are subject to the provisions of the Internet Security and Privacy Act. CWI will only collect <em>personal information</em> through cwidaho.cc or disclose <em>personal information</em> collected through cwidaho.cc if the user has consented to the collection or disclosure of such <em>personal information</em>. The voluntary disclosure of <em>personal information</em> to CWI by the user, constitutes consent to the collection and disclosure of the information by CWI for the purposes for which the user disclosed the information to CWI. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">However, CWI may collect or disclose <em>personal information</em> without consent if the collection or disclosure is: (1) necessary to perform the statutory duties of CWI, or necessary for CWI to operate a program authorized by law, or authorized by state or federal statute or regulation; (2) made pursuant to a court order or by law; (3) for the purpose of validating the identity of the user; or (4) of information to be used solely for statistical purposes that is in a form that cannot be used to identify any particular person. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">If personal information is requested on the website or volunteered by the user, state law and the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opcl/1974privacyact-overview.htm">federal Privacy Act of 1974</a> may protect it. However, some of the information may become public record once you provide it and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">Further, the disclosure of information, including <em>personal information</em>, collected through cwidaho.cc is subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Law and the Personal Privacy Protection Law. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">CWI may disclose <em>personal information</em> to federal or state law enforcement authorities to enforce its rights against unauthorized access or attempted unauthorized access to CWIâs information technology assets. </p>
        
        <p class="bodytext"><span class="subheadinline">Retention of Information Collected</span><br>
      The information collected through cwidaho.cc is retained by CWI in accordance with the records retention and disposition requirements of the Idaho State Law. In the state of Idaho, laws exist to ensure that government is open and the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve various needs, including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws. In general, the Internet services logs of CWI, comprising electronic files or automated logs created to monitor access and use of College services provided through cwidaho.cc, are archived for future reference.

        <p class="bodytext"><span class="subheadinline"><em>Personal Information</em> and Choice</span><br>
        You may choose whether to provide personal information online.
</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Personal information is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual.

        <p class="bodytext">If personal information is requested on the Web site or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law.          </p>
      <p class="bodytext">If you believe that your personal information is being used for a purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact the communications department as shown in the Contact Information section of this statement. </p>
        
        <p class="bodytext"><span class="subheadinline">Confidentiality and Integrity of <em>Personal Information</em> Collected Through cwidaho.cc</span><br>
        CWI is strongly committed to protecting <em>personal information</em> collected through cwidaho.cc against unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
