NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></strong><span><strong> </strong></span></span><br> <span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Effective January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 requires that, if a business has an established business relationship with a California resident and has within the immediately preceding calendar year shared such resident's personal information with any third party for such third party's direct marketing purposes, then the business must disclose such information-sharing to the resident upon request, including what personal information was shared, and with whom it was shared. However, a business is deemed in compliance with the foregoing if: (1) it has a published privacy policy of not sharing a customer's personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes without the customer's consent (either opt-in or opt-out); and (2) it provides the customer upon request with a notice of his/her choice to prevent such sharing and a cost-free means to exercise that choice. As a general matter, consent by "opt-in" means that a business will not share a customer's personal information with third parties for their direct marketing use, unless the customer affirmatively consents to such sharing (e.g., by checking a box or clicking on a button to manifest consent). On the other hand, consent by "opt-out" means that a business may share a customer's personal information with third parties for their direct marketing use, unless the customer expressly disallows or objects to such sharing (e.g., by checking a box or clicking on a button to manifest disallowance or objection).</span></span><span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span> <span><span style="font-weight: normal;">As a non-profit, we DO NOT knowingly share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing use. California residents may request an information-sharing disclosure from us by emailing your request to

CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</strong></strong></span><br> <span><span style="font-weight: normal;">We reserve the right to modify our Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion. For example, we may amend our Privacy Policy in order to address new developments in federal and state consumer privacy laws, or to conform to changing industry practices. If we make changes to our Privacy Policy, we will announce and post such changes on the Site for the general public. If you are a Member, we may also notify you of the changes via email and may ask you to affirmatively consent to and accept the changes at the time of your next account login on the Site. By continuing to use the Site after such notice and consent, you are bound by our Privacy Policy as modified.</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span> <br> <span><strong><strong>4. INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT ABOUT YOU</strong></strong><span><strong> </strong></span></span><br> <span><span style="font-weight: normal;">(1) Personal Information:</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span> <span><span style="font-weight: normal;">This refers to personally identifiable information about a User, such as first and last name, telephone number, email address, mailing address, birth date, and account login information (i.e., username and password). It also includes information that may be uniquely linked to a User as a result of his/her visit to the Site, such as server log file data and session information (which is explained in more detail in subsection (d) below). Many areas and features on the Site are open to all Users, therefore, you may access them without having to disclose any personal information. However, access to certain areas and features on the Site will require registration, in which case you will be asked to provide certain personal information in order to complete the registration. The following describes the circumstances in which we may collect personal information from and about Users:</span></span><span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br><br></span> <span><span style="font-weight: normal;">(a) Electronic Mailing Lists: We use electronic mailing lists to send news, updates, announcements, newsletters, and other CK-12 communications to Users via email. To join our electronic mailing lists, you will need to provide your email address. You may opt out of our mailing lists at any time. Once you opt out, we will not reuse your email address unless you rejoin our mailing lists or otherwise opt in to receive electronic communications from us (see Section 5 below for further information on opt-out).</span></span><span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span> <span><span style="font-weight: normal;">(b) Survey and Feedback Forms: We may use online survey and feedback forms to gather opinions, comments, suggestions, etc. about the Site from our Users. Survey and feedback forms may be completed and submitted by Users anonymously without disclosing any personal information. However, should you choose to voluntarily disclose personal information to us, we will collect such information.</span></span><span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span> <span><span style="font-weight: normal;">(c) Member Registration and Profile: Certain areas and features on the Site are accessible only to registered Members, such as the FlexBook Platform™. To register as a Member, you must provide certain personal information, such as your full name, email address, and birth date. If you are a minor (but not below the age of 13), we reserve the right to require you to provide the name and email address for your parent or legal guardian. When registering as a Member, you may also, but are not required to, provide general background and biographical information about yourself, such as occupation, professional experience, education, institution/school affiliations, and interests (collectively "Bio"). In addition, you will be asked to choose a username and password for your account login. Your personal information, your Bio and your account login information together will make up your membership profile with CK-12 (the "Profile"). Please note that your Bio and your username will be "public" information, meaning that they will be viewable and accessible by others on the Site. Also, all User Postings made by you will automatically be linked to your username and Bio, so they will be visible to others in connection with your postings. However, your other personal information mentioned above (e.g., first and last name, email address, and birth date) and your login password will be kept private by CK-12 and will not be published or shared with others by CK-12 (subject to limited exceptions specified in Section 4 below). Of course, if you choose to publish or otherwise share with others your personal information (e.g., disclosing your personal information in your User Postings), then others will have access to your personal information. (d) Log Files and Cookies: Our web servers may automatically generate log files that contain data linked to individual Users, such as IP address, browser type, operating system, ISP domain name, referring/exit page, date/time stamp, clickstream data, etc. Also, the Site may use "cookies" to collect session information about individual Users' visits to the Site (see Section 6 below for more information about cookies).</span></span><span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br><br></span> <span><span style="font-weight: normal;">(2) Non-Personal Information:</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span> <span><span style="font-weight: normal;">This refers to any information that does not identify a User personally. For example, we may gather demographic and/or other aggregate data about our Users as a group. Also, we may use online survey and feedback forms to gather opinions, comments, suggestions, etc. about the Site on an anonymous basis from our Users; occasionally, we report quoted feedback from Users, but we do not attribute feedback to individual Users unless we have permission from a User to use his or her name along with the feedback. We collect and use non-personal information to administer and monitor the Site, to analyze Site traffic and usage patterns and trends, to improve the functionality of the Site, and to enable us to personalize and better Users' experience on the Site. When we report information about the Site to our partners and investors, we report non-personal information only.</span></span><span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span> <br> <span><strong><strong>5.

(c) Lastly, if CK-12 is acquired by or merged with or into another entity, or if all or substantially all of our assets are transferred to another entity, your personal information may be transferred to such entity as part of the transaction, and that entity and its affiliates may use your personal information under the terms of their own privacy policies which may differ from this Privacy Policy.</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br><br></span> <span><span style="font-weight: normal;">IN NO EVENT DO WE KNOWINGLY SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHERS FOR THEIR DIRECT MARKETING USE.</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span> <br> <span><strong><strong>6.

Cookies help us deliver content specific to your interests and permit our servers to recall information from your previous visits to the Site. We may use information collected from cookies together with personal information we have collected from you. We do not, however, use cookies to access information on your computer or device. Most Internet browsers allow you to adjust the settings to prevent cookies from being stored on your computer or device.</span></span><br> <br> <span><strong><strong>8. LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</strong></strong></span><span> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span></span><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Site may contain links to certain third-party websites, including the websites of third-party service providers who can help Members print and compile their FlexBook™ textbooks. CK-12 does not own, control or operate such linked sites, and is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of such linked sites.
