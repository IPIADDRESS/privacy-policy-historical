The three levels of the IPSA-T make it possible to assess science achievement at the end of Second Class, the end of Fourth Class and the end of Sixth Class. Using a mixture of Multiple Choice and Short Answer items, pupils just need to tick boxes, circle items and/or write a short sentence to respond to the questions. Information from the IPSA-T can be used to guide teaching and learning in Science at the class or whole school levels and as a basis for reporting pupil progress to parents. Given that the IPSA-T has been trialled with over 2000 pupils in a range of Irish primary schools, teachers can use data on the performance of these pupils as a benchmark for making judgements about how their own pupils did in the tests.The Teacherâs Manual provides directions on how to administer and score the tests. It also includes information on how to interpret the results, a class record sheet and advice about reporting to parents. All Test Booklets use full colour photographs, drawings and illustrations, and are attractively laid out to appeal to pupils in the primary school.">IPSA-T</a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-60"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/mathematics-primary/" title="">Mathematics</a><ul class="children"><li class="cat-item cat-item-63"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/brain-teasers/" title="">Brain Teasers</a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-64"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/figure-it-out/" title="">Figure it Out</a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-67"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/mata-draiochta/" title="">Mata DraÃ­ochta</a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-66"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/math-assessment-tests/" title="">Math Assessment Tests</a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-68"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/mathemagic/" title="What are the main features of Mathemagic?Complete coverage of the Mathematics Curriculum

Competence and understanding are achieved through daily lessons, weekly tests, regular revisions and end-of-year assessments.  As the relevant Table is presented on each page, the activities are self correcting, thereby allowing pupils of all abilities to achieve a high level of correct answers.

The principal purpose of the test is to provide Irish Primary school teachers with accurate information on the reading levels of pupils in their classes. In particular, the tests enable teachers to compare the reading performances of their pupils with reading standards nationally.The MICRA-T was first developed in 1988 under the aegis of the Curriculum Development Unit, Mary Immaculate College, Limerick. The entire series of tests was redeveloped during 2001 and 2002. The revised tests retain most of the successful features of the original tests while also incorporating numerous improvements. The redeveloped tests were standardised on a nationally representative sample of more than 10,000 pupils during the 2002-2003 school year, thus providing up-to-date norms.The range of usage for each level is as follows:Level 1 - First Class
Level 2 - Second &amp; Third Class
Level 3 - Fourth Class
Level 4 - Fifth &amp; Sixth ClassA key strength of the tests is that they have been carefully constructed to ensure that their difficulty levels are suitable for children of all reading abilities - from the least able to the most able.Distinguished by their attractive layout and high colour content, the tests are visually appealing to pupils, a factor that is important in securing pupil interest. The tests have been available to schools since mid-January 2004 and can only be obtained from the publisher, CJ Fallon.The tests are accompanied by four Teacherâs Manuals, scoring stencils and a computerised scoring system, developed by Helen Woods (Version 2.10 now available). For more information on this CD please visit www.micra-t.ie.">MICRA-T</a><ul class="children"><li class="cat-item cat-item-22"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/level-1/" title="Level 1 (First Class) of the test consists of 50 items. The items are grouped into three subtests which collectively provide a balanced assessment of children's emergent reading ability and allow for the early identification of reading difficulties. Part A contains 20 items, designed to assess the word recognition skills of First Class pupils. Part B is made up of 12 sets of nonsense words which are intended to tap children's phonological awareness and decoding ability. Phonological awareness is an important skill domain that has been given particular emphasis in the English area of the revised Primary School Curriculum. Crucially, skill at decoding nonsense words has been shown to be an excellent predictor of later reading ability. The final section, Part C, is composed of 18 items which assess pupils' reading comprehension.
The entire 50-item test, as well as practice items for Part C, can be easily administered by teachers in less than one hour.
Although not specifically developed for use with Senior Infants, Level 1 can nonetheless be used during the final term of Senior Infants in classes where the pupils are of average or above average ability.">Level 1</a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-23"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/level-2/" title="There are three parts to Level 2 (Second &amp; Third Class) of the test. The first part of the test, containing 20 items, assesses pupils' word recognition and decoding skills. This is followed by two comprehension sections, the first of which requires pupils to demonstrate their understanding of individual sentences by responding in a variety of ways. The second comprehension section consists of 36 sentences, graded according to difficulty, with each sentence containing a superfluous word which must be deleted in order to render the sentence meaningful.
While this level of the test is highly similar to the original Level 2, the difficulty level has been extended upwards so that it remains challenging even at the end of Third Class.Total administration time, including sample items for each part, is approximately one hour.
Scoring of the test booklets is facilitated by the use of the scoring templates which are provided with the test manual.">Level 2</a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-24"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/level-3/" title="Level 3 (Fourth Class), developed for use with Fourth Class pupils, consists of four cloze passages. The passages are graded in difficulty and length. The first passage is based upon two virtually identical pictures and requires pupils to identify the differences between the passages in order to supply the correct responses. The 'puzzle-like' element of the passage is designed to generate interest and a positive attitude on the part of pupils at the outset of the test.
As with other levels of the test, parallel forms have been developed. Because the test shares the same practice passage with Level 4, the administration instructions for the two levels are almost identical. This means that both levels can be simultaneously administered in multigrade classes.There are 64 items in the test and the total administration time slightly exceeds one hour. Scoring stencils accompany the test manual in order to expedite scoring of the test booklets.">Level 3</a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-25"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/level-4/" title=" The former Level 3 of the test now becomes Level 4 (Fifth &amp; Sixth Class). The test continues to have five passages and retains the cloze procedure format which provides an excellent means of assessing reading comprehension. However, the test has been improved by the replacement of the initial passage with a new passage in each of the parallel forms. Consequently, the introductory passage is now easier, giving weaker pupils a better opportunity to perform on the test.
Although the test has not been lengthened, the time allowed for completing the test has been extended from 35 to 50 minutes. This is to reduce the role played by time-management in how well pupils perform.">Level 4</a></li></ul></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-88"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/music/" title="View all posts filed under Music">Music</a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-45"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/religious-education/" title="My First Communion and Penance â Jesus is my special friend provides a fresh approach in preparing children to receive the Sacraments of First Penance and Holy Communion.

The five levels within the series are based on main strands of the Primary School Mathematics Curriculum and the content of the tests has been fully aligned with the mathematics programme.SIGMA-T 'as Gaeilge'The SIGMA-T Tests are also available 'as Gaeilge' and the 'AN TRIAIL A RITH' units from the Teacher's Manuals are available to download from 'my.cjfallon.ie'.The tests are intended to provide teachers with accurate and reliable information on the mathematical achievement of pupils. This information can significantly assist teachers in monitoring pupil progress and in identifying pupils with learning difficulties in mathematics. The information gained from the test is also intended to help teachers in reporting to parents on the progress of individual pupils.The range of usage for each level is as follows:Level 1 : Beginning of 1st Class â End of first term in 2nd Class
Level 2 : Last term in 2nd Class â End of first term in 3rd Class
Level 3 : Last term in 3rd Class â End of first term in 4th Class
Level 4 : Last term in 4th Class â End of first term in 5th Class
Level 5 : Last term in 5th Class â End of 6th ClassThe tests may be administered during the first or last term of each school year and separate scoring norms are provided for each period. Levels 1 and 5 may also be administered in mid-year.At each level of the test, there are parallel forms to minimise copying and to allow for repeat testing.The tests have been standardised using a nationally representative sample of more than 13,000 pupils. Because the tests are norm-referenced, they enable teachers to compare the performance of each pupil taking the test with the standards of other pupils at the same class level nationally.The test results can also be analysed to provide teachers with detailed diagnostic information on each pupil. A separate CD is available which will greatly facilitate the processing of this information and will enhance the storage and management of test data.The difficulty levels of tests have been carefully graded to ensure that they are suitable for pupils of varying ability levels.Distinguished by their attractive layout and high colour content, the tests are visually appealing to pupils, a factor that is important in securing pupil interest.The current series of tests was published in 2007. The tests, together with the associated manuals, scoring stencils and scoring CD, are available only to teachers and can be obtained directly from the publisher, CJ Fallon.The test manuals contain clear information on administering and scoring the tests, guidance on interpreting the results, and advice on reporting the results to parents.">SIGMA-T</a><ul class="children"><li class="cat-item cat-item-26"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/level-1-sigma-t/" title=" Level 1 of the SIGMA-T consists of 46 items. The test can be used at any stage from the beginning of 1st Class until the end of the first term in 2nd Class. In order to cater for the wide ability range of pupils, the test content is drawn from the five main strands of the mathematics curriculum for Junior Infants, Senior Infants, 1st Class and the beginning of 2nd Class.Only the first 34 items in the test are administered to pupils at the beginning of 1st Class due to the earlier stage of development of pupils at this stage.Level 1 of the test is administered item-by-item by the teacher. The test is untimed and total administration time will vary from class to class, depending upon the ability levels of the pupils being tested. In general, testing will take between 50 and 70 minutes to complete.
All pupils in national schools must be tested on a standardised mathematics test either at the end of 1st Class or the beginning of 2nd Class. Level 1 of the SIGMA-T is designed to enable schools to fulfil this requirement.">Level 1</a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-27"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/level-2-sigma-t/" title="There are 57 separate items in Level 2 of the SIGMA-T.&nbsp; A number of the items have sub-parts so that, for scoring purposes, the test contains a total of 64 items.
The test can be used at either the end of 2nd Class or at the beginning of 3rd Class. The test provides a comprehensive assessment of pupilsâ knowledge of the mathematics learning objectives in the Primary School Curriculum for these classes.
In order to take account of the wide ability range of pupils, the test content is drawn from the five main strands of the mathematics curriculum for Senior Infants, 1st Class, 2nd Class and the beginning of 3rd Class.
The test is untimed so that the time taken to administer it will partly depend on the ability levels of pupils in any particular class. The early items in the test are administered item-by-item by the teacher. Pupils then complete the remaining part of the test independently. Typically, the time taken to administer the test will range from 50 minutes to 75 minutes.">Level 2</a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-28"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/level-3-sigma-t/" title=" Level 3 of the test may be administered to pupils who are in the final term of 3rd Class or who are in the first term of 4th Class.
The five key strands of the mathematics curriculum are assessed through 55 separate items. Several of the items have more than a single part so that in total there are 68 scorable items.
The test content is mainly drawn from the mathematics curriculum for 3rd Class and the beginning of 4th Class. However, some material from earlier class levels is included in order to cater for weaker pupils who are taking the test.
The test is easily administered by following the straightforward instructions in the accompanying test manual. The test proper is preceded by a small number of practice items, following which pupils complete the test independently. Although there is no time limit for completion, the typical administration time ranges from 50 to 75 minutes.
In multigrade classrooms, Level 3 may be administered concurrently with other levels of the test.">Level 3</a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-29"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/level-4-sigma-t/" title=" Level 4 of the test was developed for use with pupils who are approaching the end of 4th Class or who are in the first term in 5th Class.
The test consists of two distinct parts which should be administered on different occasions. The test booklet for Part 1 contains 52 items whereas Part 2 is comprised of 22 word problems. A number of the items in Part 1 have multiple parts so that in total, there are 81 scorable items. Separate scores can be computed for the two parts of the test as well as an overall test score.
There are no time limits for the completion of either part of the test. In most classroom situations, Part 1 can be completed within roughly an hour. Part 2 takes a similar amount of time to administer.
In multigrade classrooms, Level 4 may be administered concurrently with other levels of the test.
All pupils in national schools must be tested on a standardised mathematics test either when they are at the end of 4th Class or at the beginning of 5th Class. This level of the SIGMA-T is designed to facilitate schools in fulfilling this requirement.">Level 4</a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-30"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/level-5/" title="There are two parts to Level 5 of the SIGMA-T. The first part is composed of 66 items which assess pupilsâ knowledge of mathematical facts and concepts as well as their ability to perform a wide range of mathematical procedures. The second part of the test, which is administered separately, consists of 28 word problems of varying degrees of difficulty. Several of the items in the test have multiple parts so that in total the number of items in the test is 119.
Collectively, the test items provide a broad and comprehensive assessment of pupilsâ mathematical achievement in the areas of number, measurement, geometry, elementary algebra, and data and statistics.
The test can be administered to pupils at any stage from the end of 5th Class until the end of 6th Class. Separate norms are available for each of the four terms. The test content is largely based on the mathematics curriculum for 5th and 6th Classes although material is also included from lower grades in order to make the test suitable for use with weaker pupils. The sequence of test items has been carefully graded according to the difficulty levels of the items.
Both parts of the test are untimed so that the administration time partly depends on the ability levels of the pupils taking the test. Whereas more able pupils may complete Part 1 within 45 minutes, some pupils may take somewhat more than an hour to do so. Administration time for Part 2 is typically between 45 minutes and an hour.
Separate scores can be computed for the two parts of the test as well as an overall test score. The test manual contains detailed guidelines for administering and scoring the test. It provides clear guidance on interpreting and analysing pupilsâ results and offers advice on reporting test results to parents.">Level 5</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-10"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/primary-abc/" title="View all posts filed under Primary ABC">Primary ABC</a><ul class="children"><li class="cat-item cat-item-41"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/education-matters-yearbook/" title="">Education Matters Yearbook</a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-39"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/practical-guide-books/" title="">Practical Guide Books</a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-38"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/the-essential-guide-books/" title="">The Essential Guide Books</a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-40"><a href="http://www.cjfallon.ie/books/zoo-books-early-readers/" title="">Zoo Books (Early Readers)</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></li><li id="login"><h2><span class="ribbon"></span><span class="bottom"></span>MyCJFallon</h2><div class="content"><p class="login">Login to your account</p><form action="http://my.cjfallon.ie/login" method="post"> <input type="text" name="username" value="Username" onblur="if (this.value=='') this.value = this.defaultValue" onfocus="if (this.value==this.defaultValue) this.value = ''"> <input type="password" name="password" value="Password" onblur="if (this.value=='') this.value = this.defaultValue" onfocus="if (this.value==this.defaultValue) this.value = ''"> <input type="submit" value="Login" class="submit"></form><hr><div class="register"><p>Don't have an account?</p><p><a href="http://my.cjfallon.ie/login/register">Register here</a></p><p><a href="http://my.cjfallon.ie/login/forgotpassword" class="fpassword" title="Forgot Password">Forgot Password</a></p></div></div></li></ul><div id="main"><h1>Online Privacy Policy</h1><p>This privacy statement is provided by C J Fallon Limited (referred to as âusâ, âourâ, or âweâ in these terms) for the information of visitors (referred to as âyouâ or âyourâ in these terms) to our website.</p><p>C J Fallon Limited is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected.
