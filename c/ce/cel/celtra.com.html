<p><b>“Non-Personal Data”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means information not included in the definition of Personal Data, such as pages or ads visited, time spent on pages, browser and device type, and referring and exit pages. For non-residents of the European Economic Area, IP address and advertising IDs (IDFA/AAID) are Non-Personal Data.</span></p>
<h2 id="information-we-collect">1. Information We Collect/Receive and How We Use that Information</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, there are three categories of information we collect: </span><b>(1)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> information that we can use to provide additional features and improved experiences if you choose to share that information; </span><b>(2)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> information that we must have for you to use the Celtra Services; and </span><b>(3)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> information collected from your interaction with the Celtra Services as an End User of a digital advertisement (hereinafter referred to as “ad” or “ads”).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you provide Personal Data directly to us, this information is used by Celtra solely for the purposes identified at the point you provide it. Information we collect may be transferred, stored, used, and/or processed as follows:</span></p>
<p><b>I. Contact Information</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you contact us through the “Contact Us” page on the Website or become a Platform User of the Celtra Services, you will be asked to provide us with certain Personal Data about yourself which may include your name, email address, job title, name of your organization, mailing address, or telephone number.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consistent with any permissions you may have communicated to us, we may use this information to directly communicate with you for marketing and promotional purposes via emails, notifications, or other messages, and to communicate with you for research purposes including via emails, notifications, or other messages. Platform Users may also receive communications concerning Celtra product updates, training sessions, or events or webinars. If you want to stop receiving such materials from Celtra, you can change your profile settings within the Celtra Services or follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.</span></p>
<p><b>II. Billing Information</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In certain circumstances, to use the Celtra Services, you may be required to provide additional information which may include a credit card number, expiration date, billing zip code, activation code, and similar information (“Billing Information”).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celtra uses this information to process payments. In certain circumstances, Celtra uses third-party service providers to manage credit card processing. These service providers are not permitted to store, retain, or use Billing Information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.</span></p>
<p><b>III.</b> <b>User Activity Data</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In an ongoing effort to improve the Website and the Celtra Services, we automatically collect certain information when Visitors visit the Website and when Platform Users use the Celtra Services (collectively, the “User Activity Data”).

<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to request access to, or ask us to provide you with copies of, Personal Data that we hold about you at any time, which may be subject to a fee specified by law for processing your request (but not for making a request for access). If Celtra is the Data Controller with respect to your data, we will respond to your request within a reasonable period, and if Celtra is the Data Processor with respect to your data, we may redirect your request to Celtra’s customer acting as the Data Controller with respect to your data. We may decline a request for access to Personal Data in circumstances prescribed by relevant privacy laws. If we decline a request, we will provide you with a written notice that sets out the reasons for the refusal (unless it would be unreasonable to provide those reasons) and provide you with a statement regarding the mechanisms available to you to make a complaint;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to ask us to delete any Personal Data that we hold about you free of charge, unless we are required to maintain a copy of this data pursuant to applicable law;</span></li>
<li>The right to ask us to update and correct any out-of-date or incorrect or inaccurate Personal Data that we hold about you free of charge. We will take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete and up to date.

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to opt out of any marketing communications that we (or any third-party to whom we have disclosed your Personal Data with your consent) may send you or to withdraw your prior consent or object to any further processing of your Personal Data;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to request information about any automated decisions made using your Personal Data that have legal consequences for you or which significantly affect you; and</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to lodge a complaint with your local Data Protection Authority concerning Celtra’s processing of your Personal Data.</span></li>
</ol>
