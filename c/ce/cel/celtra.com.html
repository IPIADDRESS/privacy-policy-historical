This includes IP address and advertising ID (IDFA/AAID).</span></p>
<p><b>“Non-Personal Data”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means information not included in the definition of Personal Data, such as pages or ads visited, time spent on pages, browser and device type, and referring and exit pages. For non-residents of the European Economic Area, IP address and advertising IDs (IDFA/AAID) are Non-Personal Data.</span></p>
<h2>1. Information We Collect/Receive and How We Use that Information</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, there are three categories of information we collect: </span><b>(1)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> information that we can use to provide additional features and improved experiences if you choose to share that information; </span><b>(2)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> information that we must have for you to use the Celtra Services; and </span><b>(3)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> information collected from your interaction with the Celtra Services as an End User of a digital advertisement (hereinafter referred to as “ad” or “ads”).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you provide Personal Data directly to us, this information is used by Celtra solely for the purposes identified at the point you provide it. Information we collect may be transferred, stored, used, and/or processed as follows:</span></p>
<p><b>I. Contact Information</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you contact us through the “Contact Us” page on the Website or become a Platform User of the Celtra Services, you will be asked to provide us with certain Personal Data about yourself which may include your name, email address, job title, name of your organization, mailing address, or telephone number.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consistent with any permissions you may have communicated to us, we may use this information to directly communicate with you for marketing and promotional purposes via emails, notifications, or other messages, and to communicate with you for research purposes including via emails, notifications, or other messages. Platform Users may also receive communications concerning Celtra product updates, training sessions, or events or webinars. If you want to stop receiving such materials from Celtra, you can change your profile settings within the Celtra Services or follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.</span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celtra uses this information to process payments. In certain circumstances, Celtra uses third-party service providers to manage credit card processing. These service providers are not permitted to store, retain, or use Billing Information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.</span></p>
<p><b>III.</b> <b>User Activity Data</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In an ongoing effort to improve the Website and the Celtra Services, we automatically collect certain information when Visitors visit the Website and when Platform Users use the Celtra Services (collectively, the “User Activity Data”). This information may include IP address, browser and device type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spend on pages, what sections of the Website Visitors visit, and other, similar aggregate user data concerning your use of the Website and the Celtra Services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may use this data to manage and improve your experience using the Website and the Celtra Services. In some areas of the world, certain User Activity Data may be Personal Data. Where this is the case, we comply with applicable laws regarding our use and processing of Personal Data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>IV. Ad Interaction Data</b>. When End Users interact with ads generated using the Celtra Services, we may collect information on behalf of Celtra’s customers which may be the advertiser, publisher, advertising agency, and/or their agents. Data collected through interaction with the Celtra Services may include time spent viewing an ad, page views, video views, number of ads clicked, IP address, device ID, GPS coordinates, advertising identifiers (IDFA/AAID), Personal Data that you affirmatively elect to share with us through text field forms, and other information about your interaction with the ads (“Ad Interaction Data”).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With respect to End User data, Celtra is acting as a “Data Processor” on behalf of our customers, which may include the advertiser, publisher, and/or their agents who are the Data Controller of your data who may use this information for their lawful advertising purposes to provide you with a more tailored online advertising experience. We may also use the information internally to improve the functionality of the Celtra Services.</span></p>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to request information about any automated decisions made using your Personal Data that have legal consequences for you or which significantly affect you; and</span></li>
