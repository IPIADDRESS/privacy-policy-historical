			<h2 align="justify"><font size="3">What Information 
			We Collect and How We Use It</font></h2>
			<h3 align="justify"><font size="3">Personally 
			Identifiable Information</font></h3>
			<p align="justify">When you place an 
			order for products or services we collect certain types of 
			personally identifiable information required to fulfill those 
			products or services, including (1) contact information, such as 
			name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number; (2) payment 
			information, such as credit card number, or (3) ID verification 
			information, such as credit card number, date of birth, Social 
			Security Number, or Driver's License Number, as may be required by a 
			wireless carrier if you are requesting a new account.</p>
			<p align="justify">We use this 
			information to process requests for products and services. For those 
			customers applying for new wireless service activation, this 
			includes performing a standard industry credit check by inputting 
			your data into the wireless carrier's system. Once the carrier runs 
			the check, it informs us of an applicant's approval status so that 
			we can either process the order or notify those applicants who have 
			not been approved of their status. Aside from approval status 
			information, we do not have access to an applicant's credit-history 
			information.</p>
			<p align="justify">We also use 
			collected information to communicate with you, such as to notify you 
			about updates to products, to send you order confirmations, or to 
			provide you with important product warranty or safety information. 
			Your e-mail address may also be sent a third party newsletter from 
			WireOffers.com. You can easily opt out of this newsletter by 
			visiting wireoffers.com or by clicking the unsubscribe link at the 
			bottom of any of these e-mails. In addition, we use contact 
			information you provide to respond to your inquiries about our 
			offerings, and to offer you, by means of e-mail or through our 
			newsletter, additional products, programs or services that we 
			believe may be of interest to you. </p>
			<p align="justify">Information from IP 
			addresses is used for system administration, to examine overall 
			traffic trends, troubleshooting, etc. This information is used only 
			in the aggregate form. IP addresses are not linked to any personally 
			identifiable information, meaning the user session is tracked, but 
			the user is anonymous. </p>
			<h3 align="justify"><font size="3">Supplementation of 
			Information </font></h3>
			<p align="justify">We may, from time 
			to time, supplement the information we collect online with outside 
			records (e.g., information from our Strategic Partners or from 
			wireless providers) to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor 
			our content to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase 
			products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.
			</p>
			<h3 align="justify"><font size="3">Sharing of Your 
			Information </font></h3>
			<p align="justify">Agents and 
			contractors who have access to personally identifiable information 
			are required to protect it in a manner that is consistent with this 
			Privacy Notice.</p>
			<p align="justify">To fulfill your 
			requests for products and services, we may need to share some of 
			your personally identifiable information with both the wireless 
			provider from which you would like to request service and the 
			"Strategic Partner” through which you accessed Cell Phone Digest - 
			cellstores, or with other affiliates or co-branding partners.</p>
			<p align="justify">More specifically, 
			when you place an order for wireless services, we will share names, 
			contact information, and other information that is necessary for the 
			wireless carrier to provide you with its services, and to provide 
			you with products that we think you will find interesting. The 
			provider may use this information for credit approval, service 
			activation, and from time to time, for its own marketing purposes. 
			You should consult the wireless providers' respective privacy 
			policies, as this Notice does not cover their use of your 
			information. </p>
			<p align="justify">In addition, if you 
			access Cell Phone Digest - cellstores through a third-party site, such 
			as one of our Strategic Partners' sites, we also may need to report 
			certain personally identifiable information (e.g., name and e-mail 
			address) back to that Web site. As we explain further below in the 
			section that follows, we will tell you at the point of collection if 
			we will share personally identifiable information with the Strategic 
			Partner through which you access the Cell Phone Digest - cellstores 
			service. </p>
			<p align="justify">In addition, we may 
			share aggregated demographic information with our Strategic 
			Partners, wireless providers and advertisers.</p>
			<h3 align="justify"><font size="3">Sharing of 
			Affiliate Information in the Affiliate Sign-Up Process </font></h3>
			<p align="justify">Information 
			submitted by potential Affiliates in the Affiliate Sign-Up Process 
			is submitted to Linkshare. Linkshare's privacy policy can be found 
			here: www.linkshare.com.</p>
			<h3 align="justify"><font size="3">Our Collection of 
			Personally Identifiable Information Through a Third-party Web Site</font></h3>
			<p align="justify">To provide you with 
			content and service, we have relationships with many of the best 
			service and content companies. As a result of these relationships, 
			you can access Cell Phone Digest - cellstores through a third-party 
			Web site. You can recognize most of the Cell Phone Digest - cellstores 
			pages on these third-party sites by looking for the joint branding 
			of Cell Phone Digest - cellstores and a third-party company. For 
			example, if you see a logo on the page that says "Powered by Cell 
			Phone Digest - cellstores," you are on a co-branded page.</p>
			<p align="justify">Whenever you 
			provide registration information on a co-branded page, that data may 
			be shared with the third-party site through which you access Cell 
			Phone Digest - cellstores. We may share personally identifiable 
			information with third parties. By agreeing to this privacy policy, 
			you give us permission to transfer your personal information to 
			third parties for the purposes of analyzing it to make your 
			experience better and offering products to you. We encourage you to 
			read the privacy policies of such third parties, as this Notice does 
			not cover their use of information.</p>
			<h3 align="justify"><font size="3">Third Party 
			Sharing of Information</font></h3>
			<p align="justify">Cell Phone Digest - 
			cellstores sometimes may offer content (e.g., promotions, 
			affiliations, sponsorships) that is sponsored by or cobranded with 
			identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the 
			third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that 
			visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity.</p>
			<h3 align="justify"><font size="3">Live Help Function</font></h3>
			<p align="justify">To better serve you 
			and respond to your questions regarding our products or services, we 
			also maintain a Live Help function through which we can respond, in 
			real time, to your questions about our products and services. This 
			information enables us to understand the types of questions our 
			users have about our products and services so that we may continue 
			to improve our content and offerings. </p>
			<h3 align="justify"><font size="3">Non-Personally 
			Identifiable Information </font></h3>
			<p align="justify">We may collect 
			certain non-personally identifiable information about our visitors 
			when you visit many of our Web pages such as the type of browser you 
			are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating 
			system you are using, (e.g., Windows '98 or Mac OS) and the domain 
			name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, 
			Earthlink).</p>
			<p align="justify">We use the 
			non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve 
			the design and content of our service pages and to enable us to 
			personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this 
			information in the aggregate to analyze service usage. </p>
			<h3 align="justify"><font size="3">Legal 
			Process/Disclaimer </font></h3>
			<p align="justify">We may disclose 
			personally identifiable information in response to legal process or 
			when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, 
			in response to a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency's 
			request. </p>
			<h2 align="justify"><font size="3">Choices/Opt Out</font></h2>
			<p align="justify">If you prefer not 
			to receive marketing information, including emails from us, or wish 
			to fully deactivate your account information from us, simply let us 
			know by sending a letter via certified mail to Cell Phone Digest - 
			cellstores, Inc., 1010 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 600, Washington, DC 
			20007 or an e-mail to Customer Relations or by visiting 
			www.WireOffers.com. Please note that even if you chose to opt out of 
			Cell Phone Digest - cellstores's marketing, we will continue to send 
			you important service-related communications (e.g., order 
			confirmation or product safety information). However, these are not 
			promotional in nature.</p>
			<h3 align="justify"><font size="3">Cookies</font></h3>
			<p align="justify">To enhance your 
			experience with our site, we use "cookies." Cookies are used by your 
			computer's browser to store your preferences. We use both session 
			and persistent cookies. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your 
			e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless 
			you choose to provide this information to us by, for example,

			<h3 align="justify"><font size="3">Tracking Pixels</font></h3>

			site contains links to other Web sites whose information practices 
			may be different than ours. Our privacy policy does not cover these
