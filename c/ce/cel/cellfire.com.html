For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of our combining such information. </p> <p> <strong>Mobile device identification information.</strong> When you connect to the Service on your internet-enabled mobile device, if your service provider uniquely identifies the device, Cellfire will receive this information.

Certain Cellfire services may require our collection from you of the phone number for your device. Additionally, through the use of your mobile phone, we may collect your phone number and/or name. We may associate that information to the mobile device identification information and to other information we have collected from and about you; however we will not use that number for telemarketing. </p> <p> <strong>Mobile device physical location.</strong> Some mobile phone service providers are required to operate a system that will pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on the provider, Cellfire may automatically receive this information. </p> <p> <strong>Usage information.</strong> As part of the standard operation of the Service, we may collect certain non-personal information from you. For example, when you use the Service, your mobile phone automatically records and sends basic information about your use to Cellfire.
