                <p><strong>Last updated: November 30, 2015</strong></p>
<p>Your privacy is something we take seriously. Here at The Informr (ten24 Media Inc.) we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<p>- We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. <em>(We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason)</em></p>
<p>- We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</p>
<p>- We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services. Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals.</p>
<h3>In Short</h3>
<p>We collect anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of our pages you viewed. If you use some 3rd party services like Google or Facebook, they may know you visited this website. We can’t control how they use this data but we don’t believe this knowledge poses any threat to you.</p>
<p>If you sign up with us we take great care to keep your information safe and we’ll never share it with others without your express permission.</p>
<p>We never share your data with 3rd parties except to help us deliver our own services.</p>
<p>These are just the key points. If you need detail, keep reading.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, ten24 Media Inc. collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ten24 Media Inc.'s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use our websites. From time to time, ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its websites.</p>
<p>ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our websites (ie. theinformr.com). ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to ten24 Media Inc.'s websites choose to interact with the sites in ways that require ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a user account to provide a username and email address. ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with the site. ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h3>Measuring our Visitors / Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;may collect statistics about the behaviour of visitors to its websites. and may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<p>We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous – so we don’t know who you are; just that somebody visited our site.</p>
<p>The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better.</p>
<p>You can learn more about Google Analytics or opt out if you wish.</p>
<h3>Facebook, Twitter and other social networks</h3>
<p>We may use services such as social buttons. To do so we embed code from a third-party that they provide and we do not control ourselves. To function their buttons generally know if you’re logged in; for example Facebook use this to say “x of your friends like this”. We do not have any access to that information, nor can we control how those networks use it. We suggest you check the third party websites for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.</p>
<h3>Emails</h3>
<p>We may send you email notifications regarding your account or for other communications you have specifically requested (such as newsletters or notifications when someone replies to one of your comments). You have the ability to opt out of any of this communication at any time.</p>
<p>We will never provide your personal information or email address to any third parties except where they are specifically employed to help deliver our own services, as detailed above.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ten24 Media Inc.'s behalf or to provide services available at ten24 Media Inc.'s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using ten24 Media Inc.'s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ten24 Media Inc., third parties or the public at large.</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of an ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;website and have supplied your email address, ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>

<p><strong>We use cookies to help identify and track visitors, their usage of our websites, their website access preferences and&nbsp;the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and our website.</strong></p>
<p>Visiting our websites with your browser settings adjusted to accept cookies tells us that you want to use our products and services and that you consent to our use of cookies and other technologies to provide them to you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Website visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using ten24 Media Inc.'s websites, with the drawback that certain features of ten24 Media Inc.'s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<p>Each browser is different, so check the 'Help' menu of your particular browser (or your mobile phone's handset manual) to learn how to change your cookie preferences.</p>
<h3>Ads</h3>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.</p>
<p>This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by ten24 Media Inc.&nbsp;and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<h3>Additional Policy Information</h3>

These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.</p>
<p>Our websites offer publicly accessible reviews, comments or community forums (questions/answers). You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.</p>
