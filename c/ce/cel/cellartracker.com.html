<p><b>Last Changes to Privacy Policy: October 25, 2012</b></p>
<p>We are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information.&nbsp; The policies
below are applicable to the cellartracker.com website (“Website”) produced and
maintained by CellarTracker! LLC (collectively “CellarTracker” or “we”, “us”,
or “our”). We have established this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to let
you know the kinds of personal information we may gather during your visit to
the Website, why we gather your information, what we use your personal
information for, when we might disclose your personal information, and how you
can manage your personal information.</p>

<p>Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy apply only to
information gathered online at our Website. This Privacy Policy does not apply
to information that you may submit to us offline, or to websites maintained by
other companies or organizations to which we may link.</p>

<p><b>By visiting our Website, you are accepting the practices described in our Privacy Policy.&nbsp; If
you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the
Website.&nbsp; We reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of our Privacy
Policy from time to time without notice. Your continued use of our Website and
our affiliate sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean
you accept those changes.&nbsp; If we intend to apply the modifications or
amendments to this Privacy Policy retroactively, we will provide you with
notice of the modifications or amendments.</b></p>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or don’t see your concerns addressed here,
you should contact us by email at <a href="mailto:editors@cellartracker.com">editors@cellartracker.com</a>.</p>

<h3>What Information About Me Is Collected and Stored?</h3>

<p>CellarTracker adheres to the highest standards of ethical practices in all of our operations and is
dedicated to protecting the privacy of all visitors to our Website.&nbsp; <b>Our
privacy policy is simple: Except as disclosed below, we don't sell, barter,
give away, or rent your personal information to any company outside of CellarTracker.</b></p>

<h3>Personal Information</h3>

<p>We collect personally
identifiable information from you when you register to use the Website, when
you submit contributions or tasting notes, when you participate in any forums,
when you make voluntary payment to CellarTracker, or when you request customer
support or send us e-mail (“Submissions”).&nbsp; If you submit Submissions or
information, we collect identifiable information about you and your authorized
users such as your name, user ID, and email address and may collect telephone
numbers, billing information, and demographic information such as age, gender
and zip code (“Personal Information”). We also collect and store information that you enter into this Website or that you
provide to any of our representatives, or in conjunction with requests for more
information.&nbsp;Registration may also be required and
Personal Information may also be collected if there are certain portions of the
Website in which you specifically and knowingly provide such information, e.g.
community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards, blog comments, if any).&nbsp; We
also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other
sources such as 3rd party wine reviewers that you subscribe to, to
enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database.
Generally speaking, your personal information is never exposed on the website,
but if you register on the Forum or on the website, you have control over your
profile and what information is shown. Likewise, tasting notes are shown
publicly in association with the handle specified in your profile. You can see
more information about your settings at
<a href="http://www.cellartracker.com/privacy.asp">www.cellartracker.com/privacy.asp</a>.</p>

<h3>Anonymous Information</h3>

<p>In addition, when you interact with the Website, our servers may keep an activity log that does not
identify you individually (“Anonymous Information”). Generally, this information
is collected through “traffic data”. We collect and store certain
administrative and traffic information with each use of the service or Website
including: source IP address, time of access, date of access, web page(s),
software crash reports, type of browser used, session identification number,
search terms, search results, access times and referring websites addresses.</p>

<h3>Use of Cookies and Spyware</h3>

<p>We never use or install spyware on your computer, nor do we use spyware to retrieve information
from your computer.&nbsp; Like many Websites, we use “cookies”, which are small text
files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain
online pages that record your preferences. We use cookies to track use of our
Website and online services. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic,
improve the Website and make it easier and/or relevant for your use.&nbsp; We may also
use Flash cookies, Javascript and other techniques to fingerprint you and prevent automated
scraping of information from the Website. You may
occasionally get cookies from companies advertising on our behalf (Google) or
from companies (Quantcast) we use to monitor site traffic. We do not control
these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to this cookie policy.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies, but cookies are
required in order to log into the Website or forum. Most web browsers
automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your
browser setting to decline cookies. For more information on cookies and how to
disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive
Advertising Bureau at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<h3>Is Information Collected From Children?</h3>

<p>This is not a Website directed to children under the age of 13, and CellarTracker
does not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children
under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age you should not use this
Website, and under no circumstance should you provide personally identifiable
information to CellarTracker. If CellarTracker discovers that a child under the
age of 13 has provided CellarTracker with personally identifiable information,
CellarTracker will immediately delete that child’s information from the
Website.</p>

<h3>How We Use Your Information?</h3>

<p>We use the information we learn from you to help us personalize and continually improve
your experience on the Website.&nbsp; We use the information to communicate with you
about products, services, promotional offers, update our records and generally
maintain your relationship with us.&nbsp; We also use this information to enable
third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our
behalf. Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we
do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to our Website
or your Personal Information collected online to any companies not affiliated
with us.</p>

<h3>Customer Service and Feedback</h3>

<p>We may use your Personal Information to provide customer service, track your compliance with
the Website’s rules and regulations, or for editorial and feedback purposes (to
the extent that is explained when you provide the information).&nbsp; In the event
we plan to publicly post any of your Personal Information on a Website
(as, for instance, a letter), we will request your permission to provide such posting.</p>

<h3>Use of Anonymous Information</h3>

<p>We use Anonymous Information to help us determine how people use parts of the Website and who
our users are so we can improve our Website and ensure that it is as appealing
as we can make it for as many people as possible.&nbsp; We also use Anonymous
Information to provide statistical "ratings" information in
aggregated form to our partners and other third parties about how our users
collectively use the Website. We may also use or share Anonymous Information
(or other information, other than Personal Information) in any other manner
that we deem appropriate or necessary.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Agents</h3>

<p>We occasionally have third party agents, affiliates and partners that perform functions on our
behalf, such as analytics or anti-scraping prevention, etc.&nbsp; These entities
have access to the subset of Personal Information needed to perform their
functions and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and
security of that Personal Information.&nbsp;They are restricted from using,
selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide
the requested services to the Website.</p>

<h3>Transactional Partners</h3>

<p>We may share non-personal information with our partners and others from time to time. Examples of such
non-personal information include the number of users who visited this Website
during a specific time period. This information generally is shared in an
aggregated form.</p>

<h3>Emergency Situations</h3>

<p>We may also use or disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the
good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable
law or comply with legal process served on us or the Website; (b) protect and
defend our rights or property, the Website or our users, and (c) act under
emergency circumstances to protect the our personal safety or the personal
safety of our affiliates, agents, the users of the Website, or the public.</p>

<h3>What Steps Are Taken To Keep Personal Information Secure?</h3>

<p>The importance of security for all Personal Information associated with you is of utmost concern to us. We
exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from
your PC to our servers.&nbsp; Personal Information collected by our Website is
stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public.&nbsp;
To the extent that you make a voluntary payment, this is typically either done
using Payflow Link or PayPal, and we do not have direct access to your
cardholder data. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request
proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.
While we try our best to safeguard your Personal Information once we receive it, no transmission of data
over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

<h3>What Happens When I Link To or From Another Web Site?</h3>

<p>The Website may contain links to other websites operated by affiliates of CellarTracker
or third parties. Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy
for CellarTracker do not apply to information gathered through these other web sites.
These other sites may also send their own cookies to you, collect your data or
solicit your Personal Information.&nbsp; Always be aware of where you end up. We are
not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third parties and other
websites.&nbsp; We encourage you to be aware of when you leave this Website and read the privacy
policies of each and every website that you visit.</p>

<h3>Governing Law/Assignment</h3>

<p>The Website is published in the United States of America.
We make every effort to protect the Personal Information of all
users of the Website. We attempt to comply with local data protection and
consumer rights laws to the extent they may apply to the CellarTracker
services.&nbsp; If you are uncertain whether this privacy policy conflicts with the
applicable local privacy laws where you are located, you should not submit your
Personal Information to CellarTracker.</p>

<p>We may change its ownership or corporate organization while providing the Website and
services. As a result, please be aware that we may transfer your information
to another CellarTracker that is affiliated with us or with which we have
merged. Under such circumstances CellarTracker would to the extent
possible require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this
Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time.</p>

<h3>Notice to European Users</h3>

<p>If you are located within the European Union, you should be aware that your Personal Information
will be transferred to the United States of America, the laws of which may be
deemed by the European Union to have inadequate data protection. If you are
located in a country outside the United States of America and voluntarily
submit Personal Information to us, you thereby consent to the general use of
such information as provided in this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of that
information to, and/or storage of that information in, the United States of
America.</p>

<h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>

<p>We are committed to maintaining our position as a premier Website on the Internet. As our
Website continues to develop, we may add new services and features to our
Website. In the event that these additions affect our Privacy Policy, this
document will be updated appropriately.&nbsp; We will post those changes prominently
so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that
information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.&nbsp; We do, however, recommend
that you read this Privacy Policy each time you use our website in case you
missed our notice of changes to the Privacy Policy.&nbsp; We will never, however,
materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of
customer information we have previously collected without your express consent.</p>

<h3>How Do I Opt-Out or Correct Information About Me</h3>

<p>You may always opt-out of receiving future e-mail messages and newsletters from
CellarTracker.&nbsp; We provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
communications from us <a href="http://www.cellartracker.com/privacy.asp">www.cellartracker.com/privacy.asp</a>.&nbsp;
We also give you access to a broad range of information about your account to
permit you to correct or update Personal Information that you have previously
provided to us at <a href="http://www.cellartracker.com/editprofile.asp">www.cellartracker.com/editprofile.asp</a>.
Or you can send us a message at <a href="mailto:editors@cellartracker.com">editors@cellartracker.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Your California Privacy Rights</h3>

<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of CellarTracker who are
California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of
Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To
make such a request, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:editors@cellartracker.com">editors@cellartracker.com</a>.</p></div> <!-- End article -->
