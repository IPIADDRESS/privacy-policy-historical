<h3>CelebrityPro.com's Privacy Statement</h3>
<div style="text-align : justify;margin-left : 5mm;margin-right : 5mm;margin-top : 5mm;margin-bottom : 5mm;">
<b>CelebrityPro.com, and its advertisers and affiliates are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users in general and, more specifically, to doing everything in their power to protect the privacy of our visitors. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information.
<br><br>
Consumer Information</b>
<br><br>
During the process of delivering content to you, CelebrityPro.com does not compile any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, or phone number. However, CelebrityPro.com does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). The information collected by CelebrityPro.com is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers as well as for site design optimization.
<br><br>
In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific ad (this ad may ask you to fill out a survey or provide your zip code) or other similar request. If this does occur, CelebrityPro.com may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser or for its own internal purposes. This information is used by an advertiser to respond to your request, or CelebrityPro.com may combine this information with other users' information and review it in an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a specific type of ad or visit a particular kind of website; however, every effort is made to ensure that this aggregation does not result in any sort of direct personal identification.<br><br>
In the case of subscriptions to newsletters or other services such as e-mail provided either exclusively by CelebrityPro.com or in conjunction with a third party, any personally identifiable information such as e-mail address is used solely for direct communications with those visitors. CelebrityPro.com does not, at present, provide any sort of user information other than overall site demographics to any third party and makes every effort to guard any information in its possession about the specific identity of its users. This includes any and all information provided intentionally or unintentionally including (but not limited to) e-mails or other contact initiated by visitors when contacting CelebrityPro.com. Visitors to CelebrityPro.com may reasonably expect that any personally identifiable information provided will remain private in perpetuity.
