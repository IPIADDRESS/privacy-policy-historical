			<div class="text main-text">
				<p><strong>a) When you visit our website</strong></p><p>When you visit our website www.celemony.com, the browser on your device automatically sends information to the server on our website. This information is temporarily stored in a so-called log file.  The following information is recorded without your intervention and stored until it is automatically deleted after 14 days:<br>• the IP address of the requesting computer;<br>• the date and time of access;<br>• the name and URL of the retrieved file;<br>• the volume of data transmitted;<br>• notification of successful retrieval;<br>• the website from which access is made (referrer URL);<br>• the browser you are using, the operating system of your computer and the name of your access provider.</p><p>The above-mentioned data will be processed by us for the following purposes:<br>• to ensure a smooth connection to the website;<br>• to assure a user-friendly experience on our website;<br>• for the evaluation of system security and stability;<br>• for other administrative purposes.</p><p>The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest follows from the purposes listed above for data collection. We do not use the data collected to draw any conclusions about you personally. Furthermore, this data is never merged with other data. We reserve the right, however, to examine the log files subsequently, should we become aware of any concrete indications of illegal use.</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned data, we use cookies and analysis services on our website. You will find further information concerning these in Sections 3 and 4 of this data protection declaration.</p><p><strong>b) When purchasing from our webshop</strong></p><p>When you order from our webshop, it is necessary for the performance of the contract that you enter  such “personal data” (within the meaning of the GDPR) as is required by us for the processing of your order e.g. your name, your address, your payment details and your e-mail address (to confirm that the contract has been concluded). Items of information that are essential to the execution of the contract are marked as such; the entering by you of any further information is voluntary. We process the data you enter so that we can fulfill your order. For this purpose, we may pass on your payment data to our house bank.</p><p>In the case of payment by credit card, the data (card number, cardholder, expiry date, card security code) provided by you during the payment process on the Internet will be forwarded directly to the respective payment service provider via the iPayment payment processing system (a service of 1&amp;1 Internet SE) integrated by our webshop . We do not ourselves store this data. Your data (e.g. your name, address, account or credit card number, passwords, TANs etc.) are then processed to the extent required for the payment to be made. The payment details entered, however, are only processed and stored by the payment service provider or payment processor. This means that we do not receive any account or credit card related information, but only information regarding confirmation or refusal of payment. As part of a possible identity and credit check, the payment service providers may also pass on data to credit agencies. For more detailed information, please refer to the general terms and conditions and data protection provisions of the payment service provider concerned, which can be accessed from its website or application within the framework of the transactions.</p><p>The legal basis for the above-mentioned data processing, in so far as the data are required for the fulfillment of your order, is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, or in the case of additional information you have provided freely, Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR.</p><p>We may also process the email address you provide when you complete your purchase to provide you with important technical information about the products you have purchased or to inform you of other products in our range that may be of interest to you. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR or Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR in conjunction with § 7(3) UWG (the German law against unfair competition). Our legitimate interests here are customer retention and the promotion of our business through the provision of product information based on your previous purchases and technical information relevant to you to maintain or enhance the performance of your products. You can object to our sending you product-related emails of this type without incurring any costs other than those of transmission at the current rates. For this purpose, it is enough to send an email to this effect to info@celemony.com or click on the “unsubscribe” link  provided at the end of each of our info emails.</p><p><strong>c) In the context of your myCelemony account</strong></p><p>As part of our online purchasing process (or online registration process, if the product was purchased from a physical retail outlet), you are asked to create a myCelemony user account by entering a user name and password. Your myCelemony account gives you a convenient overview of your licenses and customer data and provides you with the latest versions for your Celemony products. From your myCelemony account, you can also adjust your newsletter preferences, which provides you with an alternative method of unsubscribing. You can access your myCelemony account at any time and adjust your preferences. Your myCelemony account data cannot be seen by third parties.</p><p>The legal basis for the above-mentioned data processing is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the desire to foster customer loyalty and satisfaction by setting aside an area of the website from which you can obtain a clear overview of all your Celemony products as well as any updates that may be available, and where you can update your personal data and preferences in a swift and uncomplicated manner.</p><p><strong>d) When you activate your product</strong></p><p>Before you can avail yourself of the full functionality of your Celemony product, it must be activated via our server. This is a copy-protection measure.</p><p>In the course of the activation process, an automatic analysis of your device environment is conducted  and a license code generated, which is then stored on your hard disk. By combining this with another numerical code generated in the course of the above-mentioned analysis of your device environment and transmitted to our product, your authorization to use the software can be verified when the software is subsequently launched. The data stored by us in the course of this process comprises anonymous numerical codes from which no conclusions can be drawn either about you or your device environment.</p><p>The legal basis for the above-mentioned data processing is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in preventing the unlawful copying of our software.</p><p><strong>e) When you contact our Support team</strong></p><p>Any difficulties you may encounter in the use of our products can be raised with our Support team, usually by sending an e-mail to support@celemony.com. When you do so, any processing by us of the data you send us is for the sole purpose of responding to your requests. Once the matter in question has been resolved, we retain this data for a period of 3 years to increase the speed and quality of our response to further support requests.</p><p>The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interests lie in facilitating the problem-free use of our products by customers as well as, with respect to the storage of such data, increasing the efficiency of our future support efforts and thereby customer satisfaction.</p><p><strong>f) When you subscribe to our newsletter</strong></p><p>From various pages of our website you can subscribe to our free newsletter. Should you do so, the newsletter will be sent to the e-mail address you provide. You will then receive from us on, a regular basis, up-to-date information on updates, offers and workshops devoted to Celemony products. All data processing arising from the dispatch of the newsletter is confined to our own servers.<br>In addition to your e-mail address, we will store the times of your subscription and confirmation and the IP addresses used in each case. The purpose of this procedure is to verify your subscription and help us detect the possible abuse of your personal data.</p><p>The provision of additional data is voluntary; such data will be used to address you more personally.  If you have provided us with information regarding your place of residence, we will use it to avoid plying you with content of little interest to you. From the ZIP or postcode you have provided, for instance, we can avoid telling you about events that would require your travelling unreasonable distances to attend.</p><p>The purpose of this data processing is to facilitate the dispatch of our newsletter and our legal justification for processing the above-mentioned data is your consent within the meaning of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR. In as far as the details furnished by you are used to personalize the newsletter, this is based on our legitimate interests within the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Specifically, our aim here is to make the information we send you more relevant to you and enhance customer satisfaction.</p><p>If you are already a registered user, you have the possibility when subscribing to the newsletter of choosing between receiving information about Celemony products in general or only information relevant to the products you have purchased. In the latter case, we use the serial numbers of the products you have purchased, which are known to us as a result of the registration, for the further purpose of ensuring the newsletter we send you respects your wishes.</p><p>The legal basis for this data processing is your freely granted consent under Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR. You can object to this at any time either by changing the newsletter settings in your Celemony profile or simply by unsubscribing to the newsletter.</p><p>You can cancel your newsletter subscription at any time, for example, by clicking on the link provided for the purpose at the end of each newsletter. Alternatively, you can send an e-mail to info@celemony.com expressing your desire to unsubscribe.</p><p><strong>g) When you use our newsletter</strong></p><p>To assess the reach of our newsletter and its relevance to you, and so as to tailor its contents more closely to your needs, we integrate into our newsletter what are known as “web beacons” or “tracking pixels”, which are one-pixel image files that are stored on our website and loaded when the newsletter is opened. In conducting evaluations, we combine the data mentioned in Section 2(a) and the web beacons with your email address and individual ID. The links used in the newsletter also contain this ID. This allows us to ascertain which of the links contained in the newsletter you click on as your read it and to draw conclusions from this about your personal interests.</p><p>The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest here lies in our desire to make the newsletter more attractive and avoid plying you with information that is not relevant to you.</p><p>You can object to this tracking at any time by sending an e-mail to this effect to info@celemony.com or by unsubscribing to our newsletter altogether (see above). The information will be stored for as long as you remain subscribed to the newsletter.  If you unsubscribe, the data will be stored subsequently in a purely statistical and anonymous form. Furthermore, tracking using the web beacon is not possible if you have deactivated the display of images by your e-mail program. In this case, the newsletter will not be fully displayed and you may find it impossible to take advantage of all its functions. If, however, you manually authorize the display of images, the tracking described above will occur.</p>

			<h1 class="main-heading">5. Use of Google Remarketing Services</h1>
			<div class="text main-text">
				<p><strong>a) Google Adwords Conversion</strong></p><p>We use the service Google Adwords (of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountainview, California 94043, USA (“Google”)) to draw attention to our attractive offers with the help of advertising material (Google Adwords) on external websites. Using the data of such advertising campaigns, we can assess how successful the individual advertising measures are.  Our aim here is to display advertisements that are of interest to you, to make our website more interesting for you, and to attain a fair calculation of advertising costs.</p><p>This advertising material is delivered by Google via so-called “ad servers.” In addition, we use advertising server cookies, which allow us to measure certain parameters of success, such as the display of advertisements or clicks by users.  If you reach our website via a Google advertisement, Google Adwords will store a cookie on your PC. These cookies generally expire after 30 days and are not intended to identify you personally. As a rule, the unique cookie ID, the number of ad impressions per ad (frequency), the last impression (relevant for post-view conversions), and opt-out information (indication that the user does not wish to be addressed again) are stored as analytical values for this cookie.</p><p>These cookies allow Google to recognize your Internet browser. If a user visits certain pages of the website of an Adwords client and the cookie stored on the user’s computer has not yet expired, Google and the client can ascertain that the user has clicked on the advertisement and been forwarded to this page. Every Adwords client receives a different cookie. Cookies cannot therefore be tracked via the websites of Adwords clients. We do not collect and process any personal data using the above-mentioned advertising.  We simply receive from Google statistical evaluations. Based on these evaluations, we can recognize which of our implemented advertising measures are particularly effective.  We do not receive additional data from the use of advertising material; in particular, we cannot identify users based on this information.</p><p><strong>b) Google Remarketing</strong></p><p>In addition to Adwords conversion tracking, we use the application Google Remarketing. By using this application, our advertisements can be displayed to you during your use of the Internet after you have visited our website.  This is done by means of cookies that are stored on your browser and that Google uses to record and evaluate your user behavior when visiting various websites.  This allows Google to determine when you previously visited our website.  According to Google’s own statements, Google does not combine the data collected in the context of remarketing with personal data that Google may have stored in relation to you. In particular, according to Google, data are pseudonymized during remarketing.</p><p><strong>c) DoubleClick by Google</strong></p><p>This website also uses the online marketing tool DoubleClick by Google. DoubleClick uses cookies to display advertisements that are relevant to the user, to improve reports on the campaign’s success, or to avoid repeatedly showing the same advertisement to a particular user. Google uses a cookie ID to record which advertisements are displayed in which browser and can thus prevent a given advertisement being displayed multiple times. Furthermore, with the help of cookie IDs, DoubleClick can record “conversions” that are related to requests concerning advertisements. This is the case, for instance, when a user sees a DoubleClick advertisement and later visits the advertiser’s website and makes a purchase there using the same browser. According to Google, DoubleClick cookies do not contain personal data.</p><p><strong>d) The processing of your data by Google</strong></p><p>As a result of the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection with the Google server. We have no influence on the scope and the further use of the data that are collected by Google as a result of using this tool and are therefore providing you with the information at our disposal: the use of the tools described above means that Google receives the information that you have visited the corresponding section of our website or have clicked on one of our ads.  If you are registered with a service provided by Google, then Google can assign your visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or are not logged into your account, it is possible that the provider will recognize and store your IP address.</p><p><strong>e) Preventing tracking</strong><br>There are several ways of preventing your participation in this tracking process: 1. by changing the settings of your browser software; in particular, by rejecting third-party cookies, you will not receive ads from third-party providers; 2. by deactivating the cookies for conversion tracking by configuring your browser settings in such a way that cookies from the domain<br>„www.googleadservices.com“:http://www.googleadservices.com are blocked, using <a href="https://www.google.de/settings/ads;">www.google.de/settings/ads</a>  these settings will be deleted when you delete your cookies; 3.  by deactivating the interest-related ads of providers who are part of the self-regulation campaign “About Ads” using the link <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>, these settings will be deleted when you delete your cookies; 4. by means of a permanent deactivation in your Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Google Chrome browsers using the link <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin">www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin</a>. Please note that if you do this, you may not be able to make full use of all of the functions of this website.</p><p><strong>f) The legal basis for the processing of your data</strong></p><p>The legal basis for the processing of your personal data using the tools described above is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest in such data processing lies in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online services and ultimately in the promotion of our business activities.</p><p>For further information concerning DoubleClick by Google, please consult<a href="https://www.google.de/doubleclick">www.google.de/doubleclick</a> and regarding Google’s data protection policy in general: <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy">www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy</a> and <a href="https://services.google.com/sitestats/de.html">services.google.com/sitestats/de.html</a>.
