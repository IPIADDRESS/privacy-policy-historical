	<li class="cat-item cat-item-351"><a href="http://ceramicartsdaily.org/category/firing-techniques/raku-firing-techniques/" title="When most potters in the West think of raku firing, they think of what should technically be referred to as &quot;American&quot; or &quot;Western&quot; raku: a process in which work is removed from the kiln at bright red heat and subjected to post-firing reduction (or smoking) by being placed in containers of combustible materials, which blackens raw clay and causes crazing in the glaze surface. This Western raku firing process has a huge draw for many potters because of its excitement and unpredictability. Here, we have gathered articles and videos on raku firing that will appeal to the novice and the expert alike. And if you are looking for glazes for your raku work, don't forget to download your free copy of  <a href=&quot;/free-gifts/successful-tips-and-techniques-for-raku-firing-how-to-select-raku-clays-glazes-kilns-and-combustibles/&quot;>Successful Tips and Techniques for Raku Firing: How to Select Raku Clays, Glazes, Kilns and Combustibles</a>, a perfect resource for potters and ceramic artists who are ready to experiment with custom glazes, or for those who have grown tired of their own tried and true glazes.">Raku</a>

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-355"><a href="http://ceramicartsdaily.org/category/firing-techniques/salt-firing/" title="Salt firing is a vapor-glazing process where salt (sodium chloride) is introduced into kiln firebox at high temperature. The salt vaporizes, and sodium vapor combines with silica in clay surface, forming extremely hard sodium-silicate glaze. Many ceramic artists and potters use the salt firing technique to great creative effect on their work and in this section, they share tips, techniques, firing schedules and more. Plus, if you haven't already, be sure to download your free copy of the <a href=&quot;/free-gifts/the-salt-glaze-surface-a-guide-to-salt-glazing-and-firing/&quot;>The Salt Glaze Surface: A Guide to Salt Glazing and Firing</a>, a terrific reference if you are interested in salt firing.

In the soda firing process, soda ash (sodium carbonate) in water solution, instead of salt, is sprayed into kiln at maturing temperature, and sodium vapor combines with silica in clay to form sodium-silicate glaze. In this section, ceramic artists will share the results of their experimentation with the soda firing process. Youâll find everything from firing schedules to glaze recipes, to beautiful examples of soda fired work.
