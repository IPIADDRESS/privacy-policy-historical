In addition, when User registers with the Website, Company may ask User for certain additional information and it is within the discretion of User to provide.  User acknowledges and agrees that Company may collect and store User's name, username, password, email address, and any other information (including, without limitation, personally identifiable information) User provides to Company ("Data").

Accordingly, Company is not in a position to guarantee that User information will be secure under all circumstances and Company offers no warranties or representations with regards to the maintenance or non-disclosure of User Content, Data, or other personal information.  User agrees that Company Parties shall not be liable, under any circumstances, and User, for and on behalf of User and User's heirs, successors, assigns, and legal representatives, hereby forever releases and discharges Company Parties from any and all liabilities, claims, damages, actions, and losses in any way related to or connected with any loss or disclosure of User Content, Data, or other personal information.</p>
