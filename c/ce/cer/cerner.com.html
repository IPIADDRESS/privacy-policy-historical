    <p><font size="2">The following discloses Cerner’s information gathering and
    dissemination practices for Cerner.com. Additional terms and conditions, if any, regarding
    the collection and use of your information may also be provided to you before you sign up
    for a particular service (i.e. IQHealth.com and CKN.Cerner.com). Here you will learn what
    personally identifiable information of yours is collected, how and when Cerner might use
    your information, how Cerner protects your information, who has access to your
    information, and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. </font></p>
    <b></b><p><b></b><font size="2"><strong>What Information is Collected</strong><br>
    Cerner collects certain information from its users in three ways: (a) from Cerner Web
    server logs, (b) with cookies and (c) directly from the user. </font></p>
    <b></b><p><b></b><font size="2"><strong>(a) IP Addresses (Server Log Information)</strong><br>
    An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the
    Internet. All computer identification on the Internet is conducted with IP addresses,
    which allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other. Cerner
    collects IP addresses in order to conduct system administration, report aggregate
    information to affiliates, subsidiaries, sponsors, advertisers or partners, and to conduct
    site analysis. Cerner will also use IP addresses to identify any users who refuse to
    comply with Cerner's Terms of Use Agreement, and to identify users who threaten
    Cerner’s service, site, user, customers or others. </font></p>
    <b></b><p><b></b><font size="2"><strong>(b) Cookies</strong><br>
    Cerner places a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your
    computer. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's
