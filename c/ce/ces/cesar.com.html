For example, when customers place an online order in our catalogue stores or sign up for one of our catalogues online we may add them to the list to receive that catalogue. We may also use lists we have received from third parties or public sources to send you this information, and, as is routinely done in the catalogue business, may exchange names and addresses (but not e-mail addresses absent consent) of our catalogue customers with other catalogue companies who may also contact you by mail.

<p>We or our service providers or business partners use technologies like cookies and web beacons to offer certain functions at our website, to understand our visitors, and to offer ads at non-affiliated third-party websites, sometimes using information collected through technology at one of our family of websites and sometimes through third-party networks. Service providers or publishers may display ads for our products at unaffiliated third-party websites based on your online activities. We support self-regulatory programs for this practice, called interest-based advertising or online behavioral advertising, and ask our business partners to do the same. Find out more below at <a href="/global/policies/privacy/pp-english.aspx#internetad"><span id="pp_clickhere">What are our policies regarding online interest-based advertising?</span></a> Please note that third parties where you might see our ads have their own privacy statements and use technologies which we do not control.

<p id="internetad"><u>What are our policies regarding online interest-based advertising?</u></p>
<p>We support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance in the US and applies to US consumers. More information about these Principles can be <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/obaprinciples" target="_blank"><span id="pp_clickhere">found here</span></a>. Advertisements that we place online using interest-based data are expected to be delivered with the Advertising Option Icon to help consumers understand how their data is being collected and used and to provide choices for consumers who want more control. The Icon looks like this:</p>
<p style="HEIGHT: auto; COLOR: #f5ece3"><img title="title" alt="logo" src="/global/assets/images/center-content/Advertising_Option_Icon_new.jpg"></p>
<p>By clicking on the Icon when it appears, you can review information (and follow information) regarding online interest-based advertisements, including who is collecting and using your online data, how you can opt-out from receiving such advertisements, and more.</p>
<p><u>How do we serve advertisements through online interest-based advertising?</u></p>
<p>At times we display ads both on our network of owned and operated websites and on the websites of third parties. When you visit one of our websites or view ads that we serve elsewhere online, you may see different kinds of ads, such as text ads next to search results or video ads on web pages. Sometimes, these ads are based on the content of the pages on which they appear. Other times, these ads are generated by matching the particular ad to your interests as inferred from your online activities that have been collected over time. With interest-based advertising, the goal is to show you ads that are most relevant to you.</p>
<p>To do this, we and some of our third-party advertising companies use technologies such as cookies and web beacons to collect information about your interaction with our websites and other third-party websites (“Online Data”). This Online Data generally does not identify you to us personally and, typically, it is aggregated with other data to create segments – groups of users and certain general interest categories that we have inferred based on a variety of factors (for example, “sports fan”). The Online Data can include:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>The Web pages, products and services you view and links you click when using our websites and services as well as third-party websites;</b> </li>
<li><b>Our e-mails that you view and links you click on within that e-mail;</b> </li>
<li><b>Whether you view or click on ads that are shown to you;</b> </li>
<li><b>Demographic or interest data, including general geographic location derived from IP address;</b> </li>
<li><b>Offline purchase data that may be combined with Online Data to create a better profile regarding your interests or purchasing preferences; and</b> </li>
<li><b>The search terms you enter when using certain search services.</b></li></ol>
<p>We and our third-party advertising partners use this Online Data to paint a more accurate picture of the interests of the audiences with which we interact – including you – so that we can serve ads that are more relevant to those interests.</p>
<p>In addition, our third-party advertising partners use this Online Data for a variety of other purposes, including (a) in conjunction with advertising that appears on our website or other websites, (b) for reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisement data and other interaction with ads and the websites on which they are served, and (c) to measure the effectiveness of web-based and e-mail advertisements.</p>
<p><u>Why would you want to receive interest-based ads?</u></p>
<p>Consumers like to receive interest-based ads for many different reasons. Interest-based ads are helpful because they are more tailored to your particular interests. For example, cat owners may see more ads for cat food and fewer ads for dog grooming services. Interest-based ads also are more likely to help them discover new products and services that are actually relevant to them and their interests. For example, dog owners may see an ad about the latest dog-grooming products, whereas cat owners might be more likely to see an ad for the latest feline hairball solution. In short, receiving interest-based ads can help to improve their access to new products, services and features that are most relevant to them, which in turn could help to improve their life and social experiences. Consumers also will not see the same ads over and over from us because the number of times they see a particular interest-based ad is limited. By opting-out of interest-based ads, they lose all of these benefits.</p>
<p><u>How can consumers opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from us? </u></p>
<p>If consumers do not want this website to show them interest-based ads they can opt-out by following the instructions <a href="http://www.mars.com/global/policies/adchoices/ac-english.aspx?eid=2155">here</a>. If they do not want to receive interest-based ads from any of our US sites, they need to click the AdChoices link in the footer section of that website and follow the instructions there. Please note, however, that opting-out does not mean they will no longer see ads from us online. It simply means that the online ads from us they do see will not be based on their particular interests.</p>

<p><b>What else do you need to know?</b></p>
<p><u>Where is your information stored and processed? </u></p>
<p>Personal information collected on our websites and services ,or received by Mars from you or third parties, may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where we or our service providers maintain facilities.</p>
<p>The servers and databases in which information may be stored may be located outside the country from which you accessed this website and in a country that does not have the same privacy laws as your country of residence. The personal information you provide us may be transmitted abroad, but we will collect, process and use personal information only in accordance with this privacy statement.</p>
<p>Employment-related queries may also be transferred to any member of the Mars family of companies. By visiting this website and submitting information, you consent to such collection, processing, transfer and/or storage of your personal information. Please note: our policies may differ by region, so if you visit one of our websites in a different region, please check to see if there is a statement specific to that location.</p>
<p><u>What about chat rooms, message boards, or other interactive forums?</u></p>
<p>We may offer chat rooms, message or bulletin boards, or interactive areas where visitors may post comments or information for our visitors’ enjoyment. If there is a chat room, bulletin or message board, social networking opportunities or other interactive areas where personal information may be posted at this website, be sure to check posted rules before entering, as you will be bound by them as well as our General Terms and Conditions. Rules for participation in interactive features may establish age and other restrictions on participation.

<p><u>How do we safeguard your information? </u></p>
<p>We have implemented administrative, physical and technical safeguards designed to protect your information. If online shopping is permitted at the website, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to communicate with your browser software when you order from us online and thereby provide us with payment card or related information. SSL is the industry standard security protocol, which makes it very difficult for anyone else to intercept your credit card / transaction and order information that you send us when you submit your online order. Otherwise, the transmission of information to and from us is not encrypted or secure. We limit access to personal information to those who have a business need. We keep personal information only for a reasonably needed amount of time. </p>
<p>No security measures can be 100% secure, however, and so we recommend that you take additional measures to protect yourself and your information, including by installing up to date anti-virus software, closing browsers after use, keeping confidential your log-in credentials and passwords, and making sure that you regularly update software and apps you have downloaded to ensure you have enabled the latest security features on your devices. </p>
