This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") describes how we collect information from you or about you online through our website at  </span><a href="/" class="normal">www.cedars-sinai.edu</a><span class="normal"> ("website"), why we collect this information, how we will use or disclose this information and how you may update or delete identifiable information about you from our records. By accessing, browsing and/or using our website, you are deemed to accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you are not willing to accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our website.  </span></p><p><span class="normal"> This Privacy Policy does not apply to our information collection and use policy or practices offline.   </span><span class="bold"> This information is available on the </span><a href="6913.html" class="bold">HIPAA Privacy Practices</a><span class="bold"> page. </span></p><p></p><div class="blackheader">Information Collection and Use</div><br><span class="normal"> The information we gather generally can be categorized as either anonymous or personally identifiable. 
 </span><p><span class="normal"> Anonymous (or sometimes referred to as "aggregate") information is information that cannot be traced back to a specific individual. For example, we know how many times our site and certain portions of our site is visited, but we do not know the names, e-mail addresses or gender of our visitors unless they specifically provide that information. We use this anonymous information to obtain a better understanding of how visitors use our website and to make decisions on how to improve it. Each time a visitor comes to our site, we collect some information in an effort to improve the overall quality of your online experience. We collect the visitor's domain name (e.g. whether the user is logged on from yahoo.com, aol.com etc), referral data (e.g., the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to our website), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). In addition to collecting these types of information, CSHS collects aggregate queries for internal reporting. We also count, track, and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our site (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within our site, etc.).  </span></p><p><span class="normal"> Personally identifiable information is information you provide that lets us know specific facts about you so that we can respond to your requests. Depending on the portion of the website you visit and the information you provide, this information could range from your name, address and ZIP code, which you provide in order to receive information from us about certain services, to specific health information that you provide to us on an admission form. Personal information collected on our site is used only to allow us to fulfill your request for services. For instance, if you use our online physical system to locate a specialist in your area, we use the information you provide to put you in touch with a physician. Similarly, if you complete an admission form that you download from our site and submit it to us, we use the information contained in your admission form for the purposes of admitting you to CSHS and to thereafter providing the services your physician prescribes. Another example relates to our gift shop. We collect personal information from you in order to complete transactions you request The information you provide may be furnished to a third party in order to facilitate the transaction. Or, you may submit personal information to us in response to an employment opportunity. In each case, we use your personal information only for the purpose it is submitted to us, which may include providing it to third parties with whom we have relationships to deliver the information or services you request.  </span></p><p><span class="normal"> Our website makes forums and bulletin boards available to our users through our Personal Health Manager.
