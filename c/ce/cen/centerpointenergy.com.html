						<p>This Privacy Policy describes how CenterPoint Energy handles information we learn about you from your visit to our Web site. The information we receive depends on what you do when you visit our site.</p>
						
						<p>For each visitor to our Web page, we automatically collect the domain name, IP address, and e-mail address (where possible) of visitors to our Web page, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, user-specific information on what pages consumers access or visit, information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations.</p>
						
						<p>The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web page, to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each individual visitor, to notify consumers about updates to our Web site, and to contact consumers for marketing purposes. The information may also be shared with other reputable organizations to help them contact consumers for marketing purposes. CenterPoint Energy reserves the right to transfer aggregated user information to third parties, provided that no personal information relating to any individual user is disclosed. The statements in this paragraph about using Web site visitor information for marketing purposes do not apply to personal data supplied by job seekers who register on the Careers Web site and complete an information profile. Please review our <a href="/cnp/common/1,3163,111337,00.html">CNP Careers Privacy Statement</a> for additional information.</p>
						
						<p>With respect to cookies: We use cookies to store visitors preferences, record session information, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our site, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, and ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads.</p>
						
						<p>If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by sending us an e-mail at the above address. From time to time, we make the e-mail addresses of our customers and/or those who access our site available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you might find interesting.

						<p>If you supply us with additional information on-line (your name, postal address, telephone number, or any other identifying information), you may be contacted by us or by other reputable companies (by mail, e-mail, or telephone) with information on new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such communications, you will be provided an opportunity to "opt-out" of such uses at the time you provide the information to us. Or you can e-mail us at any time and we will remove your name from our contact list at your request.</p>
						
						<p>From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses.

In areas of the CenterPoint Energy Web site that may be of particular interest to children, we will use our best efforts not to collect personal information from those identifying themselves as under age 18. CenterPoint Energy encourages parents to take an active role in their children's use of the Internet and to spend time online with their children. If you believe that your child has submitted personal information to CenterPoint Energy inadvertently, we will delete all such information from our database at your request.</p>
