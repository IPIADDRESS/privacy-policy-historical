                      <br>
                      <br>
              We want you to be informed of our commitment to  protect the privacy of your personal financial information with the following  privacy principles<sup style="line-height:0;">3</sup>:</span></p>
<h2>Collecting Information</h2>

<h2><strong>Information We Disclose</strong></h2>
<p class="notop">
 <b>A. Within Central Pacific Financial Corp.</b><br>
 The Central Pacific Financial Corp. family is made  up of companies providing financial and other services, including Central  Pacific Bank (CPB), Central Pacific HomeLoans, Inc., a mortgage broker, and  others. We may share the customer information we collect described in the  “Collecting Information” section with Affiliates.&nbsp; By sharing information with Affiliates, we  hope to better serve your financial needs. You may, however, opt-out of the use  of such information by CPB and its affiliates for marketing purposes.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>B. With Outside Companies</b><br>
                  We may share the customer information we collect  described in the “Collecting Information” section, but only to the extent  permitted by law with the following types of companies outside Central Pacific  Financial Corp.:
</p><ul>
              
<li>
  <p>Financial service  providers selected to provide our customers with specialized financial  services, such as securities broker dealers or insurance companies. We disclose  information only when we believe that this information is needed to offer you  the product or service.<br>       
</p>
  </li><li>Companies that provide support services for us for  the purposes of servicing your account or performing marketing or similar  services on our behalf or to financial institutions with whom we have joint  marketing agreements, such as companies that provide you products and services  that you’ve requested or already have with us. These companies may include  check printers and companies that prepare or mail account statements. These  companies are subject to contractual confidentiality provisions and may use the  customer information we share only to provide the services we ask them to  perform for you and us.
  </li></ul>
<b><br>
C. In Other Situations</b><br>
We may also disclose certain customer information  to government entities, credit bureaus and similar organizations, and otherwise  as permitted by law. For example, customer information may be disclosed in  connection with a subpoena or similar legal process, a fraud investigation, the  recording of a mortgage in public records, or to provide information with your  consent.<br>                  <br>
                  <b>D. <strong>Credit Bureau  Information</strong></b><br>

                    <br>
</p>
              <h2>Former Customers</h2>
              <p>If  you decide to close your account(s) or become an inactive customer, we will  continue to honor your request to opt-out of information sharing; however, you  may receive marketing offers.</p>
      <br>

<h2>Security Procedures</h2>
<p class="notop">We also take steps to safeguard customer  information. We restrict access to your personal and account information to  those employees who need to know that information to provide products or  services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards  that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal  information.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<h2>Medical Information</h2>
<p class="notop">You may sometimes provide medical information to us  as part of an application for insurance. We do not share medical information  among our family of companies or with third parties except to those who require  access to this information in order to process the application. <strong>We will not obtain, use, re-disclose or  share – internally or externally – personal identifiable medical information in  determining credit eligibility except as allowed by law, as disclosed to you  when the information is collected, or when you consent.</strong> Medical information  (such as information related to your past, present, or future physical or  mental health or condition) or the provision or payment of such healthcare  services obtained as part of an application for insurance is shared only with  those who require access to this information in order to process the  application. </p><br>
