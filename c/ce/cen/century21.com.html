        <b>PRIVACY STATEMENT</b><br>
        <b>Last modified July 3, 2008</b>
         <p>
         </p><h3>Introduction</h3>
         <p>




<b>Century 21 Real Estate LLC</b> operates the web site at <b>www.century21.com</b>
("Site").  We respect the privacy of each user of the Site (referred to as "you" 
or "a user"), whether you are just beginning your real estate search or have 
previously visited our Site.  This Privacy Statement gives you specific 
information about how we protect your privacy, how we treat information we 
collect on the Site that identifies an individual user ("Personal Information"), 
and how we use aggregated information.
</p><p>
<b>BY REGISTERING FOR OR USING THE SITE, YOU
SIGNIFY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS 
PRIVACY STATEMENT, YOU CANNOT USE THE SITE.</b>  We reserve the right to modify 
this Statement at any time by posting a notice on the Site's home page.  (If we 
consider it appropriate, we may also provide additional notice of significant 
changes.)  Your use of the Site after the date of the last modification listed 
at the beginning of this Privacy Statement indicates to us that you agree to the 
changes. 
</p><p>
</p><h3>Location of Servers and Transfer of Information to the United States</h3>
The Site is hosted by servers in the United States.  If you are located outside 
of the United States, your Personal Information will be transferred to the 
United States.  By submitting your Personal Information, you consent to its 
transfer to the United States and to its storage, processing, and use there in 
accordance with this Privacy Statement.
<p>
</p><h3>Scope of this Privacy Statement</h3>
This Privacy Statement applies to your use
of this Site only. We do not own, operate or control the web sites of our
Franchisees or sales associates.  Accordingly, this Statement does not apply to
a Franchisee's or sales associate's web site or to a Franchisee's or sales
associate's collection, use, storage and disclosure of your Personal
Information.
<p>
    </p><h3>1.	Collection and Use of Your Personal Information</h3>
    We collect your
Personal Information on the Site in order to enhance the services we offer you.
We collect Personal Information from you only when you voluntarily submit it in
order to obtain certain services or information, including (A) registrations for
special communications, such as saving a search for you and, but only if you
request it, sending you new listings that fit the profile of your saved search;
(B) requests to find a property, to list your property, and to find a sales
associate; (C) requests to contact us; (D) requests to receive periodic industry
updates; (E) requests to email a listing to a friend; (F) applications for
employment; and (G) inquiries about franchising opportunities.
<p> 
</p><h4>Requests to Find or List a Property and to Find a Sales Associate</h4>
    If you submit a request through this Site to find or list a property or to 
    find a 
sales associate, you will be asked to provide Personal Information and we refer 
this information to Franchisees or sales associates to respond to your request.  
For example, if you ask that we list your property or if you ask to see more 
listings in a given area, you will be directed to a Franchisee in that area.
<p>
</p><h4>Contacting Us</h4>
If you contact us, we collect Personal Information, which is retained or referred to an independent Franchisee or sales associate depending on the nature of your inquiry.  If you are looking for a property or a sales associate, it is referred to a Franchisee or sales associate; if your inquiry or complaint requires a response from us, it is referred to the appropriate department for research and a response.  The information we collect is not used in any other way and is not retained after one year.  
<p>
</p><h4>Refer a Listing to a Friend</h4>
If you choose to send a listing to a friend, you will be asked to provide the friend's name and email address in order to personalize the email and to send the email.  We do not store this information, and the information is used only to send the one-time referral email.
<p>
</p><h4>Employment Inquiry</h4>
If you are seeking employment, you will be asked to provide Personal Information about yourself.  We refer this information to Franchisees in the geographic area in which you live. 
<p>
</p><h3>2.	Collection of Non-Personal Information</h3>
Even if you do not send us any Personal Information, we collect information about how you use our site ("Non-Personal Information"). This information cannot be used to identify you personally and is explained in more detail below under "Non-Personal Information".
<p>
</p><h4>Cookies</h4>
A cookie is a small data file, often including an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent from a web site's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive.  Use of cookies is common on the Internet.  A web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser permits a web site to access only the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.  You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. But if you refuse cookies, some parts of the Site will not function properly and may not provide services or information you have requested.  For example, without cookies, we will not be able to provide you with searches that you have asked us to save. 
<p>
</p><h4>Non-Personal Information</h4>
Like many sites, we obtain Non-Personal Information such as IP (internet protocol) addresses, browser types, the name of your ISP (internet service provider), information about where a user comes from before arriving at our Site, what pages a user visits, the order of those pages, and the amount of time spent on each.  A vendor performs this service for us by sending a cookie to gather this information, compile it, and report to us.  We use Non-Personal Information to customize the advertising and content you see, improve our services, conduct research, and provide anonymous aggregated reporting for internal audits and third-parties.
<p>
</p><h4>Advertising Networks</h4>
We send to your web browser some of the advertisements you see when you use our network of web sites. However, we also allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our web pages. Because your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad network web site, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web page from the web site. Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.  As always, remember we authorize our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies only for ad delivery and anonymous targeting.  Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access, to any Personal Information about you.  
<p>
</p><h4>Opting Out of Third-Party Ad Servers</h4>
If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you must visit each ad network's web site individually and opt out (if they offer this capability). Currently, we have relationships with the following third-party ad networks (click to visit their Web sites and review their privacy statements): 
    <p>
        	24/7 Real Media, Inc.  <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.247realmedia.com/privacy.html" title="You have selected a link to a website that is not owned or maintained by Century21.com.  Different terms of use and privacy policies will apply.">http://www.247realmedia.com/privacy.html</a>
</p><p>
</p><h3>3.	Use of Information</h3>
We use the Personal Information and the Non-Personal Information we collect on the Site (A) to provide you with the services that you ask to receive through the Site, including saving searches and, if you request it, sending you updates about those searches; (B) to receive, if you choose, to receive periodic industry updates; (C) to answer your questions or complaints; (D) to refer you to Franchisees and sales associates about finding or listing a property or to locate a sale associate; (E) to refer a listing to a friend; and (F) inquiries about franchising opportunities.
and (G) for analytical purposes to help us improve the Site and for our business generally.
<p>
</p><h3>4.	Sharing Your Information</h3>

</p><p>

If you hold your mouse over a link, it will indicate whether clicking the link will send you off our Site.  When you click on those links, you will go to a third-party site where you will be subject to that site's privacy statement and we encourage you to read that policy statement.  Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those other web sites and we expressly disclaim any liability for their actions, including actions relating to the use and disclosure of Personal Information by those third parties.  We remind you to be aware of when you leave our Site and enter a third-party web site, including one of our independent Franchisees, and again encourage you to read the privacy statement on any web site that collects your Personal Information.
