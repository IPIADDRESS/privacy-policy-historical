              <p>Centerstage Media LLC respects your right to privacy, and is 

                the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will 

                not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different 

                than disclosed in this statement.</p>

              <p><b>Postings</b><br>

                In order to authenticate postings on our site (protecting other 

                the rights of individuals from malicious postings), we require 

                you to provide your email address. By providing any information 

                to Centerstage Media for posting, you are agreeing to allow us 

                to utilize this information for such purposes. Because of the 

                nature of the internet, such data will be broadly available wherever 

                and whenever the site is visible.</p>

              <p><b>Log Files</b><br>

                We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track 

                user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for 

                aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable 

                information.<br>

                <br>

                <b>Sharing anonymous, aggregate information<br>

                </b>Centerstage Media may share user information with others in 

                anonymous, aggregate format for the purpose of analyzing usage 

                trends.</p>

              <p><b>Cookies</b><br>

                Centerstage Media reserves the right to place private web browser 

                "Cookies" on your hard drive to help provide a more 

                pleasant user experience, even if it is not doing so currently. 

                A cookie is a small piece of information that a website can store 

                on your web browser and later retrieve. The cookie cannot be read 

                by any website other than the one that set up the cookie. We do 

                NOT use cookies to examine your surfing behavior before or after 

                leaving Centerstage Media website. If we were to use them, it 

                would be for purposes directly benefiting you - for example, helping 

                you retrieve the results of past searches. Some of our business 

                partners (for example, advertisers) may use cookies on our site. 

                However, we have no access to, or control over, these cookies.</p>

              <p><b>Other Information</b><br>

                If we require your name, address, phone number, credit card number, 

                or any other information at any point on our site, we will not 

                share it with any companies outside Centerstage Media, its subsidiaries, 

                affiliates or necessary payment processors. Note that partners 

                who provide services which necessitate this sort of personal information 

                (for example, but not limited to, travel services, book and movie 

                purchases) will have their own policy regarding these matters, 

                and neither entity will be constrained by any agreements which 

                may exist between you and the other party.<br>

                <br>

                <b>Having a Problem?</b><br>

                If at any time you believe that Centerstage Media has not followed 

                the above policy, or if you would like your information to be 

                revised on or removed from our system, please describe the necessary
