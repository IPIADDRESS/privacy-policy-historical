<h2>Security Statement</h2>
<p>Your personal information is protected by law.

Penalties apply to those who fail to observe these provisions.</p>
<p>Centrelink encrypts all messages between the browser running on your PC and Centrelink's computers when these messages are sent from the Secure Messages section of the website.</p>

<p>While Centrelink endeavours to provide a secure internet environment, users should note that there are inherent risks associated with transmission of information via the internet.  Centrelink provides alternative ways to obtain and provide information for those who do not wish to use public networks such as the internet.  These include, direct contact at a Customer Service Centre, telephone, facsimile or post.  In some circumstances, the Centrelink security guidelines may also require us to send particular information by non-electronic means.</p>
