			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>Effective June 27, 2008</p>
			
			<h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
			
			
			
			<p>CenturyLink, Inc. and its subsidiary and affiliated entities (collectively, "CenturyLink") respect and are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers.  In this Policy, CenturyLink and its subsidiaries and affiliates are collectively referred to as the "Company."  As a leading provider of telecommunications and related products and services, we recognize that we must maintain the confidentiality of every customer's telephone calling and other account information.</p>

			<p>We also respect and protect the privacy of those who visit our Web sites. Advances in technology have led to the rapid expansion of online services, as well as privacy concerns unique to the online environment. We recognize the need to maintain the confidentiality of information that Web visitors reasonably expect to remain private.</p>

			<p>In furtherance of our commitment to protect the privacy of our customers and Web visitors, the Company has established various policies and procedures designed to safeguard your personal information. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes those policies and procedures, as well as how we collect and use various types of information. We encourage you to read this Policy in its entirety.</p>
			
			<a name="top"></a>
			<h3>Privacy policy contents</h3>
			
			<ul class="toc">
			  
			  <li><a href="#1">Collection and Use of Personal Data</a></li>
			  <li><a href="#adv">Collection and Use of Online Data</a></li>
			  <li><a href="#3">My Account</a></li>
			  <li><a href="#4">How We Protect Your Information</a></li>
			  <li><a href="#5">Changes to this Policy</a></li>
			  <li><a href="#6">Contact Us with Your Privacy Questions or Concerns</a></li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h3>The Scope of This Privacy Policy</h3>
			
			<p>This Policy addresses the privacy of CenturyLink retail customers and Web visitors in the United States. This Policy also identifies the types of data and information we collect, how we use it, how you can control its use and the steps we take to protect it.</p>  

			<p>This Policy supersedes and replaces all previously posted privacy policies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when you sign up for certain CenturyLink services, you may agree to additional privacy policies that address service-specific privacy practices.</p>
			
			<hr class="divider">
			
			<!-- ================================================================================ -->
			
			<a name="1"></a>
			<h3>Collection and Use of Personal Data</h3>
			 			
			<p><b>Personally identifying information</b><br>
			The primary focus of this Policy is non-public information that identifies or that is linked to the identity of a particular customer or Web visitor, sometimes referred to as "personally identifying information" or "PII." Examples of personally identifying information include combinations of name; address; e-mail address; user IDs and passwords; telephone number; billing, payment, usage, credit and transaction information (including credit card numbers, account numbers and/or social security number); and demographic information.</p>
			
			<p>We collect personally identifying information regarding our customers, including information customers give us, information collected as a result of the customer's relationship with us and information we obtain from other sources.</p>
						
			<p>We also collect personally identifying information that our Web visitors choose to provide to us (e.g., name, address, telephone number, e-mail address) when registering on our Web sites; ordering CenturyLink products or services; sending us e-mail; responding to our surveys; entering contests or sweepstakes; or in connection with online ordering or billing functions. As a general rule, you can visit CenturyLink Web sites without revealing personally identifying information. However, some portions of our Web sites may be accessible to you only if you register with us and, if you choose to register with us, you may be asked to provide the Company with personally identifying information.
</p>

			<p>CenturyLink uses personally identifying information to better understand your needs and interests, and to provide you with better service. Once you choose to provide us with personally identifying information, it will be used to support your customer relationship with us, and we will not disclose your personal information to others in any manner contrary to the terms of this Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, please note that the decision to provide us with your personally identifying information is purely voluntary, and you will have an opportunity to decline to provide such information each time we request it.</p>

			<p>When you supply information about yourself for a specific purpose, we use the information for that purpose.  For example, we use your information to help you complete a transaction or order, to communicate with you, to provide service and support, or to update you on services and benefits.  We also may use your personally identifying information for the following general purposes:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>To help us deliver the products and/or services you have requested.</li>
				<li>To design or offer specific products or services that we believe will be useful to you.</li>
				<li>To send you information about our company and some of our partners.</li>
				<li>To manage and upgrade our Web sites.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>We may aggregate the personally identifying information of different customers or Web visitors to produce data about a group or category of services, customers or Web visitors.  For example, we might use aggregate data about the types of services our customers have generally purchased at the same time in order to develop attractive bundled service offerings.  Such aggregate data, however, will not reflect any personally identifying information of any specific customer or Web visitor.</p>

			<p><b>Non-personally identifying information</b><br>
			Non-personally identifying information is data about usage and service operation that is not associated with the identity of a particular customer or Web visitor.  Examples of non-personally identifying information include your browser type and the pages visited on our Web sites.</p>

			<p>CenturyLink may collect and analyze non-personally identifying information to evaluate how visitors use our Web sites. Most non-personally identifying information is collected via cookies or other analysis technologies. Our Web pages use cookies, statistics tracking, and other technologies for data analysis and personalization services.</p>

			<p><b>Personally identifying information we disclose to third parties</b><br>
			In general, CenturyLink does not sell, lease or otherwise disclose personally identifying information to third parties without your consent. The following exceptions to this general rule apply:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>We may provide personally identifying information to third parties to comply with court orders, subpoenas, or other legal or regulatory requirements. Please note that we do not release customer information to any agency or organization without proper authorization. Requests are processed by CenturyLink, not by third parties, and are carefully verified by our in-house team. Our commitment to you extends beyond our service - that's the personal touch we deliver.</li>

				<li>We may provide personally identifying information to third parties to notify law enforcement or any other responsible governmental entity if it is believed in good faith that such action is necessary to protect public safety or to protect the employees or property of the Company.</li>

				<li>We may, where permitted or required by law, provide personally identifying information to third parties (including credit bureaus or collection agencies) to obtain payment for CenturyLink-provided products and services and/or enforce or apply our customer agreements.</li>

				<li>We may provide personally identifying information to third parties to prevent unlawful use of communications or other services, to assist in repairing service outages or interruptions, and when a call is made to 911 from a customer phone and information regarding the caller's location is transmitted to a public safety agency.</li>

				<li>We may also provide personally identifying information to third parties who perform functions or services on our behalf. Examples include shipping companies who deliver CenturyLink products; CenturyLink-authorized agents who market and sell products and services on our behalf; and Web site development or advertising companies, who provide Web design, analysis and advertising services. When we provide such personally identifying information to third parties to perform such functions or services on our behalf, we require that they protect personally identifying information in a manner consistent with this Policy and do not allow them to use such information for other purposes.</li>

				<li>We may provide personally identifying information to third parties where required to provide certain CenturyLink-offered products and services. For example, we disclose certain CenturyLink | DISH Network-related personally identifying information to Echostar Satellite Corporation, L.L.C. and its affiliates solely in order to provide CenturyLink | DISH Network services.</li>

				<li>A customer's name and telephone number may also be transmitted and displayed on a Caller ID device unless the customer has elected to block such information.  Caller ID Blocking does not prevent the display of the number when you dial certain business numbers, 911, 900 numbers or toll-free 800, 888, 877 or 866 numbers.</li>

				<li>We may provide personally identifying information to third parties through the directories that we publish and distribute in print and on the Internet. We may also make such information available through our directory assistance services. We are required by law to provide published customer names, addresses and telephone numbers (or non-published status) to unaffiliated directory publishers and directory assistance providers, over whom the Company has no control, for their use in creating directories and offering directory assistance services. When a customer subscribes to CenturyLink local telephone service, we offer the opportunity to request that the customer's name, number, and address not be published in our directories or made available through our directory assistance. For more information on controlling the disclosure of this information and/or obtaining a non-published or non-listed number, please contact a CenturyLink representative.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><b>"Do Not Call" Lists</b><br>
We comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding "Do Not Call" lists. Residential consumers may request that they be removed from CenturyLink's telemarketing lists at any time, including when a marketing and promotional call is received or by contacting a CenturyLink representative. Where required by state laws and/or regulations, we also honor requests from business customers to be removed from our telemarketing lists. 
</p>

			<p><b>Customer Proprietary Network Information</b><br>
In the normal course of providing telecommunications services to our customers, we collect and maintain certain customer proprietary network information, also known as "CPNI."  CPNI includes the types of services you buy, how much you use those services and how they are provided, as well as related billing information for those services.  Your name, address, and telephone number are not CPNI.</p>
			
			<p>The Company complies with all applicable laws and regulations regarding CPNI. If CenturyLink is your telecommunications carrier and you have a question about CPNI, please contact us. We will be happy to answer any questions you have about CPNI and provide you with a detailed explanation of your options under federal law to restrict the use of CPNI.</p>

			<h3>Collection and Use of Online Data</h3>
			
			<p><b>Web usage information we collect and use</b><br> 
When Web visitors access our Web sites, we automatically receive certain Web usage information.  For example, our Web servers automatically collect statistical information about your visit such as your IP address, your Web browser and operating system types, and the identity of the Web page from which your browser entered our Web site.  In addition, primarily through the use of cookies or Web beacons, we may collect other Web usage information, such as the Web pages the browser visits on our Web sites, the amount of time spent on such Web pages and whether the browser re-visits our Web sites/pages.  None of this Web usage information is linked to you as an individual.  We use this statistical information to monitor our Web sites' performance and to provide our customers and Web visitors with a richer, more relevant Web surfing experience.</p>
			
			<p><b>Cookies and Web beacons</b><br> 
			CenturyLink collects information about your computer hardware and software - for example, your IP address, domain name, and access times - using "cookies." Cookies are files that Web browsers place on the computer of a Web visitor and that identify such visitor as a unique user.</p>

			<p>We, or a third party acting on our behalf, may use cookies to tailor and improve the content we deliver to our Web visitors, to improve our Web site by assessing which areas, features, and products are most popular, and to personalize our Web site and make recommendations based on information, including product choices, a particular visitor has previously provided.  For example, we may use a cookie to identify your phone number so we do not ask you to enter it more than once.  We also use cookies to store user preferences, complete online order activity and keep track of transactions.</p>

			<p>We, or a third party acting on our behalf, may use Web beacons (also known as "clear gifs" or "one-pixel gifs") in certain of our Web pages and e-mails to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and e-mail correspondence.  For example, we may use Web beacons in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by the recipients.</p>

			<p>You can configure your Web browser to alert you when a Web site is attempting to send a cookie to your computer and allow you to accept or refuse the cookie. You can also set your browser to disable the capacity to receive cookies or you can delete cookies previously accepted. Some CenturyLink Web pages (and other Web pages) may not work correctly if you have cookies disabled.</p>

			<p>When you interact with our Web site, we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful.  Our site uses session cookies to track Web visitor behavior and to allow our customers to immediately save their user IDs, as well as personal settings on specific pages.  This allows us to process your information and quickly log you into the product.  Session cookies also help us make sure you are who you say you are after you have logged in.</p>

			<p>We use persistent cookies, which only CenturyLink can read and use, to identify the fact that you are either a CenturyLink customer, or a prior CenturyLink Web site visitor. We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will still be able to browse our Web sites; however, they may lose some of the functionality provided by the use of persistent cookies.</p>

			<p>You can prevent our Web sites from using cookies or be notified when a cookie is being used by following the instructions below.  However, cookies must be enabled for My Account to function properly.  Instructions on enabling and disabling cookies are listed below.</p>
			
				
			<p><b>How to enable cookies</b><br> 
To enable cookies, follow the instructions below for the browser version you are using.</p>

						
			<p><b>How to disable cookies</b><br> 
			At any time, you may choose to change your browser settings to disable cookies; however, please be aware that cookies may be required to complete certain functions on our Web sites, such as ordering online. To disable cookies, select "Help" from the toolbar of your browser window for directions.  For additional information about cookies, visit <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com/" alt="www.cookiecentral.com" target="_blank">www.cookiecentral.com</a>.</p>
 
    
			
			<p><b>Online advertising</b><br>
We may use advertising companies to deliver ads for CenturyLink-offered services and products on our Web sites or on third party Web sites. These online ads include, but are not limited to, banner ads. These online ads may contain third-party cookies or Web beacons that allow tracking of visitors' responses to our advertisements, which responses assist us in measuring the effectiveness of our ads. Although these third parties may receive anonymous Web usage information about ad viewing on such Web sites, we prohibit them from using this information in any manner contrary to the terms of this Policy.</p>


			<p><b>Our email marketing practices </b><br>
We periodically send our customers news about products, new offers, and special promotions by e-mail. When you become a CenturyLink customer, you are automatically signed up to receive these e-mails. We do not provide your e-mail address to third parties for the marketing of third-party products without your consent.</p>

			<p>If you are a CenturyLink customer, to update your e-mail address for special offers and products, or to stop receiving e-mails about specials on products and services, log in to "My Account," select "Account Profile" in the left navigation menu, and under "Your e-mail preferences," select the link that matches your preference. If you would like to enroll or learn about the benefits of My Account, read our <a href="/Pages/Support/HelpAndFAQ/" alt="FAQ's" target="_blank">FAQs</a> or <a href="/Pages/MyAccount/loginForm.jsp" alt="My Account enroll now" target="_blank">enroll now</a>. If you are not enrolled for My Account, and wish to stop receiving emails about CenturyLink products and services specials, <a href="/emailEnrollment.html" alt="unsubscribe here" target="_blank">unsubscribe here</a>.</p>

			<p><b>Our policy on online access by children</b><br> 
			CenturyLink Web sites are not designed to attract children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifying information from anyone under the age of 18. CenturyLink comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which requires the consent of a parent or guardian for the collection of personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.</p>

			<p>Ordering online products and services from CenturyLink is limited to adults (age 18 or over or as otherwise legally defined).</p>

			<p><b>Links to other Web sites</b><br>
			This Web site and other CenturyLink Web sites may provide links to Web sites maintained by third parties. We provide these links for your convenience. The Company makes no endorsements or representations regarding the content, security or privacy of any third-party Web site.</p>

			<h3>How We Protect Your Information</h3>
			<p>As stated above, CenturyLink respects and is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers.

			</ul>
