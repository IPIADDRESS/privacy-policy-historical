			<h3>Collection of Data</h3>
			
			<p>As a general rule, you can visit this Web Site without revealing personal information about yourself (i.e., information that identifies you). However, some parts of our Web Site may be accessible to you only if you register with us and, if you choose to register with us, you may be asked to provide CenturyTel with personal information. You also may be requested to provide personal information when you access your account online, order a service, make a payment online, request product or service information, send us e-mail, register to receive news, participate in an online survey, or enter a contest. The types of personal information you provide to us may include name, address, phone number, e-mail address, user IDs and passwords, billing and transaction information, credit card information, and contact preferences.</p>

			<h3>How We Use the Data We Collect</h3>
			
			<p><b>Personal Information:</b> CenturyTel uses personal information to better understand your needs and interests, and to provide you with better service. Once you choose to provide us with personal information, you can be assured it will be used only to support your customer relationship with us, and we will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to others.</p>
			
			<p>When you supply information about yourself for a specific purpose, we use the information for that purpose. For example, we use your information to help you complete a transaction or order, to communicate with you, to provide service and support, or to update you on services and benefits. We also may use your personal information for the following general purposes:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>To help us deliver the services you have requested.</li>
			  <li>To design or offer specific products or services that we believe will be useful to you.</li>
			  <li>To send you information about our company and some of our partners.</li>
			  <li>To manage and upgrade this Web site.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The decision to provide us with your personal information is purely voluntary, and you will be provided with an opportunity to decline to provide your personal information each time we request it.</p>
			
			<p>CenturyTel also uses e-mail to provide you with information about your service, or to inform you of products, new offers, and special promotions we think might interest you. Please see our section on <a href="#5">Opting Out</a> for more information.</p>
			
			<p><b>Non-personal Information:</b> This information is data about usage and service operation that is not associated with a specific personal identity. CenturyTel collects and analyzes non-personal information to evaluate how visitors use our Web site. Non-personal data we collect may include the pages visited on the site, unique URLs visited within centurytel.com, browser type, and IP address. Most non-personal data is collected via cookies or other analysis technologies. Our Web pages use cookies, statistics tracking, and other technologies for data analysis and personalization services.</p>

			<h3>Who We Share Your Information With</h3>
			
			<p>We are committed to our customers, and we will not share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties without your permission, except under the following circumstances:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>We may disclose your personal information if we are required to do so by law.</li>
			  <li>We may disclose your personal information to law enforcement authorities if it is believed in good faith that such action is necessary to protect public safety or to protect the employees and property of CenturyTel.</li>
			  <li>We may disclose your personal information to companies and vendors that perform marketing or other services on our behalf.</li>
			  <li>We may disclose your personal information to unaffiliated companies and vendors, when necessary, to provide a service that you requested.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>When we disclose your personal information to unaffiliated third parties, it is our policy to provide third parties only with the information they need, and to prohibit them from otherwise selling or disclosing the personal information we provide.</p>

			<h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
			
			<p>CenturyTel collects information about your computer hardware and software -- for example, your IP address, domain name, and access times -- using "cookies." Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a visitor's computer.</p>
			
			<p>We, or a third party acting on our behalf, may use cookies to tailor and improve the content we deliver to our Web visitors, to improve our Web site by assessing which areas, features, and products are most popular, and to personalize our Web site and make recommendations based on information, including product choices, a particular visitor has previously provided. For example, we may use a cookie to identify your phone number so we do not ask you to enter it more than once. We also use cookies to store user preferences, complete online order activity and keep track of transactions.</p>
			
			<p>We, or a third party acting on our behalf, may use Web beacons in certain of our Web pages and e-mails to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and e-mail correspondence. For example, we may use Web beacons in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by the recipients.</p>
			
			<p>You can configure your Web browser to alert you when a Web site is attempting to send a cookie to your computer and allow you to accept or refuse the cookie. You can also set your browser to disable the capacity to receive cookies or you can delete cookies previously accepted. Some CenturyTel web pages (and other Web pages) may not work correctly if you have cookies disabled.</p>
			
			<p>We may use advertising companies to deliver ads for CenturyTel-offered services and products on our Web sites or on third party Web sites. These Internet ads are often called "banner ads" and may contain third-party cookies or Web beacons that allow tracking of visitors' responses to our advertisements. Although these third parties may receive anonymous Web usage information about ad viewing on such Web sites, we prohibit them from using this information for any purpose other than to assist us in measuring the effectiveness of our ads.</p>
			
			<p>When you interact with our Web site, we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. Our site uses session cookies to track Web visitor behavior and to allow our customers to immediately save their User IDs, as well as personal settings on specific pages. This allows us to process your information and quickly log you into the product. Session cookies also help us make sure you are who you say you are after you have logged in.</p>
			
			<p>We use persistent cookies that only CenturyTel can read and use, to identify the fact that you are either a CenturyTel customer, or a prior CenturyTel Web site visitor. We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will still be able to browse our Web site; however, they may lose some of the functionality provided by the use of persistent cookies.</p>
			
			<p>You can prevent our site from using cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being used by following the instructions below. However, cookies must be enabled for My Account to function properly. Instructions on enabling and disabling cookies are listed below.</p>
