<br>
7. <strong>Your Rights.</strong><br>
<br>
7.1 <u>Personal Data.</u> Provided that we have allowed for account features on the Site you are visiting, and you have established an account on such Site, we provide access to—and the ability to edit or delete—certain categories of Personal Data through the account.<br>
If you would like to access, amend, erase, export (i.e., data portability), or object to or restrict the processing of Personal Data collected via our Site, you may submit a request to <a href="mailto:info@cenveo.com">compliance.contact@cenveo.com</a> or write to us at:<br>
Cenveo, Inc.<br>

Stamford, CT 06902<br>
We will promptly review all such requests in accordance with applicable laws.&nbsp;<br>
Depending on where you live, you may have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority or other regulatory agency if you believe that we have violated any of the rights concerning Personal Data about you.&nbsp; We encourage you to first reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@cenveo.com">compliance.contact@cenveo.com</a> so that we have an opportunity to address your concerns directly before you file a complaint.<br>
<br>
7.2.&nbsp;<u>Opting-Out of Promotional Emails</u>.&nbsp;You may choose not to receive future promotional or advertising emails from us by selecting an unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email that you receive from us, or by responding to the emails directly and requesting removal if such a link is not available. Additionally, you may send a request specifying your communications preferences to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@cenveo.com">compliance.contact@cenveo.com</a>. Customers cannot opt out of receiving transactional emails related to their account with us or our services. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving the foregoing emails, we may still send you a response to any "Contact Us" request as well as administrative, maintenance and operational emails (for example, in connection with a password reset request).<br>
<br>
8.&nbsp; <strong>Personal Data Transferred from the EU or Switzerland To The United States.</strong><br>
Cenveo complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework&nbsp; (collectively, “Privacy Shield”) as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union (the “EU”) member countries and Switzerland. Cenveo has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability. A violation of our commitment to Privacy Shield may be investigated by the Federal Trade Commission and/or the United States Department of Commerce. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, to the extent available, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov.<br>
<br>
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Cenveo commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of Personal Data about you. Persons from the EU or Switzerland who have inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy should first contact us via email at: <a href="mailto:info@cenveo.com">compliance.contact@cenveo.com</a>.<br>
<br>
Cenveo has committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information and to file a complaint.<br>
<br>
These recourse mechanisms are available at no cost to you. Damages may be awarded in accordance with applicable law. Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the Privacy Shield, Cenveo is potentially liable.<br>
<br>
9.&nbsp;<strong>Data</strong> <strong>Security.</strong>&nbsp;<br>
The security of Personal Data is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br>
<br>
10.&nbsp;<strong>Children's Privacy.</strong>&nbsp;<br>
Our Site is not intended for children under the age of 18. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Data from anyone we know to be under 18 years of age.<br>
<br>
11.&nbsp;<strong>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals.</strong>&nbsp;<br>
Cenveo does not track Site users over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising. Accordingly, we do not currently respond or take any action with respect to web browser "do not track" signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of Personal Data about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services.<br>
<br>
12. <strong>Your California Privacy Rights.</strong><br>
If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of Personal Data about you by Cenveo to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
