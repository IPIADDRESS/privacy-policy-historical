<br>

<br>

<p>Where you or the company you represent have opted-in to receive such communications we may send you information about our products and services. You may “unsubscribe” link found on the bottom of such communications or contact your account manager.</p>
<br>

<h2><a name="6"></a>6. Sharing of your data</h2>
<p>Occasions will arise when Registry client or Registrar information is passed outside of CentralNic to other data processors (e.g. fulfilment companies, database consultants etc.) but they will only act upon instruction from CentralNic in order to perform the services required and their contracts are subject to the terms of this privacy policy or compliant with the GDPR.</p>

<p>CentralNic only shares information as described in this Privacy Policy. We require third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<p>To the extent permitted by law, your personal data may be disclosed to the following third parties:</p>

<ul class="bullets">
	<li>Any member of our group companies affiliated with ourselves or our holding Company CentralNic Group plc</li>
	<li>Third party service providers we have contracted to provide some of the services you have been requested.</li>

	<li>Third-party payment providers directly involved in the provision of payment services for payment facilities chosen by you to pay for our services, such as a banks, credit card service providers, Paypal and others. This may require the transfer of your personal data to organisations and/or servers located outside the European Union and the European Economic Area.</li>

	<li>Your personal data may be provided to escrow service providers as well as to backup storage providers to ensure business continuity.</li>

	<li>Law enforcement agencies, to other government and/or civil authorities similarly authorised by applicable laws and regulations and to courts of appropriate jurisdiction if so required by law. To ensure data accuracy and to prevent abusive use of our services, we may use third-party verification service providers to check the data you have provided. To assess our business operations, we may also provide access to your data to our auditors.</li>

	<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.</li>

	<li>If applicable, your personal data may be provided to operators of registration database (formerly whois) services and the users of such services if required and such provision and use is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by them or by a third party.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2><a name="7"></a>7. Transfers of Data</h2>
<p>Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Many of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>

<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>

<ul class="bullets">
	<li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.</li>
	<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</li>
	<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2><a name="8"></a>8. Data Security</h2>
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<br>

<h2><a name="9"></a>9. Data Retention</h2>
<h3>How long do we retain your information?</h3>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.  If we have your data because we are preforming services for you or an organisation you represent then your information will be retained for the duration of the services and for 6 years thereafter, unless otherwise agreed.</p>
<p>If you are employed by CentralNic we will retain such data as required for as long as you are an employee with CentralNic and for three years after termination.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<br>

<h2><a name="10"></a>10. Your rights and how to access your data</h2>
<p>All information that CentralNic has collected is available online in your account and you may access such information at any time by logging in to your account.</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data:</p>

<p><b>Request access</b> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to access information we hold about you and receive information about how we process it.</p>

<p><b>Request correction</b> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us to protect your security and comply with our data accuracy policies.</p>

<p><b>Request erasure</b> of your personal data. You may request to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reasons for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>

<p><b>Object to processing</b> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>

<p><b>Request restriction of processing</b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in such limited circumstances as: where you wish to cancel all services, and close your accounts; or where you need us to hold the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims when we would normally delete or anonymise the data.</p>

<p><b>Request the transfer</b> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will allow you to copy your information held by us. If you wish to transfer domain names to another registrar please login and go to the “Manage Transfers” tab on the website.</p>

<p><b>Withdraw consent at any time</b> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>

<p><b>Automated decision-making</b> Other than the use of cookies, logs and web beacons, set out above which are automated on the website, we do not use automated profiling or decision making based upon your personal information in providing you with services. We will not contact you solely as a result of visiting our website.</p>

<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please log in to your account or contact us on <a href="mailto:info@centralnic.com">info@centralnic.com</a></p>

<h3>Further Information</h3>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>

<h3>Time to respond</h3>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made several requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

<h2><a name="11"></a>11. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Due to changes in legislation and best practice or enhancements to functionality and content on CentralNic.com we may make changes to our privacy policy and will reflect those changes in this statement, so please check here from time to time.
