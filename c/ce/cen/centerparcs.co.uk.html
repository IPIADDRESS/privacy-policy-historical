Center Parcs Limited and its parent, subsidiary and associated companies are committed to respecting your privacy. We have structured our web site so that, in general, you can visit the Center Parcs web site without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Once you choose to provide us with any information by which you can be identified, then you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.<br>

WHO WE SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH AND YOUR CHOICES<br>
It is essential for us to pass on certain details to subcontracted companies or organisations in order that your break or related services can be provided, for example, to send out brochures or arrival packs. When you make a brochure request or booking this means that you consent to our passing on such details to our subcontractors.<br>
When you use this site and provide personal information, you are agreeing that we may transfer, disclose, sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties (in addition to our authorised direct marketing agents and our subsidiary, parent or associated companies) unless you tell us that you do not wish this to happen.<br>
When you provide any information on line, you should look for the box that you can click to say that you do not want the information to be used by anyone for direct marketing purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have not previously objected to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by writing to or e-mailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:data.protection@centerparcs.co.uk" target="_blank">data.protection@centerparcs.co.uk</a>&nbsp;<br>

We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The type of information we collect includes the pages visited, a booking and value of the booking. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of this website analysis tool by clicking here&nbsp;<a href="http://centerparcs.112.2o7.net/optout.html" target="_blank">http://centerparcs.112.2o7.net/optout.html</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better web site, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not.&nbsp;&nbsp; A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.&nbsp;&nbsp; This practice is strictly in force.&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that people have concerns about cookies, but we believe that the benefit we both gain from their proper use is worthwhile.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may set your web browser (Microsoft internet explorer or Netscape navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests or decline cookies completely.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can delete the files that contain cookies - those files are stored as part of your internet browser.<br></p><p><br>
