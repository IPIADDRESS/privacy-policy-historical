<center><h2>U.S. Census Bureau<br>
On-line Privacy Policy</h2></center>
This World Wide Web (WWW) site is provided as a public service by the U.S. Census Bureau.
The privacy of our respondents and customers is paramount in any Census Bureau undertaking.
Our concern for that privacy has not diminished with the advent of the Internet and other
electronic forms of communication. 
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>      The Census Bureau web server collects and saves only the default information
          customarily logged by World Wide Web server software. Specifically, for each
          http request received we log the following:  the date and time, the originating IP
          address, the object requested, and the completion status of the request.
<p>
</p></li><li>      These logs are reviewed regularly to determine the traffic through the server
          during the last reporting period in hits, the number of pages served, and the level
          of demand for pages of interest.
<p>
</p></li><li>      We do not give, share, sell or transfer any personal information to a third party.
<p>
</p></li><li>      The logs may be preserved indefinitely, and used at any time and in any way
          necessary to prevent security breaches and to ensure the integrity of the data on
          our servers.
<p>
</p></li><li>      We generally do not use cookies, but processes (such as on-line purchases of Census Bureau products) might require their use.
          (A cookie is a file placed on your hard drive by a Web site, usually without your knowledge.)
<p>
</p></li><li>      We do not seek or collect any other data related to specific users of this server.
<p>
          Email to the Bureau of the Census and data explicitly submitted to the Bureau
          through the filling-out of on-line forms (e.g., for the ordering of Census
          publications or other data products) is handled and saved in accordance with the
          Privacy Act of 1974.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>     Questions concerning this policy may be addressed  to:
      webmaster@census.gov,  attn: Policy Office.
