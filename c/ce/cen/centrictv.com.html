<h3>CENTRICTV.COM PRIVACY POLICY</h3>   
    	<div>
    <p>
       <b>Your Privacy Rights</b>
        <b>
            <br>
        </b>
        This document is a privacy policy for CentricTv.com ("CentricTV.com," "we," "us," or "our"), an internet site offered in connection with the Centric
        television channel or programming service (the "Centric Channel"). The Centric Channel and CentricTV.com is a division of Black Entertainment
        Television LLC (d/b/a Bet Networks), a subsidiary of Viacom Inc. CentricTV.com supports a general policy of openness about personal data collection and
        use. We have adopted and implemented this Privacy Policy as part of our commitment to protecting our users' personally identifiable information from
        misuse.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>
        The phrase "personally identifiable information" as used in CentricTV.com's Privacy Policy means any information such as a user's full name, street
        address, town or city, state, zip code, telephone number, date of birth, e-mail address and any other information that would allow someone to identify
        or contact a CentricTV.com user.
        
    </p>

    <p>
       <b>Your California Privacy Rights.</b>
        <b>
            <br>
        </b>
        Users who reside in California can prevent future disclosures of his or her personally identifiable information, at no charge, by exercising his or her
        "opt out" rights by using the "opt out" procedures described below:
        
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>
        1. You can send email to: <a href="mailto:contactus@bet.com">contactus@bet.com</a> or
        <br>
        2. You can send mail to the following postal address:
        
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>
        CentricTV.com, a division of
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Black EntertainmentTelevisionLLC
        <br>
        OneBETPlaza
        <br>
        1235 W Street, NE
        <br>
        Washington, DC 20018
        <br>
        Attn: General Counsel
        
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, upon receipt of any communication from CentricTV.com, to unsubscribe from future communications, you can click on the link that says "If
        you do not wish to receive these emails in the future, You can click here to unsubscribe."
        
    </p>

    <p>
        Because CentricTV.com provides its California users with the ability to exercise his or her "opt out" rights as described above, pursuant to Section
        1798.83 (c)(2) of the California Civil Code, CentricTV.com is in compliance with the California "Shine the Light" law and is not obligated to provide
        California users with the names and addresses of all the third parties that received personal information from CentricTV.com for the third parties'
        direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.
        
    </p>

    <p>
        Please be aware that other websites that may be accessed through our site (including stores listed on CentricTV.com) may collect personally
        identifiable information about you. The information practices of those websites linked to CentricTV.com are governed by the privacy policies of those
        websites and are not covered by this privacy statement, and CentricTV.com is not responsible for any information that you provide when you access those
        websites.
        
    </p>

    <p>
       <b>What information does CentricTV.com collect?</b>
        <br>
        Some functions, as well as some areas of CentricTV.com, require users to register before they can use or access a particular area of the site (which
        may be necessary for identification, security, or marketing purposes, etc.). CentricTV.com's registration, online surveys, contest entry forms, and
        specialized services may call for users to provide personally identifiable information and demographic information (like their age or income level).
        Additionally, CentricTV.com's registration process requires users to choose a user ID and password. Users may change his or her password, as well as
        any personally identifiable information provided to us to keep his or her registration information current.
        
    </p>

    <p>
        We use the standard "cookie" feature of major browser applications to allow us to store data about your visit (such data is stored in the aggregate
        form). Cookies help us learn which areas of our site are useful and which areas need improvement. We may use cookies in a number of ways, including
        keeping track of user return visits to CentricTV.com or our advertisers' or business partners' websites; accumulating and reporting aggregate,
        statistical information in connection with CentricTV.com user visits; and to deliver to our users content specific to their interests; to save users
        ID, passwords, or other information so users don't have to re-enter it each time they visit our site. We also may use cookies to track visits to track
        your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.
        
    </p>

    <p>
        Advertisements displayed on CentricTV.com, and links to other websites may also contain cookies. We may also use third parties to display or serve
        advertising on CentricTV.com and to distribute our emails or newsletters. These third party companies may employ cookie and other technologies to
        measure advertising effectiveness. You should be aware that different rules may apply to the collection, or use of the personally identifiable
        information you disclose to these third parties.
        
    </p>

    <p>
        CentricTV.com may also gather anonymous information, which may be used by us or shared with third parties. This is information which does not
        personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. For example, we might tell our
        advertisers how many users visited a particular advertisement, and how long, so they can measure whether the ad worked. This information is also used
        to generate advertising rates. Generally this information is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of numeric codes used to identify
        a computer.
        
    </p>

    <p>
       <b>What does CentricTV.com do with collected information?</b>
        <br>
        CentricTV.com's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide the user, with a customized experience on our site. This includes
        personalization services, interactive communications, and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to our users. In order to
        provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about users, CentricTV.com is able to deliver more relevant
        advertisements and content, and hence better service, to our users.
        
    </p>

    <p>
        We use personally identifiable information from our online registration, surveys, contests, specialized services, and order forms for our own internal
        evaluation and tracking purposes and to send our users information from our company (e.g., site announcements, newsletters, and message notifications)
        and promotional material from some of our business partners (or from other companies). If you supply such personally identifiable information, it may
        also be used to contact you about products and services in which you have indicated an interest, and may be shared with our third party advertisers,
        business partners, or other companies who may want to contact you, if you have provided your consent through an "opt in" (in which case their use of
        your personally identifiable information is subject to such third party's privacy policy). Additionally, you may opt out of receiving future mailings
        by using the "opt out" procedures described below - see the Choice/Opt-Out section below.
        
    </p>

    <p>
        In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, CentricTV.com plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of
        audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). CentricTV.com takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting those
        criteria. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional emails.
        
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, CentricTV.com uses Doubleclick, Inc. ("Doubleclick") as a third party ad serving company, to serve certain advertisements to you when you
        visit CentricTV.com. Doubleclick and other third party ad serving companies may use anonymous information related to your visit to CentricTV.com, such
        as the number of times you visited an advertisement, to better provide advertisements to you about goods and services that may be of interest to you.
        CentricTV.com's privacy policy covers the use of cookies by CentricTV.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by our third party ad serving
        companies.
        
    </p>

    <p>
        As always, we only authorize our third party ad serving companies to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. Additionally, we
        do not give our third party ad serving companies any personally identifying information about you. If you would like more information about your
        ability to opt-out of the use of cookies, or to prevent our third party ad serving companies from setting and/or reading cookies on your computer, or
        to know more about their information gathering practices and procedures, you may visit each ad serving companies' website and opt-out or visit the
        Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") gateway opt-out site to opt-out of all participating network advertising cookies. Click here for the NAI gateway
        opt-out site <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.

        CentricTV.com may use users' IP address (the number assigned to your computer while it is on the Internet) for our internal purposes to help diagnose
        problems with our server, and to administer our site. In addition, your IP address is transmitted with each message sent from your account. We may also
        store communicative information including, without limitation, instant messages and submissions to personal profiles or other social networking
        communications tools for the purpose of delivering and, if needed, monitoring communications.
        
    </p>

    <p>
        Demographic and profile data from online forms or cookies may be used to tailor your experience at our site, showing you content that we think you
        might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. This information may be shared with our third party advertisers,
        business partners, or other companies only on an aggregate basis, unless you expressly state through an opt-out that demographic and profile
        information about you may not be disclosed.
        
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition, CentricTV.com uses a third party service provider, Social Project, Inc. ("SP"), to perform functions on our behalf for the purpose of
        administering and maintaining certain social networking services, content, features, functions, and other operations of the CentricTV.com site. SP will
        also manage and store all CentricTV.com user information, including your personally identifiable information. <b> </b>Your voluntary use of, or
        registration for participation on CentricTV.com, means that you opt-in and give your consent to both CentricTV.com and SP to collect and use your
        personally identifiable information in connection with providing the services, content, features, functions, and other operations provided on
        CentricTV.com, as well as for marketing or administrative purposes. If you would like more information about the information gathering practices and
        procedures of SP, please click here:

        and you will not be able to register or continue to log-in to the CentricTV.com site.
