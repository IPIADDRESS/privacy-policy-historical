CentricTV.com’s registration, online surveys, contest entry forms, mobile applications and specialized services may call for users to provide Personal Information and demographic information (like their age or income level).

<p><b>iv.&nbsp; Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.&nbsp; </b>Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the browser communicates.&nbsp; Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.&nbsp; There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.&nbsp; Instead, as described above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for online behavioral advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described in Sections 8(b)(i), (ii) and (iii).<b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b>9.&nbsp; Children/Ineligible Teenagers.</b></p>
<p>CentricTV.com is a general audience site. We do not direct any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from anyone under 13 years of age. If a parent or guardian believes that CentricTV.com collected Personal Information from a child, please see the Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information Section.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the event that we, or our Parent Companies, subsidiaries or Affiliates, unknowingly send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site (“Ineligible Teenagers”), the child or Ineligible Teenager or the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s parent or legal guardian (“Parents”) always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message. The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s membership must use their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID to gain direct access to the account and follow the procedures below. To terminate a child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s membership, Parents may send an email to the Site’s Privacy Administrator at legal@bet.com and provide us with your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID and request to terminate your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user’s account and Personal Information by any person without the user’s User ID. If a Parent does not have his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID, the Parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator at legal@bet.com that includes the Parent’s name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s date of birth. The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that he or she is the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. CentricTV.com will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration. The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. CentricTV.com will then terminate the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.</p>

<p><b>d. Use of Information.</b> CentricTV.com will not use a wireless telephone number or email address, or other Personal Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use or as stated in the Privacy Policy or the <a href="http://www.centrictv.com/Site/TermsOfService/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Terms of Use Agreement.</a> We will not share such Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure.

These service providers may also manage and store Site user information, including your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal information. Your voluntary use of, or registration for participation on the Site, means that you opt-in and give your consent to both CentricTV.com and its authorized agents or third party service providers to collect and use your Personal Information in connection with providing the services, content, features, functions, and other operations provided on the Site, as well as for marketing or administrative purposes.

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we believe your actions violate any law, regulation, the Terms of Use Agreement, this Privacy Policy, or any Additional Terms or Rules, offerings or any other services, features or functions of the Site, or if you threaten the rights, property or safety of the Site, CentricTV.com, its parent companies, subsidiaries, Affiliates, or any of its or their Operational Service Providers, licensors, suppliers, Advertisers, customers, users, or any other party;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, (i) to protect CentricTV.com or our parent companies, subsidiaries, Affiliates, licensors, suppliers, Advertisers, customers and other users and our security, business, property and/or assets, (ii) to limit legal liability, (iii) to defend our interests and/or (iv) to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations or requests by law enforcement agencies or governmental authorities; or</p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>15.&nbsp; Security &amp; Protection of Personal Information.</b><br>
 We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be 100% secure. For most Internet sites, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, CentricTV.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.</p>

However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information. Deletion or attempted deletion of certain Personal Information, such as your user name, may not be permitted and/or may result in suspension of your account or termination of any registration you may have made. <br>
