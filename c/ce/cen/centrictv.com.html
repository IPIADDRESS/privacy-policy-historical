	 Site (which may be necessary for identification, security, or marketing purposes, etc.).  CentricTV.com's registration, online surveys, contest entry forms, mobile applications

	 <b>Cookies.</b>

	<p>
     We use the standard "cookie" or "web beacon" features of major browser applications to allow us to store data about your visit, including the collection of your IP address
	 or other such identifiers associated with the Device you use to access the Site. Cookies help us learn which areas of the Site are useful and which areas need improvement.
	 We may use cookies in a number of ways, including personalizing your experience with the Site; keeping track of user return visits to the Site or our Advertisers' or
	 business partners' websites; accumulating and reporting aggregate, statistical information in connection with CentricTV.com user visits; delivering to our users content 
	 specific to their interests; and saving users' ID, passwords, or other information so users don't have to re-enter it each time they visit the Site.  We also may use 
	 cookies to track visits and to track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. By visiting the Site, whether as a registered
	 user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site through use of cookies,
	 web beacons or other similar tracking technologies.
    </p>
	<p>
	 Advertisements displayed on the Site, and links to other websites, may also contain cookies. We may also use third parties to display or serve advertising on the Site and to
     distribute our emails or newsletters.  These third party companies may employ cookies and other technologies to measure advertising effectiveness. You should be aware that 
	 different rules may apply to the collection or use of the Personal Information you disclose to these third parties. Even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do
	 not control those sites or their technologies, policies, and practices regarding your Personal Information.<u>This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Personal Information
	 that a third party Advertiser or ad server may collect from you.</u>  Use of Advertisers' tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies and terms of service.  
	</p>
	<p>
	 We may also gather anonymous information, which may be used by us or shared with third parties. This is information which does not personally identify you, but which may be 
	 helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. For example, we might tell our Advertisers how many users visited a particular advertisement, and how long,
	 so they can measure whether the ad worked. This information is also used to generate advertising rates. Generally this information is collected through "traffic data" and may
	 entail the use of numeric codes used to identify a computer.

	<b>Targeted Advertising.</b>
    In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, CentricTV.com plays the middleman.
	Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old).
	CentricTV.com takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting those criteria. This kind of advertisement targeting is done 
	with banner ads as well as promotional emails.
    </p>
    <p> 
	  <br>
	Additionally, CentricTV.com uses 24/7 Real Media, Inc. and Doubleclick, Inc. ("Doubleclick") as third party ad serving companies, 
    to serve certain advertisements to you when you visit the Site.  These companies may use anonymous information related to your visit
	to the Site, such as the number of times you visited an advertisement, to better provide advertisements to you about goods and services
	that may be of interest to you.

    CentricTV.com is a general audience site. We do not direct any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information
	from anyone under 13 years of age. If a parent or guardian believes that CentricTV.com collected Personal Information from a child, please see the Review, Update or Delete Your Personal
	Information Section.

   <p>
     <br>
   In the event that we, or our parent companies, subsidiaries or Affiliates, unknowingly send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements
   of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site ("Ineligible Teenagers"), the child or
   Ineligible Teenager or the child's or Ineligible Teenager's parent or legal guardian ("Parents") always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via
   the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message. The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).

   <p>
    <br>
    Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's membership must use their child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID to gain direct access to the account
	and follow the procedures below. To terminate a child's or Ineligible Teenager's membership, Parents may send an email to the Site's Privacy Administrator at legal@bet.com and provide us with your child's or
	Ineligible Teenager's User ID and request to terminate your child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user's account and Personal Information by any person
	without the user's User ID. If a Parent does not have his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID, the Parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator at legal@bet.com that includes
	the Parent's name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child's or Ineligible Teenager's name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child's or Ineligible Teenager's date of birth.
	The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that he or she is the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. CentricTV.com will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address
	provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address.
	CentricTV.com will then terminate the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.
