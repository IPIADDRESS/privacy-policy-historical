<ul>
	<li>As long as you continue to log into our website or use our services (including engaging with emails, entering cycling events or downloading content) we will retain and process information about you. &nbsp;&nbsp;In such cases, you will be considered to be an ‘active’ customer. &nbsp;If you have not been ‘active’ as a customer for a period of three years, CTT will deactivate your customer account and subject to the data retention periods referred to below anonymise any personal data relating to you.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Any data relating to the obligations of CTT to maintain a comprehensive, published index of results as a National Governing Body for time trialling will be retained. &nbsp;This would not include more than name, age or age category, gender, and name of the club affiliated to CTT of which the individual is a member; alongside details of the event in which an individual took part.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Personal data linked to the processing of insurance claims, subject access requests, disputes, safeguarding investigations, anti-doping, disciplinary or police matters will only be kept for as long as it necessary for those purposes, as each is applicable.</li>
	<li>Personal data provided by you when entering a time trial held under the rules and regulations of CTT normally will be retained for a period of four years following the date of the event and in the event of an accident in an event involving a competitor who is aged under 18 years for the period of four years from and including that competitor’s 18th birthday.&nbsp; This is needed should there be a claim made against a competitor or other person associated with such event.</li>
</ul>
