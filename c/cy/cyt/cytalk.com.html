                                        <h3>Browsing</h3>

                                        We may offer links to other websites. If you visit one of these websites, you may want to review the Privacy Statement on that website. In addition, you may have visited our websites through a link or a banner advertisement on another website. In such cases, the websites you linked from may collect personal information from people who click on the banner or link. You may want to refer to the Privacy Policies on those websites to see how they collect and use this information. We also may retain a copy of that personal information.


                                        <h3>Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies</h3>

                                        Like most other websites, we use cookies. A cookie is a small text file that contains information that a website stores on your computer and which it can later retrieve.  Cookies, web beacons and similar technologies allow our servers to anonymously compile usage information to generate statistics about the general operation and use of websites. Cookies may also be used to recognize you as a returning websites visitor or our consumer, and for a faster and safer experience. We also use Cookies to identify you as a valid user who has logged into our websites, so that you will not be forced to re-enter your password multiple times while using our websites. Cookies may also be used for advertising purposes. We encourage you to review your computer setting to ensure your Cookie preferences are properly configured, such as warning you before accepting a Cookie or blocking unwanted Cookies. If you are uncomfortable with the use of cookies, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. Certain of our services, however, could be dependent on cookies and you may disable entirely or partially those services by refusing cookies. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of our features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. We may work with third-party providers, who are authorized to place third-party cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies for storing information on our websites or in our services, with our permission. These service providers help us to enhance your experience.


                                        <h3>Privacy Practices of Third Parties</h3>

                                        Our websites, mobile and desktop applications may contain links to third party websites. Please, be aware, however, that we are not responsible for and cannot control the Privacy Statements of these other websites or their practices. We encourage you to read the Privacy Statements for these other websites, as they may differ from ours. This Privacy Statement applies solely to personal information collected by us. We are not responsible for the content or information practices used by other websites that are linked to or from our websites, mobile and desktop applications. In most cases, links are provided as pointers to information or services that may be useful to you. These websites are governed by their own Privacy Statements and you are encouraged to review their Privacy Statements before providing them with personal information.


                                        <h3>Data Security</h3>

                                        Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution every person has the right to privacy for their mail and telecommunications and the right to be protected against the misuse of their personal data. The information collected and stored by us will be treated as confidential and is protected by means of appropriate technical and organisational measures against loss and alteration as well as against unauthorised access by third parties. We use industry standard methods and security measures to safeguard the information we collected. The access to this information is restricted to employees and service providers that need to require access, as described in this Privacy Statement. Login information will be sent in encrypted form between your computer and us.


                                        <h3>Use by Children</h3>

                                        Our websites, CPE, mobile and desktop applications, and our services are not for use by children under the age of 13. We will not knowingly collect personal information from children without the consent of a parent or legal guardian.

                                        <h3>Acquisitions, Mergers, and Bankruptcy</h3>

                                        If we should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if we should decide to buy another business, or sell or reorganize part or all of our business, we may be required to disclose your personal information to prospective or actual purchasers and other parties. It is our practice to obtain appropriate protections for information disclosed in these types of transactions. We cannot, however, guarantee that our Privacy Statement will remain unchanged if we are sold or merge with another company.


                                        <h3>Privacy Statement Revisions</h3>

                                        We may amend this Privacy Statement at any time by posting the amended terms on our websites, mobile and desktop applications, and authorised points of sales. Because we continue to develop our websites, mobile and desktop applications, and authorised points of sales and take advantage of technologies to improve the services we provide, we will regularly review our Privacy Statement. As a result, this Privacy Statement may change from time to time in the future. You agree to revisit this page regularly and your continued use of our websites, CPE, mobile and desktop applications, authorised points of sales and services indicate your acceptance of the changes. Our websites, mobile and desktop applications, and authorised points of sales will always contain the most current Privacy Statement.
