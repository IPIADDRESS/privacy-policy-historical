	<h1>Cylive Privacy Policy</h1>
 <h2>March 1st, 2006 </h2>
 <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
 <h3>Personal Information</h3>
 <p>Cylive collects some personal
       information, including email addresses, when individuals register to use
   the Cylive website and services, post a link to the Cylive website or submit
   questions, comments or bug reports. We may also, at times, collect our users'
   IP addresses and information regarding our users' use of our website and services.
   We may use such IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers, track
   movement within our website and, if necessary, deny service in accordance
   with our <a href="/help/terms.html">Terms of Use </a>. We may also collect
   information related to the referring URL, access times and browser type. Unless
   required by law, we will not share our users' personal information, Internet
   Protocol (IP) addresses and usage information, except in aggregate or anonymous
   form, with third parties. </p>
 <p>In order to offer and provide optimized and personalized services, we use
  cookies to store and sometimes track information about our users. A cookie
  is a small amount of data that is sent to a user's browser from a web server
and is eventually stored on a user's computer hard drive.</p>
 <h3>Uses</h3>
 <p>Cylive stores and maintains your account information and the content that
   you create on various database in order to provide the service. The content
   of data may be fed to computer algorithms to better target the advertising
   content. </p>
 <h3>Your choices</h3>
 <p>You can change your account and profile settings to not publish your information
   on publicly accessible areas of the website. You have the ability to modify
   and remove content that you create. Once you modify or remove your content,
   residual copies of such content may reside for an indefinite time on backup
   storage.</p>
 <p>Our services give you the opportunity
     to opt-in to receive communications from us. We will never automatically
   send you information/offers you do not want. You must choose to receive them.</p>
 <p>If your account
   is reported to be abusing the services in a manner that is inconsistent with
   the law, we will take any appropriate measures to protect other users of
   the service upon validation of such claims. Such violations, along with your
   information could also be reported to authorities.</p>
 <h3>More information </h3>
 <p>Cylive reserves the right to modify all or some of this Privacy Policy
    at any time without notice. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post a
    notice on our website so our users are aware of what information we collect,
    how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will
    use information only in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the
    information was collected unless we have received explicit authorization from
    the appropriate user(s) to do otherwise.</p>
 <p>If Cylive becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale
   of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information
   is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
 <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this
  website or your dealings with  Cylive, you can send an e-mail, in
  English, to <a href="mailto:privacy@cylive.com">privacy@cylive.com</a>.</p>
