<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>Through cookies we place on your mobile device or browser, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave or log out from our Products and Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve our Products and Services and to customise your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Policy. Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognise your device and to improve your overall user experience. For instance, cookies allow us to preserve our users’ preferences and record session information, such as what pages a visit or items the user looks at, recognise the user’s browser or device type, and determine which pages and/or features are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from using some features or functionality of our Products and Services.</p>
<p>Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option which allows&nbsp;you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioural advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Currently our Products and Services do not monitor, support or take any action with respect to “Do Not Track” requests, signals or mechanisms, which means that we may collect information about your online activity both while you are using and after you have finished using our website(s), Products and Services.</p>
<p><strong>Is your Information secure?</strong></p>
<p>Protecting your privacy is important to us, which is why we endeavour to protect the security of your privacy and personal information using commercially reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality and security of the Information that we hold, and we update these from time to time to address new and emerging security threats that we become aware of.</p>
<p>We also take steps to monitor access to and modification of your Information by our staff members, and ensure that they are aware of and are properly trained in their obligations for managing your data privacy.</p>
<p>No website or Internet transmission is completely secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that your Information will never be hacked or that your Information is free from unauthorised access, data loss, or other breaches. In other words, your use of CyberMiles’ Products and Services is at your own risk. We encourage you to exercise caution when using our Products and Services by keeping your password safe and not sharing it with other individuals.</p>
<p><strong>How do we store your Information and how long do we keep it? </strong></p>
<p>We generally store the Information that we collect in electronic databases, some of which may be held on our behalf by third party data storage providers. Sometimes we also keep hard copy records of your Information in physical storage facilities.</p>
<p>Your Personal Information will not be kept longer than required. We may retain your Personal Information for a period of 12 months. We may be required (by law or otherwise) to retain your account information or any other information associated with it and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain period of time, in which case we are only be able to comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>

<p>We may share your User Data with our third-party partners.</p>
<p>In some situations, transferees to whom we disclose your Information may be located overseas. Further, we may have servers located overseas. The jurisdictions in which these people and/or servers are likely to be located include the United States, Japan, and China. There may not be in place data protection laws which are substantially similar to, or serve the same purposes as the applicable data privacy laws in Hong Kong. This means your personal information may not be protected to the same or similar level in Hong Kong.</p>
<p><em>De-identifying your Information </em></p>
<p>We may de-identify your Information (so that you are not identified) and provide that Information to our business partners and/or affiliated entities. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our business partners and/or affiliated entities (or allow them to collect that Information from you), who may use such Information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Products and Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience.</p>
<p>However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a business partner and/affiliated entities (or allow them to collect such information) in a manner that would personally identify you. For example, we use Google Analytics to grow our business, to improve or develop our services, to monitor and analyse use of our Products and Services, for our technical administration, to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our Products and Services, and to verify that users have the authorisation needed for us to process their requests.

<p><strong>Accessing and modifying your Information</strong></p>
<p>If any Information you provided to us has changed, you should inform us. You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the Information you submit to us, such as your contact information.&nbsp; You may be able to access most of your Information via the Products and Services, for example, the Information you provided during the account registration process (i.e. your name, email address, password, etc.) can be accessed by logging into your account and navigating to account settings. Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you have provided to us:</p>
<ul>
<li>your nickname;</li>
<li>avatar photo;</li>
<li>phone number;</li>
<li>email address; and</li>
<li>digital wallet information</li>
</ul>
<p>You may be able to add, update, or delete Information. However, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. This means your Information is not permanently removed from the system.</p>
<p>In any event, you may request deletion of your account by contacting us by email at contatct@cybermiles.io.</p>
<p>To protect the integrity and security of the Information we hold, we may ask that you follow a defined access procedure, which may include steps to verify your identity. In certain cases, we may charge you an administration fee for providing you with access to the Information you have asked for, but we will inform you of this before proceeding. There may be cases where we are unable to provide the information you request, such as where it would interfere with the privacy of others or result in a breach of confidentiality. In these cases, we will let you know why we cannot comply with your request.</p>
<p>Even if you do not request access to and/or correct your personal information held by us, if we are satisfied that, having regard to the reasons for which we hold your personal information, that personal information is inaccurate, incomplete, out-of-date, irrelevant or misleading, we may take reasonable steps to correct that information.</p>
