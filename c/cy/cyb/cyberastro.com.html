      <b>Registration Data</b><br><br>
      During membership registration, Cyber Astro collects personal information including your name, gender, and email address, your current hometown and birth data information including your time of birth. This information is used strictly to generate your personal horoscopes online. Your email address is used to identify your unique birth data record in the database, since an email address is always unique and has no duplicates. You do not have to provide any personal information to use Cyber Astro’s services. However, if you choose not to become a member of Club CyberAstro, we may not be able to provide you with some of the other services dependent upon the collection of such information, such as your personalized free predictions.<br><br>
      <b>Through Log Files</b><br><br>
      Our server and statistics server capture information to gather broad demographic information that is not personal. We track the IP address of visitors to the site to find out demographically which parts of the world our traffic comes from. We collect browser types used and access times to analyze trends, administer the site, track users movements within the site to find out what services are most appealing. All of this information is used for gathering broad demographic data to enhance the performance and services of the site.<br><br>
      <b>Through Order Forms</b><br><br>
      For our paid personalized services we gather basically the information needed for fulfillment of the service. This is held in strict confidence, as explained earlier. We guarantee complete confidentiality of our members’ identity, horoscope details and the prediction details. Cyber Astro, Inc. further guarantees that no direct or indirect use will be made by Cyber Astro about any aspect of life, as revealed in the horoscope of a member, except for the explicit purpose of communicating the horoscope charts and predictions back to the member.<br><br>
      For payment of the paid services, we use an independent secure server company, Internet Billing Company, based in Florida. Your credit card information, as well as your address for address verification is collected by this company on their website and Cyber Astro, Inc. has no access to this information.<br><br>
      <b>Other information that we may collect</b><br><br>
      Any other information we have may for you come from actual email or other contact you may have made with us in regard to specific services or products. As a general rule, these are not made part of your member profile, and are used only to address your specific need or concern that you may have communicated to us on. Although we give you the option to tell your friends about our site, we do not monitor or keep any record of friends you may contact. Information gathered on our “Affiliate with Us”, is used primarily for a Business-to-Business purpose and to encourage inquiries from other web sites that might be interested in obtaining our Astrology Content for their own site. Information from “Advertise with Us” similarly is used to generate interest in other sites or companies that may wish to purchase banner advertising on our site.<br><br>

      We use the personal information you supply us, including your membership registration data, to enable us to provide you with personalized free predictions. In addition, this information is used in a demographic manner to enhance Cyber Astro’s services, personalize your experience and provide you with special offers and services that we think you will find valuable.<br><br>
      Cyber Astro uses the information described above to do, among other things, the following:<br><br>
      <ul>
       <li>Personalize and enhance the site and services such as providing you with your personalized predictions.
       </li><li>Send occasional personalized information about Cyber Astro and its site features, unless you have opted out of receiving these types of communications.
       </li><li>Contact members’ occasionally for feedback regarding Cyber Astro and our services.
      </li></ul>
      We may also use demographic information we collect to develop summary reports for our own advertising strategy and for other advertisers. An example of a summary report might be "100,000 people clicked on this link and of those people, 35% were members and are above the age of 25." Since our membership is global, we may also track which countries our members live in and whether it might be feasible to offer services in their own language, and make other decisions to enhance your overall experience of the site.<br><br>

Cookies are only served by our server for the session and are not kept on your computer. Without cookies, we would not be able to deliver the personalized predictions to you. It also saves you from having to enter your birth details every time you want a free personalized prediction or “mantra”.<br><br>
      Cyber Astro does not require users to accept cookies in order to  enjoy the site. You can set your browser to reject cookies, however, we would not be able to offer you the personalized free predictions that are available on the site.<br><br>
