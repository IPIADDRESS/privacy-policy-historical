  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h2>Policy Statement</h2>
  <p>CyberGrants, LLC, (“CyberGrants,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is highly committed to protecting the privacy of your information. CyberGrants provides this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) in support of our commitment to safeguarding your personal information.  This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected when you use our products, software services, websites (“sites”), or applications, collectively referred to as “Services.”   These Services include: Grant Management Software, Employee Engagement Software, Apply OnLine, EasyMatch, and Consiva.  By using our Services, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>Authorized Users</h2>
  <p>CyberGrants’ clients with fully executed agreements may designate authorized users (“Authorized Users”) from their employees, contractors, and agents with the right to access our Services and use the Services paid for by the Client. You hereby represent to CyberGrants that you are an Authorized User, and at least eighteen (18) years old.</p>

  <h2>Consent</h2>
  <p>By using our services you consent to the collection and use of the information described here. If we decide to make changes to the Privacy Statement, we will post the changes on this site to inform you of any updates on what information we collect and how we use it. As may be required by applicable law, we may also seek your explicit consent to process certain data and information collected on this website.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We receive the following information from your employer or directly from you when you use our Services:</p>

  <h3>Personal Information</h3>
  <p>Personal Information means any information, or set of information, that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of CyberGrants to identify a natural person. Personal information does not include information regarding corporate entities or information that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public Personal Information. CyberGrants collects Personal Information when you register with or use our Services. For example, you may use our Services to communicate via internal messaging with other employees, contractors or agents of your employer, make a charitable donation, submit a request for a matching program, volunteer for a project that require submission of contact information, participate in a blog, or post content on our Services. Additionally, if you visit or register on a CyberGrants sponsored site through social media, we may also receive certain Personal Information from those social media sites, and/or post regarding your charitable activity.  Personal information that CyberGrants may collect when you register with or use our services include:  name, mailing address information for home and/or business, mail code, business title, department, employee type or status, hire date, employee ID, and manager/hierarchy information.</p>
  <p>We may also collect information regarding your current location automatically (e.g., by IP address), or directly from you (e.g., zip code). In order to provide certain services while you are visiting our sites from a mobile device, we may automatically collect geolocation information from your mobile device, wireless carrier, or third party providers. Your mobile device permits you to turn off the location services. Please be sure to manage your mobile device and privacy preferences for the use of our Services.</p>
  <p>CyberGrants adheres to the following guidelines to protect your right to privacy:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>We only use your personal information to help us manage your account, to improve our services to you, to provide you with products you have requested, and to inform you about additional products or services that may be of interest to you.</li>
    <li>We only use your information for customer contact, account maintenance, billing, and to inform you of new features, improvements and any other customer-affecting reason.</li>
    <li>CyberGrants never sells your personal information to anyone or any organization.</li>
    <li>Our websites collect limited technical information about your computer. Such information includes your TCP/IP address, your browser type and your domain. The information we collect is used only by our support staff to assist us in monitoring system performance and up-time.</li>
    <li>Your membership is protected via SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). This measure of protection is used by many electronic commerce sites and on-line banks to protect personal and financial information. SSL assures that your data, including personal information entered by an individual or transmitted to CyberGrants by a client, is protected using the highest level of data encryption available. Personal information is never stored on CyberGrants laptops or other portable devices.</li>
    <li>Licensed users access CyberGrants by inputting a username and personal password. These are unique in our database; your password should never be shared with anyone.</li>
    <li>Circumstances may arise where CyberGrants decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize our company. Such a transaction may involve, in accordance with applicable law, the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is CyberGrants' practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these instances.</li>
    <li>We may collect and possibly share personal data and any other additional information available to us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of CyberGrants' terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
    <li>CyberGrants will not retain your personal data longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws, regulations, or client specific data retention policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Non-Personal Information</h3>
  <p>We may collect your TCP/ IP address, Internet Provider, browser type, and language, referring and exit pages, URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, sections of the sites visited, number of links you click while on the sites, search terms, operating systems, website traffic, keywords, and other related statics.</p>

  <h3>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3>
  <p>When you visit our sites, cookies or other tracking technologies may be placed on your computers or mobile devices. A cookie is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores Non-Personal Information about your account, preferences and use of our sites and Services. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return to our sites and track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. They also help us to detect certain kinds of fraud. We use cookies to store preferences, record session information, record user-specific information on what pages are accessed or visited, alert you to new areas of our sites, or customize web page content.</p>

  <h3>Data Retention</h3>
  <p>CyberGrants will not retain your personal data longer than is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws, regulations, or client specific retention policies.</p>
  <p>"Session" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as managing page views and your shopping cart. Typically, your browser will erase session cookies once you exit the browser. "Persistent" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computer or mobile device after you exit the browser. Persistent cookies allow us to retrieve certain information that you have previously provided to us (e.g., your user ID if you asked for it to be remembered). Our sites may use both session and persistent cookies.</p>
  <p>Our sites may also use "tracer tags," which are tiny graphic images placed on our site pages or in our e-mails that allow us to determine whether you have performed certain actions. When you access these pages or open e-mail messages, the tags generate a notice of that action to us or our Providers. These tools allow us to measure responsiveness to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions. Our use of cookies for tracer tags is restricted to session cookies, therefore does not leave artifacts on user workstations. In addition, CyberGrants only tracks a user's session ID and does not track Personally Identifiable (PI) data.</p>
  <p>You may manage, block or delete cookies and other tracking technologies by adjusting your browser's security and privacy settings but, if you do so, you may not be able to use particular features of our sites or Services.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We may use your Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you or your employer provides Personal Information for a certain reason, we may use such Personal Information in connection with the reason it was provided. For instance, we may use Personal Information to provide the Services; administer, improve and provide access to our sites and Services; respond to inquiries; upload User Content that may include Personal Information; or to communicate with you regarding our products and services or other information which may be of interest to you.  You can opt-out of receiving such communications from us at any time. Simply follow the "Opt-Out" instructions in our emails or send an opt-out request to us at the address under "Contact Us."</p>

  <ul>
