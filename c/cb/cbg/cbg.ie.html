        <h1>Car Buyers Guide Privacy Notice</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Last updated April 1st 2008</strong></p>
        <p>
            The fee for our online service is €2.50 each week. As our customer this entitles
            you to use our services on the web site www.cbg.ie. From time to time we provide
            this service free of charge. To avail of our services you must also register your
            personal information with us. Car Buyers Guide knows that you care how information
            about you is used and shared and we appreciate your trust in us to do that carefully
            and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. <strong>&gt;By using Car Buyers
                Guide web site, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this
                Privacy Notice.</strong></p>
        <p>
            <strong>Controllers of Personal Information</strong></p>
        <p>
            Any personal information provided or to be gathered by Car Buyers Guide is controlled
            primarily by Car Buyers Guide of Penthouse Floor, Arena House, Arena Raod, Sandyford
            Industrial Estate, Dublin 18.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Car Buyers Guide adheres to the European Directive on data protection.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Collection and Use of Personal Information About Customers</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve
            your experience at Car Buyers Guide. We use the information to deliver services
            and products, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products, services
            and promotional offers, update our records and generally maintain your accounts
            with us, display content such as my basket and customer reviews and recommend vehicles
            and services that might be of interest to you. We also use this information to improve
            our site, subscription options and platform, prevent or detect fraud or abuses of
            our website and enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other
            functions on our behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Here are the types of information we gather.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information you give us: we receive and store any information you enter on our website
                or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information but
                then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. </li>
            <li>Automatic information: we receive and store certain types of information whenever
                you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies" and we obtain
                certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Car Buyers Guide. A
                number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously.
                Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at Car
                Buyers Guide if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools
                exist. </li>
            <li>E-mail communications: to help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often
                receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Car Buyers Guide if your computer
                supports such capabilities. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from
                us, please send a blank email to remove@cbg.ie. </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>What About Cookies?</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive
                through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to
                provide features such as search within 5 miles of your home, personalized greetings
                and storage of items in your "Your Basket" between visits. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Does Car Buyers Guide Share the Information It Receives?</strong></p>
        <p>
            Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are
            not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only
            as described below:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Agents:</strong> we employ other companies and individuals to perform functions
                on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering magazine packages,
                sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists,
                analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments
                and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed
                to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they
                must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and
                as permitted by the Data Protection Act. </li>
            <li><strong>Promotional offers:</strong> sometimes we send offers to selected groups
                of Car Buyers Guide customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we
                do not give them your name or address. If you do not want to receive such offers,
                please send a blank email to remove@cbg.ie </li>
            <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In the unlikely event that Car Buyers Guide
                or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course
                be one of the transferred assets. </li>
            <li><strong>Protection of Car Buyers Guide and others:</strong> we release account and
                other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with
                law, to enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements or to protect
                the rights, property or safety of Car Buyers Guide, our users or others. This includes
                exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection
                and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting,
                sharing or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers
                for commercial purposes in a way that is contrary to the commitments made in this
                Privacy Notice. </li>
            <li><strong>With your consent:</strong> other than as set out above, you will receive
                notice when information about you might go to third parties and you will have an
                opportunity to choose not to share the information unless you expressly requested
                information e.g. to order a brochure on a car from a distributor. </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>What Choices Do I Have?</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though
                it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such Car Buyers Guide
                features.</li>
            <li>You can add or update certain information on the registration page. When you update
                information, we usually keep a copy of the previous version for our records. </li>
            <li>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please send a blank
                email to remove@cbg.ie. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Conditions of Use, Notices and Revisions</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This notice is governed by the laws of Ireland. If you have any concern about privacy
            at Car Buyers Guide, please send a thorough description to info@cbg.ie and we will
            try to resolve it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our business changes constantly and our Privacy Notice will change also. We may
            e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed
            us not to, but you should check our website frequently to see recent changes. Unless
            stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we
            have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however,
            and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective
            of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Information You Give Us</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            You provide most of such information when you search, buy, post, participate in
            a contest or questionnaire or communicate with customer services. For example, you
            provide information when you search for a product, place an order through Car Buyers
            Guide or one of our third-party partners, communicate with us by phone, e-mail or
            otherwise, complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form, employ other personal
            notification services such as Car Buyers Guide Vehicle Alerts. As a result of those
            actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address and phone
            number, your credit card information, details of people to whom purchases should
            be shipped (including address and phone number) etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Automatic Information</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol
            (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, login, e-mail address,
            password, computer and connection information such as browser type and version,
            your operating system and platform, purchase history, which we sometimes aggregate
            with similar information from other customers to create features the full Uniform
            Resource Locators (URL), through and from our website (including date and time),
            cookie number and products/vehicles/editorial you viewed or searched for.
