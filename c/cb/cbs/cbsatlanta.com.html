        <br>
        Since 1902, Meredith Corporation has focused on providing our customers with products and
        services that distinguish themselves on the basis of quality, customer service and value.
        Our Online Privacy Policies are designed to help us serve our customers while meeting
        their privacy expectations.<br>
        <br>
        We are a member of the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) and Magazine Publishers of
        America (MPA) and support self-regulation by these industry associations. We believe this
        is the best way to maintain good customer service while addressing the privacy concerns of
        our customers. Also, we actively participate in the DMA Privacy Committee, the DMA Ethics
        Operating Committee, and the MPA New Media Committee. <br>
        <br>
        Additionally, we fully support and use the DMA Mail and Telephone Preference Services
        through which individuals may restrict the release of their names for marketing purposes.<p>When
        you register with our sites, enter contests or purchase items online, you may request that
        we remove your name from our marketing lists by sending an email message indicating your
        wish to restrict offers made to you.<br>
        <br>
        Our Web sites automatically recognize some information about our visitors, including the
        company that provides their internet service. Our sites do not automatically recognize the
        name, address, e-mail address or similar information specific to an<br>
        individual. Such identifying information is recorded only if you supply it to us via an
        e-mail, bulletin board message, or online form. Our "cookie" technology allows
        us to record how many times you visit our site and it helps us manage content. This<br>
        information allows us to better serve visitors to the site and is not rented or sold to
        any other company. <br>
        <br>
        If you send a comment or request information from us via email, you will receive future
        communication from us through email.<br>
        <br>
        If you contact us to order product, comment or request information and provide us with
        your postal mailing address, youâ€™ll be added to our database to receive future
        mailings.<br>
        <br>
        Meredith occasionally makes the lists of postal addresses volunteered on its Web site
        available to other carefully screened associations or companies whose products or services
        we think you may find of interest. We pre-screen all use of our information for our
        customers.<br>
        <br>
        If you do not wish to receive such mailings, simply contact us via <a href="mailto:mercirc@mdp.com">email</a>. If you prefer to send your request via regular
        mail and you receive Meredith magazines, simply copy your mailing label address exactly
        (or clip it out) and send your request to our<br>
        Circulation Department at 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, IA 50309-3023. <br>
