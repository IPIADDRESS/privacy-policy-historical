					  </p><p><span class="style2">The following are the types of information we may collect:</span>                      
					  </p><blockquote>
					    <p><span class="style2"><strong>a. Web Site Usage Information &amp; Device Identifiers</strong><br>
				        We may receive and store certain types of web site usage information whenever you visit or interact with the Web Sites. For example, we may collect the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view, other similar information and your IP address.  We also may collect your IP address or some other unique identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable (collectively referred to herein as a "Device Identifier"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, your cell phone, or other device used to access the Internet, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. We may associate your Device Identifier with the personal information you provide. When analyzed, web site usage information helps us determine how visitors arrive at the Web Sites, what type of content is most popular, and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising.</span>                      
				        </p>
					    <p><span class="style2"><strong>b. Information You Provide Us</strong><br>
				        We may ask you to provide us with two types of information: (1) personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, e-mail address, cell phone number, telephone number, and physical address; and (2) demographic information, such as gender, zip code, or similar information. We may collect this information at various places and forms on the Web Sites, including registration forms for newsletters and other communications (e.g., whether by e-mail, mobile device, etc.), when you communicate or otherwise interact with us, when you submit information to us (whether or not the information is intended to be posted on the Web Sites), contests or sweepstakes, surveys or voting or when you purchase a product or service through the Web Sites. You may also be asked to choose a user name and password in order to identify yourself during future visits to the Web Sites. Do not use your real name or the name of any other actual person as your user name. Providing us with information about yourself is your choice, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Web Sites' features.</span>                      
				        </p>
					    <p><span class="style2">For your convenience, if you register with one of our Web Sites through which you create a user name and password, that user name and password may work on the other Web Sites where user names and passwords are utilized. The personal information you provide and any additional information we collect about you may be used by us and across all of the Web Sites.</span>                      
				        </p>
					    <p><span class="style2"><strong>c. Information from Other Sources</strong><br>
				        We may receive information about you from other sources; for example, we may obtain geographic or demographic information, or information regarding your possible interests, from third parties, or we may receive information from a marketing partner in connection with a co-branded web site or promotion. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Web Sites. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personal information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed by us at the time you provide your personal information.
					      </span>                      
				        </p>
					    <p><span class="style2"><strong>d. E-mail Communications</strong><br>
				        When you open e-mails from the Web Sites, we may receive a confirmation noting you opened the e-mail, if your computer supports such capabilities. We also may keep track of which e-mails we or our partners send you. Additionally, we keep a record of what types of emails you have opted to and not to receive.</span>                      
				        </p>
					    <p><span class="style2"><strong>e. Send To a Friend</strong><br>
				        If you send a friend a communication from the Web Sites, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, etc.) is used on a one-time basis to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose, unless we obtain additional consent.</span>

					  </p><blockquote>
					    <p><span class="style2"><strong>a. Cookies</strong><br>
				        </span><span class="style2">The Web Sites use standard technology called "cookies," which are small data files that are transferred to your computer (or other Internet accessing device) when you visit the Web Sites and allow your browser to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your web browser to the Web Sites whenever you visit the Web Sites, and may make navigating and using the Web Sites easier for you.

					    <p><span class="style2"> <strong>b. Web Beacons</strong><br>
				        The Web Sites and any communications sent by the Web Sites may contain electronic images (generally, single-pixel ".gif" images) called "web beacons."

					  <p><span class="style6">3.  HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</span>                      
					  </p><p><span class="style2">The information you provide to us may be used to:</span>

					  </p><p><span class="style2">The Web Sites may use third party network advertisers to serve advertisements on the Web Sites and may use a traffic measurement service to analyze traffic on the Web Sites. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the Web Sites and other web sites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Although advertisers and other companies do not have access to cookies set by the Web Sites, the Web Sites' third party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser. These third party cookies are set to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements are to you. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies and web beacons are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. While we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the Web Sites, you may wish to visit <a href="Effective Date: October 16, 2009">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>, which provides information regarding the "opt-out" procedures of certain third party ad servers we may use</span>                      
					  </p><p><span class="style6">5.  WITH WHOM INFORMATION MAY BE SHARE</span>                      
					  </p><p><span class="style2"> Except as otherwise disclosed at the time you provide your information, the following outlines the ways in which your information may be shared with others:</span>                      
					  </p><blockquote>
					    <p><span class="style2"><strong>a. Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf</strong><br>
				        We employ third parties to perform functions on our behalf; examples include hosting or operating Web Sites, fulfilling orders for products and services purchased through the Web Sites, sending e-mail and/or other communications, providing wireless services, removing repetitive information from customer lists, data analysis, marketing assistance, credit card payment processing and customer service. These third parties may have access to your personal information for the purpose of performing such functions on the Web Sites' behalf.</span></p>
					    <p><span class="style2"><strong>b. Non-Personal Information</strong><br>
				        We may share non-personal information, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic information, and web site usage information with third parties.</span>
				        </p>
					    <p><span class="style2">c. When You Agree to Receive Information/Offers From Third Parties
					      You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from third party(s). If you do not agree to have your personal information shared, your personal information will not be shared with such third party(s) for direct marketing purposes. If you do agree to have your personal information shared, your personal information will be disclosed to such third party(s) and all information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of such third party(s). We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third party(s) and, therefore, you should review the privacy policies and practices of such third party(s) prior to agreeing to receive such information from third party(s). If you later decide that you no longer want to receive communication from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.</span>                      
				        </p>
					    <p><span class="style2"><strong>d. Products &amp; Services Offered in Partnership with Third-Party(s)</strong><br>
				        Certain Web Sites are provided to you in partnership with third party(s) ("Co-Branded Sites") and may require you to disclose personal information in order to register for and access products and/or services. Such Co-Branded Sites will identify the third party partner(s). If you elect to register for such products and/or services at Co-Branded Sites you may be providing your information to both Company and the third party partner(s) and your information may be subject to a separate privacy policy available at the point of registration. Further, if you sign-in to a Co-Branded Web Site with a user name and password obtained at one of our Web Sites, you are automatically registering with the Co-Branded Site and your personal information may be disclosed to the identified third party partner(s) for that Co-Branded Site and will be subject to the posted privacy policy(ies).</span></p>
					    <p><span class="style2"><strong>e. Sweepstakes, Contests &amp; Promotions</strong><br>
				        We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions through the Web Sites that may require registration. If you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, your personal information may be disclosed to third parties in connection with the administration of such promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law, such as on a winners list. Also, by entering a promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the promotion and disclosing some of your personally identifiable information in publicizing you as the winner of the promotion. Where a third-party advertiser or sponsor is involved in a promotion, they also may have access to your personally identifiable information and their use thereof may be governed by their privacy policies which we do not control. We urge you to review the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the promotion before participating.</span>                      
				        </p>
					    <p><span class="style2"><strong>f. Business Transfers</strong><br>
				        Company shares the information collected through the Web Sites with and among the Web Sites, and may share the information with its parent, subsidiaries and affiliates. Company or any of it assets, including the Web Sites, may be sold, or other transactions may occur in which your personal information is one of the key business assets for the transaction. In such a case, your personal information may be one of the business assets we transfer. Hence, Company reserves the right to disclose and transfer user information, including personal information, in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our assets, or other corporate change.
					      </span></p>
					    <p><span class="style2"><strong>g. Legal Protections &amp; Law Enforcement</strong><br>
				        We may disclose information about our users, including your personal information, in the event we are required to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process or other valid law enforcement measures; to comply with a legal obligation; at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing the Web Sites and applicable laws; or to protect the legal rights, interests, or safety of the Web Sites, our users or others. We may also use Device Identifiers to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, internet service providers or law enforcement agencies in our discretion. Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.
