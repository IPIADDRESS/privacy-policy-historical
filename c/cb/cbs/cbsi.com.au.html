      <p><strong>Web Beacons and Other Technologies</strong></p>
<p>We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and similar technologies, to track your use of the CBS Interactive Web Sites. Web beacons (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a way for us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed.</p>
      <p>We use web beacons to improve your experience on our CBS Interactive Web Sites, including to provide you with content customized to your interests and to understand whether users read email messages and click on links contained within those messages so that we can deliver relevant content and offers. Our web beacons may collect some contact information (for example, the email address associated with an email message that contains a web beacon).</p>
      <p>CBS Interactive Web Sites also may include third-party web beacons. These web beacons allow third party service providers to collect certain information such as your IP address, your browser type, and the web page that you visited before arriving at our CBS Interactive Web Sites. These service providers process the information they collect for purposes of auditing, research, and reporting information about the CBS Interactive Web Sites and advertisements viewed on the CBS Interactive Web Sites.</p>
      <p>Third parties that use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to help us with traffic measurement, research and analytics include Omniture, Comscore, Nielsen, Data Warehouse (the internal US System), Revenue Science, Boomerang, Google analytics, Doubleclick, and MediaMind.

      <p><strong>Mobile Devices</strong></p>
      <p>Certain mobile devices contain unique identifiers that can be used, for example, to identify the physical location of such devices. Mobile devices also typically transmit caller ID data when used to transmit a telephone call or text message. CBS Interactive Web Sites may collect, use, transmit, process and maintain unique identifiers, caller ID data, location-based data, and similar information when you rely on mobile devices, including to provide the services you request, tell you about offers we think you will value, and improve your experience on CBS Interactive Web Sites. CBS Interactive Web Sites also may require collection of your mobile phone number in order for you to participate in certain services or features and that number may be associated with such information.</p>
      <p><strong>Your Choices with respect to Cookies and Web Beacons</strong></p>
      <p>You have the choice to set your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, notify you when a cookie is set, and to delete your cookies periodically. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.</p>
      <p>Web beacons are generally used in conjunction with cookies, so if your browser is set to reject cookies, or if cookies are deleted, web beacons will be unable to track your activity as you navigate between web sites.</p>
      <p>It is up to you whether to allow us or third parties to send you cookies, but if you block cookies, you may not be able to view or access some or all of a CBS Interactive Web Site.

	<h2>CBS Interactive Online Advertising</h2>
        <p>In order to customize your experience on the CBS Interactive Web Sites, we may use <a href="http://cbsiprivacy.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1267" target="_blank">cookies, web beacons, and other technologies</a> to collect information about the content and advertisements you view on our CBS Interactive Web Sites and the web sites of our business partners. Based on this information, and other information we may collect about you as described in the "Information Collected" section of our Privacy Policy, we try to assign you to one or more categories of interests and show content and advertising that relevant to the categories of interests to which we have assigned you. For example, if you access an article about computers on ZDNet.com.au, we may show you a computer-related advertisement on CNET.com.au based on your apparent interests.</p>

        <p>We also may receive information from third parties about you and your activities on other sites for the purpose of serving relevant advertisements to you on CBS Interactive Web Sites. For example, if you access an article on a third-party site about computers, we may use that information to serve you with a computer-related advertisement on a CBS Interactive Web Site. This CBS Interactive privacy policy does not cover the practices of third parties, including those that may disclose information to CBS Interactive.</p>
<p>Please note that we may share information about our users with advertisers so that they can measure the effectiveness of advertisements viewed on the CBS Interactive Web Sites. For example, we may tell advertisers the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement. Except in the circumstances described in the "sharing" section of our Privacy Policy, such as with your consent, this information will be anonymized or aggregated.</p>
        <p>These online advertising efforts across CBS Interactive Web Sites do not result in you seeing more advertisements, just more relevant advertising, and they allow us to provide you with free content and services on our Web Sites. We hope you value our efforts to show you content and advertising that more closely reflects your interests.</p>
        <h2>Third-Party Online Advertising</h2>
        <p>Some of the advertisements you see on CBS Interactive Web Sites are delivered by third parties who also collect information through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies about your online activities, either on our CBS Interactive Web Sites or across the Internet, in an effort to understand your interests and deliver you advertisements that are tailored to your interests. These third parties include advertisers, advertising agencies, and ad networks that may collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements.</p>
        <p>In addition, CBS Interactive works with third parties to help us track the ads that are delivered to you, in particular to control the number of times you receive the same ad, and to analyze the effectiveness of advertising on the CBS Interactive Web Sites.</p>
        <p>Please note that CBS Interactive does not have access to the information these third parties may collect about your interests to deliver relevant advertising to you, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by the CBS Interactive Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>Third parties that currently serve, track and/or analyze ads on our Web Sites, and thereby may collect information about your online activities on such Web Sites, include, but are not limited to, <a href="http://www.atlassolutions.com/" target="_blank">Atlas</a>, <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/" target="_blank">DoubleClick</a>, <a href="http://www.eyewonder.com/" target="_blank">EyeWonder</a>, <a href="http://www.mediamind.com/" target="_blank">Mediamind</a>, <a href="http://www.audiencescience.com/uk/privacy" target="_blank">Audience Science</a> and <a href="http://www.pointroll.com/" target="_blank">Pointroll</a>.

        <h2>Children's Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections when children visit the sites on which this Children's Privacy Policy is posted. The following guidelines supplement our <a href="http://cbsiprivacy.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1268" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> and follow the rules set by the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and other applicable laws. "Child" means an individual under 13 years of age or an individual under 18 where the collection, use or disclosure of personal information about such an individual is restricted by applicable law. When we use the term "parent" below, we mean to include legal guardians.</p>
        <p>CBS Interactive acknowledges that the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) does not stipulate an age when a child or young person can make decisions about their own personal information. Accordingly, CBS Interactive provides the following guidance to children, young people, parents and guardians in relation to persons under the age of 18.</p>
        <p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
        <p>Children can enjoy content and features on CBS Interactive Web Sites without directly providing contact information. However, children who wish to participate in sweepstakes, contests, and certain other special activities may need to provide information such as first name, user name, password, email address, date of birth, city and state of residence, and gender.</p>
        <p>In the course of participating in interactive features such as chat rooms and message boards, a child may provide us with additional information about himself or herself, such as the contents of his or her postings. Some information, including information collected through <a href="http://cbsiprivacy.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1267" target="_blank">cookies, web beacons, and other technologies</a>, may be collected automatically. For more information, see the "<a href="http://cbsiprivacy.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1268#Full02Auto" target="_blank">Information we collect automatically</a>" section of our Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>If we knowingly collect, use, or disclose contact information collected from a child CBS Interactive may provide notice and obtain parental consent in accordance with applicable law.</p>
        <p>We do not condition a child's participation in an online activity on the child's providing more contact information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.</p>
        <p><strong>Use of Information</strong></p>
        <p>We use the information we collect consistent with the services requested by the child. For example, we may use information provided by the child to:</p>
        <ul>
              <li>Send a newsletter, electronic card, and other communication requested by the child;</li>
              <li>Enable a child's participation in certain interactive features such as games, contests, message boards, chat rooms, song requests, and online scrolling tickers; and</li>
              <li>Respond to correspondence sent by the child.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, we may use a parent's contact information to communicate with the parent regarding the child's activities on CBS Interactive Web Sites. For example, if a child wins a sweepstakes or contest, we may use the parent's contact information to conduct prize fulfillment.</p>
        <p><strong>Disclosure of Information</strong></p>
        <p>Information collected from children will be disclosed in the same ways described in the "<a href="http://cbsiprivacy.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1268#Full04Disclosure" target="_blank">Disclosure of Information</a>" section of our general Privacy Policy. Third parties who receive contact information collected by CBS Interactive have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of that information. Parents have the option not to consent to the disclosure of their child's contact information to third parties. Parents may consent to CBS Interactive's collection and use of their child's contact information while refusing to permit the disclosure of that information to third parties.</p>
        <p><strong>Parents' Choices and Access to Children's Information</strong></p>
        <p>Parents may review the contact information we have collected from their child, refuse to permit us to collect further contact information from their child, and request that any contact information we have collected be deleted from our records. Parents may also correct factual inaccuracies.</p>
        <p>To review, update, or delete your child's contact information, please <a href="http://cbsiprivacy.custhelp.com/app/ask/" target="_blank">contact us</a>. You may also send your request to the postal address listed below. To protect your child's safety, we ask for proof of your identification. We may deny access if we believe there is a question about your identity.</p>
        <p>Certain information cannot be deleted because of other legal obligations.</p>
        <p><strong>Changes to the Children's Privacy Policy</strong></p>
        <p>We may amend our Children's Privacy Policy at any time. We will provide parents with notice of any material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and share children's contact information. Please note that, at all times, parents should update their contact information to provide us with current email addresses. We will apply material changes in our Children's Privacy Policy only in conformance with applicable law.</p>
        <p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p>
