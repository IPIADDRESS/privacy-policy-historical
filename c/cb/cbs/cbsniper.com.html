Because we   want to build users' trust and confidence in our     privacy practices,   we want to disclose them to you.<br>

              <strong>Changes in this Privacy Statement </strong><br>
          If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post     those changes   to this privacy statement, the home page, and other     places we deem   appropriate so that you are aware of what information     we collect, how we   use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we     disclose it. <br>
          We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at     any time, so   please review it frequently.&nbsp; If we make material     changes to this   policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means     of a notice on   our home page.</p>

            By registering to our newsletter, you are agreeing to     receive our   newsletters on a daily basis. <strong>surplusprovide.com </strong> has   the right to change frequency of delivery of its newsletters     without   notice. </p>
          <p align="justify" class="style88"><strong>Collection and Use   of     information </strong><br>
            We respect your right to privacy. <strong>surplusprovide.com </strong> received your information from your submission to us or through one of       our affiliates.<strong> surplusprovide.com </strong> is the owner   of   the   information that you provided in any registration process.   Your   email   address and any other identifying information that you   give us   will not   be revealed to any third party, including any of   the direct   marketers   who may use us to pass offers to you. </p>
          <p align="justify" class="style88">We use the information that   you     provided primarily to send you our newsletters. Moreover, the       information subscribers give us is sometimes used to send prizes, verify       legal age, and to send third-party mailings based on the interests     that   each individual subscriber has opted-in for. We may also   collect   and   report to third parties (EWh as affiliates, content and   service     providers, and advertisers) aggregated information from our   web site.     For example, we may aggregate and report to third parties   that X people     purchased a particular product during a month, or   that Y% of visitors   to   this web site are between the ages 25-34. </p>
          <p align="justify" class="style88">From time to time, we may   provide you     the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our   site.&nbsp;     If you participate, we will request certain personally   identifiable     information from you. Participation in these surveys or   contests is     completely voluntary and you, therefore, have a choice   whether or not     to disclose this information.&nbsp; The requested information   typically     includes contact information (EWh as name and shipping   address),   and   demographic information (EWh as zip code). </p>
          <p align="justify" class="style88">As is true of most web   sites, we also     gather certain information automatically and store it in   log files.&nbsp;     This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses,   browser     type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages,     operating   system, date/time stamp, and click stream data.&nbsp;We use this       information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze       trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the       site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a       whole.&nbsp;We do link this automatically-collected data to personally       identifiable information like IP addresses and email addresses.   However,     this is solely for internal uses and used to verify   appropriate     registration methods. </p>
