 <br> This website ("Site," "us," or "we") is the official website for CBS RADIO Inc. ("CBS RADIO") and is owned and operated by CBS RADIO ("Owner and Operator"). CBS RADIO is the parent company of numerous radio stations located across the country ("CBS RADIO Stations"). This is a business-oriented website targeted primarily to CBS RADIO's valued business partners and advertisers, promotional partners and sponsors (collectively known as "Advertisers"). However, the Career Page is open to all visitors to the Site who are interested in employment opportunities with CBS RADIO or CBS RADIO Stations. The Career Page is powered by Monster.com and the collection of resumes or biographical information is operated and managed by Monster.com. Please see Monster.com's <a href="http://about.monster.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>. <br>

 <br> This Privacy Policy only applies to the privacy policies and business practices of CBS RADIO regarding this Site. It does not cover any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") collected directly by CBS RADIO Stations, Advertisers, corporate affiliates, or any other company, unless specifically stated. <strong>If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the Site's or CBS RADIO activities and features that require you to provide your Personal Information. (The type of Personal Information collected is listed below.)</strong><br>     <br>

 <br> Your privacy is very important to us. Because we gather certain types of Personal Information from users of this Site, we feel you should know how we collect, use, disclose, manage, and store the Personal Information that you may voluntarily provide us and the Personal Information that is collected passively through the use of cookies or image tags. This Privacy Policy is a part of the Site's <a href="info/terms_of_use.php">Terms of Use Agreement.</a> Both the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement are binding on all users. We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting without advance notice to you. Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting. Notice of material changes to either document will be posted on the Site's homepage. However, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement often for updates. <br><br>
     <a name="privacy_rights"></a><strong><u>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</u></strong> <br><br>
 Residents of the State of California, under a new provision of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an Opt-out or Opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as Advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. <br>

 <br> This Site qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you with details on how you may Opt-out to the use of your Personal Information by specific third parties, including Advertisers for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information during the preceding year for marketing purposes. Significantly, this Site in its current format was not launched until September, 2005. <br><br>

 If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). You may contact us in two ways. Send an email to <a href="mailto:privacyadministrator@cbsradio.com">privacyadministrator@cbsradio.com</a> Alternatively, you may contact: <br><br><br>
