                    Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. 
                    We use this data to tailor your experience at cbseguess.com, 
                    showing content that we think you might be interested in, 
                    and displaying the content according to your preferences. 
                    We do this in two ways. First, we analyze member’s information 
                    in aggregate - that is, we collect information about thousands 
                    of site visits and analyze it as a whole. This kind of study 
                    involves looking for trends among many visitors to cbseguess.com, 
                    rather than analyzing information about any individual member. 
                    Examples include researching which parts of the site are accessed 
                    most frequently, or determining which products are most attractive 
                    to our users. Second, we may use information gathered during 
                    your visit to help customize our communications with you. 
                    <br>
                    cbseguess.com may periodically conduct individual voluntary 
                    member surveys. We encourage our members to participate in 
                    these surveys because they provide us with important information 
                    that helps us to improve the types of services we offer, and 
                    how we provide them to you. The responses we collect in online 
                    surveys are anonymous. In the end, we hope to tailor our communications 
                    with you to fit your needs - so that you receive more of what 
                    you want from us and less of what you don't want.<br>

                    This site contains links to other websites. Please be aware 
                    that cbseguess.com is not responsible for the privacy practices 
                    of other Web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when 
                    they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of 
                    each and every web site that collects personally identifiable

                    <strong> 3. Information on Use of Cookies </strong><br>
                    <br>
                    A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive 
                    containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is 
                    in no way linked to any personally identifiable information 
                    while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the 
                    cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie 
                    on cbseguess.com site, the user would not have to log in a 
                    password more than once, thereby saving time while on our 
                    site. If a user rejects a cookie, they may still use our site. 
                    The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited 
                    in some areas on our site. We occasionally use cookies to 
                    anonymously track and target the interests of our users to 
                    enhance the experience on our site or for advertising tracking 
                    purposes. In addition, cookies may be used on our site to 
                    allow enhanced capabilities such as chat. We do not and will 
                    not use cookies to collect private information from any user!
