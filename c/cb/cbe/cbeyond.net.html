<p class="hdr">Cbeyond Communications Online Privacy Statement</p>
<p>At Cbeyond Communications we are committed to honoring the privacy of our on-line customers and visitors to our Web sites. We recognize the importance to you, our Web site customer or visitor, of maintaining an appropriate level of privacy and security for the personal information we collect from you over the Internet. The following discloses our Web site information gathering and use practices and is limited to the protection and use of personal information collected by us on and through this Web site. Your access to and use of our site are subject to this policy and any other terms of use or policies posted by us.  We may from time to time change this privacy policy with or without notice, so please check it regularly for any changes or updates.  Please note that this privacy statement applies only to this site and not to the web sites of our advertisers or of other companies or organizations to which we link. All references to "Cbeyond Communications" throughout this policy statement include, unless otherwise stated, all Cbeyond Communications affiliate companies, successors and assigns.</p>

<p><b>What Kinds of Information Does Cbeyond Communications Collect and Use?</b></p>

<p>The only personally identifiable information we collect about visitors to our Web site is provided voluntarily. "Personally identifiable information" is information that tells us specifically who you are, like your name, street address, email address, billing address, social security number, credit card number, other service account information, and certain other financial information.  In general, you can visit our Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. However, if you are using our online services that include some portions of our Web site, such as Cbeyond Online, such services may be accessible only to users who have registered with us (and who may be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information as part of the registration or login process). In addition, our Web servers may use "cookies" (described below) to collect information about visitors such as your domain name, host from which you access the Internet, the IP address of your computer, and your browser software and operating system.  This information may be aggregated to measure such things as the number of visits, average time spent on the site, number of pages viewed, and methods by which our site was found. Cbeyond Communications uses such information to evaluate the use of our site and to continuously improve the content and services being provided.</p>

<p>At times we may ask you for contact information or conduct on-line surveys in order to better understand your needs so that we can provide you with a customized experience. If we wish to use this information other than as set forth in this statement, we will let you know at the time of collection. We will take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard this information from unauthorized access.</p>

<p>When you use our online services by accessing your account information, ordering a service or making a payment on-line, requesting a product or service information, or sending us e-mail, we will ask you to provide  personally identifiable information to us. When you supply information about yourself for  such specific purposes, we use the information for that purpose and to manage the internal operations and security of our Web site consistent with the terms of use and policies established from time to time governing this site. Such purpose may involve the disclosure of such information to unaffiliated companiesor vendors where necessary to and for the limited purpose of processing your request, processing a transaction authorized by you or providing you with products or services.  Furthermore, we may use, disclose or transfer certain personally identifiable information or other information about you (i) to provide you enhanced services; (ii) to market services among the categories of services you currently subscribe; (iii) to obtain a credit report; (iv) to protect the confidentiality or security of your records; (v) to law enforcement or other government officials if appropriate for your protection or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of possible unlawful activity; (vi) to our attorneys, accountants, and regulators; (vii) in connection with a sale or merger of Cbeyond Communications or (viii) for other legally permissible purposes.  We may also share aggregate anonymized data relating to the transactions on the site and use of our services for marketing, research and other purposes. </p> 

<p>We also want you to be aware that certain information related to telecommunications services provided to you by Cbeyond Communications, commonly referred to as "Customer Proprietary Network Information" or "CPNI," is subject to special Federal laws and regulations, with which we are fully committed to comply, both in the on-line environment and in all other respects. 
We believe it is also necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Cbeyond Communications' Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.</p>

<p><b>Who Has Access to This Information?</b></p>

<p>Except as set forth in this policy or unless we specifically disclose it to you at the time of collection or subsequently obtain your approval, we will not make any personally identifiable information that is gathered on our site available to unaffiliated organizations for commercial purposes unrelated to the business of Cbeyond Communications. </p>

<p>Certain federal, state and local laws or government regulations may require us to disclose  personally identifiable information about you. In these circumstances, we will use reasonable efforts to disclose only the information required by law, subpoena or court order to be disclosed.</p>

<p><b>Cookies</b></p>

<p>Our site may make use of cookies (or a similar technology) to better manage our sites and to assist us in providing you with tailored information and services.

<p>Cbeyond Communications' policy is not to read or disclose private e-mail communications that are transmitted using Cbeyond Communications services except to respond, if directed to us, or as required to operate the service, as set forth in the terms of use and policies established from time to time governing the service, or as otherwise required by law.</p>

<p><b>Security</b></p>

<p>Cbeyond Communications maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the confidentiality of personally identifiable information provided by you on and through our Web site. For example, unique passcodes or passwords are required to access a number of our Web site services. In addition to requiring the use of a unique passcode or password, all payments processed through our Web site require certain personally identifiable information provided by you to be sent in a "Secure Session" using Secure Socket Layer encryption technology. This technology encrypts - or scrambles - your financial or credit card account information to help prevent unauthorized parties from reading it. We regularly test and update our technology to help protect your personally identifiable information. However, such precautions do not guarantee that our Web site is invulnerable to all security breaches. Cbeyond Communications makes no warranty, guarantee, or representation that use of our Web site is protected from all viruses, security threats or other vulnerabilities and that your information will always be secure. When doing business with others, such as advertisers to whom you can link from our site, you should consider the separate security and privacy policies of those other sites.</p>

<p>Except as specifically permitted by this privacy policy or other instructions regarding the online services you may not, and will ensure that you do not, lend, give, or otherwise disclose any passcodes or passwords to any unauthorized person, or permit any unauthorized person to use your accounts or related passcodes or passwords.  Any loss of control of passcodes or passwords may result in the loss of control over personally identifiable information.  You will be responsible for any actions taken on your behalf or any person using your passcodes, passwords or user identifications.  If passcodes or passwords have been compromised for any reason, then you should immediately change such passcode or password or notify us so that we may issue a new passcode or password. </p> 

<p><b>Discussion Areas</b></p>

<p>This site may provide discussion areas so that customers and visitors can communicate freely and share ideas. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when disclosing such information. These discussion areas may be monitored by us or law enforcement officials as appropriate occasionally in order to enhance the safety and respect for all of our customers and visitors, and off-topic, unlawful or otherwise inappropriate content of materials of which we become aware may or may not be removed from the site during the course of such monitoring. However, Cbeyond Communications is not responsible for any information posted or remaining on these discussion areas.</p>

<p><b>Links to Other Sites</b></p>

<p>For the convenience of our visitors and customers, this Web site may contain links to other sites. While we generally try to link only to sites that share similar high standards and respect for privacy, we  have no responsibility or liability for the content, products or services offered, independent actions, or the privacy and security practices employed by these other independent sites.  We encourage you to ask questions and review the applicable privacy policies before disclosing information to third parties on these independent sites.  </p>

<p><b>Updates or Revisions to Personally Identifiable Information</b></p>

<p>Your use of certain of our online services may permit you to update personally identifiable information from our database by accessing our web site.  If you remove certain information from your account, we will only retain copies of such information as are necessary for us to comply with governmental orders, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, enforce any agreement you have entered into with us and as otherwise reasonably necessary.  </p>
