<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Links To Other Websites</u></strong><br>On this Site, we may provide as a convenience to you links to other websites, including sites operated by us, our partners, associates, or independent third parties.&nbsp; These links are provided as a convenience to you.&nbsp; Each website has its own privacy practices, as described in that site's privacy policy.&nbsp; Those practices may be different than the practices described herein, and we urge you to read each website's privacy policy carefully before you use or submit information to that site.&nbsp; Additionally, to the extent that you follow a link to a website operated by an independent third party, please be aware that we exercise no authority or control over that third party, and cannot and are not responsible for any information that you may submit at that site.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Cookies</u></strong><br>When you visit this Site, we leave a "Cookie" in the memory of your Web browser. The site will only function properly if Cookies are enabled. &nbsp;This Site uses persistent Cookies to authenticate you as a user and display content that is relevant and specific to you. &nbsp;Cookies are very small files that store information about your visit to and use of this Site. &nbsp;Most major commercial Internet sites use them and they make your Internet-surfing more useful and less time-consuming for you because they store information that is reusable each time you visit this Site, such as preferences you have chosen to share with us. &nbsp;Cookies cannot access and read the files on your hard drive and cannot be used as a virus. &nbsp;They do allow us to provide information and products that are more meaningful to you without asking you the same questions every time you visit us. &nbsp;You may get Cookies from our advertisers. &nbsp;We cannot pre-screen these Cookies since they come directly to you from other sites. &nbsp;We hope you will want the better service that Cookies allow, but if you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse Cookies. &nbsp;However by doing that, you may not be able to access this Site.</p>
