                        <p>CardBoardFish uses cookies and some other devices during 
                          your usage of the sites. CardBoardFish does not create 
                          a profile of individual users and visitors and does 
                          not target users depending on their usage of the site 
                          to protect their privacy. Third party advertisers, however, 
                          may create a profile of a user to determine what adverts 
                          are served to CardBoardFish users and where.<br>
                          <br>
                          <i>Cookies</i></p>
                        <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer 
                          tied to information about the user. We use session ID 
                          cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close 
                          the browser, the cookie simply terminates. By setting 
                          a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in 
                          a password more than once, thereby saving time while 
                          on our site. Your password is not stored in a cookie; 
                          instead the cookie stores the session ID. This is for 
                          your own security and privacy, and if users reject the 
                          cookie, the user will be limited in some areas of our 
                          site. For example, users may not be able to use registration 
                          systems such as CBFMail, or high security processes 
                          such as on CBFSMS or FRFL.<br>
                          <br>
                          Some of our business partners use cookies on our site 
                          (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access 
                          to or control over these cookies, once we have given 
                          permission for them to set cookies for advertising. 
                          The information stored by our advertisers is in no way 
                          linked to your personal information, which is kept completely 
                          private and secure at all times. <br>

                          address), and demographic information. Contact information 
                          will be used/shared with the competition/survey to notify

                        <p>CardBoardFish takes every precaution to protect our 
                          users’ information. When users submit sensitive information 
                          via the Web site, their information is protected both 
                          online and off-line. <br>
                          <br>
                          When our registration/order forms ask users to enter 
                          sensitive information (such as credit card number, the 
                          information is encrypted and is protected with the best 
                          encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on 
                          a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon 
                          on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator 
                          and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed 
                          to un-locked, invisible, or open, when users are just 
                          ‘surfing’. <br>
                          <br>
                          While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information 
                          online, we also do everything in our power to protect 
                          user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, 
                          not just the sensitive information mentioned above, 
                          is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need 
                          the information to perform a specific job (for example, 
                          our billing clerk or a customer service representative) 
                          are granted access to personally identifiable information. 
                          Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers 
                          when they leave their desk. When they return, they must 
                          re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. 
                          Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our 
                          security and privacy practices. Daily, as well as any 
                          time new policies are added, our employees are notified 
                          and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, 
                          and what they can do to ensure our users’ information 
                          is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally 
                          identifiable information are in a secure environment, 
                          and are protected from intrusion by a state-of-the-art

                          and other places we deem appropriate so our users are 
                          always aware of what information we collect, how we

                          users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice 
                          we will also email users, who have opted to receive 
                          communications from us, notifying them of the changes
