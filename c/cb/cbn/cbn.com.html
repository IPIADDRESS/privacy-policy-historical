    <br>
    <b>Information You Give Us:</b> <br>
    We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You may choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, matching your partner information with your community profile, and communicating with you.<br>
    <br>
    <b>What About Cookies?</b><br>
    Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your Community log in. Without Cookies you will not be able to log in. Cookies also allow information to be retained between visits. If you click the “remember me” option, it will set a log in Cookie to automatically log you in every time you visit the site.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Does CBN.com Share the Information It Receives?</b><br>
    Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries CBN.com, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b> Agents:</b> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, and processing credit card payments. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</li>
        <li><b> Promotional Offers:</b> Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of CBN.com users. </li>
        <li><b> Protection of CBN.com and Others:</b> We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of CBN.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>How Secure Is Information About Me?</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li> We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
