                                This privacy statement is applicable to all CBC 
                                web-sites.</p>
                              <p>The CBC respects the privacy of its Internet 
                                users and will protect that privacy as vigorously 
                                as possible.</p>
                              <p>CBC does not collect information that personally 
                                identifies individuals except when individuals 
                                provide such specific information on a voluntary 
                                basis. There may be occasions where specific personal 
                                information is requested before an individual 
                                can enter certain sections of a CBC site. For 
                                example, registration is needed to enter the Fantasy 
                                Pool of the Hockey Night in Canada site or to 
                                participate in any CBC online forum. This kind 
                                of registration helps us to ensure that content 
                                standards on these sections of the site are rigorously 
                                upheld or that contact can be made with prize 
                                winners. Information requested in order to personalize 
                                the CBC.ca homepage or any other CBC site section 
                                would be a similar example.</p>
                              <p>In all such cases, CBC will collect only information 
                                that is voluntarily provided by the user and undertakes 
                                that such information will be kept strictly confidential. 
                                Individual information provided to the CBC to 
                                gain access to any CBC site will not be sold or 
                                made available to a third party. </p>
                              <p>CBC does reserve the right, however, to perform 
                                statistical analyses of user behaviour and characteristics, 
                                in order to measure interest in and use of the 
                                various sections of its sites so as to improve 
                                design and navigation and to gather marketing 
                                information. Only aggregated data from these analyses, 
                                not individual data, will be used for this purpose.</p>
                              <p>As well, users should be aware that certain non-personal 
                                information and data may be automatically collected 
                                by the CBC through the operation of what are called 
                                "cookies". "Cookies" are small 
                                text files that identify an individual computer's 
                                browser entering a web site. They allow the site 
                                to track that browser's movement through the site 
                                over several sessions. Through cookies, a web 
                                site can recognize repeat users, facilitate the 
                                user's access to and use of the site and allow 
                                a site to track usage behaviour that will allow 
                                content improvements. The CBC uses cookies only 
                                for the above-mentioned purposes and will not 
                                use them to identify users or to track non-CBC
