                            <p>All CBC/Radio-Canada employees, who collect, maintain and/or use personal information, are responsible for insuring that the collection, use and disclosure of this information is carried out in accordance with this policy and relevant procedures.</p>

                            <p> This privacy statement is applicable to all CBC web-sites.</p>
    
                            <p>The CBC respects the privacy of its Internet users and will protect that privacy as vigorously as possible.</p>
                            
                            <p>CBC does not collect information that personally identifies individuals except when individuals provide such specific information on a voluntary basis. There may be occasions where specific personal information is requested before an individual can enter certain sections of a CBC site. For example, registration is needed to enter the Fantasy Pool of the Hockey Night in Canada site or to participate in any CBC online forum. This kind of registration helps us to ensure that content standards on these sections of the site are rigorously upheld or that contact can be made with prize winners. Information requested in order to personalize the CBC.ca homepage or any other CBC site section would be a similar example.</p>
                            
                            <p>In all such cases, CBC will collect only information that is voluntarily provided by the user and undertakes that such information will be kept strictly confidential. Individual information provided to the CBC to gain access to any CBC site will not be sold or made available to a third party.</p>
                            
                            <p>CBC does reserve the right, however, to perform statistical analyses of user behaviour and characteristics, in order to measure interest in and use of the various sections of its sites so as to improve design and navigation and to gather marketing information. Only aggregated data from these analyses, not individual data, will be used for this purpose.</p>
                            
                            <p>As well, users should be aware that certain non-personal information and data may be automatically collected by the CBC through the operation of what are called "cookies". "Cookies" are small text files that identify an individual computer's browser entering a web site. They allow the site to track that browser's movement through the site over several sessions. Through cookies, a web site can recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's access to and use of the site and allow a site to track usage behaviour that will allow content improvements. The CBC uses cookies only for the above-mentioned purposes and will not use them to identify users or to track non-CBC usage.</p>
                            
                            <p>If you do not want a cookie placed on your computer by the CBC, you may disable cookies altogether by modifying the Preferences section of your Netscape or Internet Explorer browser (under Edit/Preferences/Advanced). Note that it is possible that some aspects of CBC sites may be unavailable to you if you choose this option.</p>
                            
                            <p>If you have no problem accepting cookies, but wish to be informed of their appearance, you may turn on a warning prompt by modifying the cookie warning section in Edit/Preferences/Advanced.</p>

                           <p>CBC's privacy provisions are based on the CSA International's Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information, recognized as a national standard in 1996. The standard addresses the ways in which organizations collect, use and disclose personal information. It also addresses the rights of individuals to have access to their personal information and to have it corrected if necessary.</p>
    
                            <p>The code's 10 principles are:</p>
                          
                            <p><strong>Accountability</strong></p>
                            <p>An organization is responsible for personal information under its control and shall designate an individual or individuals who are accountable for the organization's compliance with these principles.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Identifying Purposes</strong></p>
                            <p>The purposes for which personal information is collected shall be identified by the organization at or before the time the information is collected.</p>              
                            
                            <p><strong>Consent</strong></p>
                            <p>The knowledge and consent of the individual are required for the collection, use or disclosure of personal information, except where inappropriate.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Limiting Collection</strong></p>
                            <p>The collection of personal information shall be limited to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by the organization. Information shall be collected by fair and lawful means.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention</strong></p>
                            <p>Personal information shall not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required by law. Personal information shall be retained only as long as necessary for the fulfilment of these purposes.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>
                            <p>Personal information shall be as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Safeguards</strong></p>
                            <p>Personal information shall be protected by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Openness</strong></p>
                            <p>An organization shall make readily available to individuals specific information about its policies and practices relating to the management of personal information.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Individual Access</strong></p>
                            <p>Upon request, an individual shall be informed of the existence, use and disclosure of his or her personal information and shall be given access to that information. An individual shall be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and have it amended as appropriate.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Challenging Compliance</strong></p>
                            <p>An individual shall be able to address a challenge concerning compliance with the above principles to the designated individual or individuals accountable for the organization's compliance.</p>
