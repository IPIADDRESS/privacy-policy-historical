<p>This notice describes who we are, why we need to collect your information and how we will use it. </p><br>

<p><strong>Why we need your information </strong></p><br>

<p>We will use your information to give you quotations, and manage your insurance policy, including underwriting and claims handling. </p><br>
<p>Your information comprises of all the details we hold about you and your transactions and includes information we obtain about you from third parties. </p><br>
<p>We will only collect the information we need so that we can provide you with the service you expect from us.</p><br> 
<p>From time to time we may need to change the way we use your information. Where we believe you may not reasonably expect such a change we will write to you. When we do so, you will have 60 days to object to the change but if we do not hear from you within that time you consent to that change.</p><br>

<p><strong>Who we will share your information with </strong></p><br>

<p>Churchill insurance policies are underwritten by U K Insurance Limited (UKI).  When you give us your information, it will be shared within the UKI owned brands. We will do that in order to provide you with the best possible products and service experience. </p><br>

<p>During the course of our dealings with you we may need to disclose some of your information to other insurers, third party underwriters, reinsurers, credit reference and fraud prevention and law prevention agencies and other companies that provide service to us or you, to:

</p><ul class="black_bullets">
<li>assess financial and insurance risks</li>
<li>recover debt</li>
<li>prevent and detect crime</li>
<li>develop our products, services, systems and relationships with you</li>
<li>understand our customersâ€™ requirements</li>
<li>rating and pricing.</li></ul><p></p><br>

<p>We do not disclose your information to anyone outside the Group except where:
</p><ul class="black_bullets">
<li>we have your permission</li>
<li>we are required or permitted to do so by law</li>
<li>we may transfer rights and obligations under this agreement</li></ul><p></p><br>

<p><strong>Where we transfer your information </strong></p><br>

<p>From time to time we may require services from suppliers that are based worldwide and your information will be shared with them for the purposes of providing that service. Where we engage these suppliers we make sure that they apply the same levels of protection, security and confidentiality we apply.  However, such information may be accessed by law enforcement agencies and other authorities to prevent and detect crime and comply with legal obligations.</p><br>

<p><strong>Motor Insurance Database (MID)</strong></p><br>

<p>Information relating to your policy will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID) managed by the Motor Insurersâ€™ Bureau (MIB). The MID and the data stored on it may be used by certain statutory and/or authorised bodies including the Police, the DVLA, the DVANI, the Insurance Fraud Bureau and other bodies permitted by law for purposes not limited to but including:
</p><ul class="black_bullets">
<li>Electronic Licensing (Tax Discs);</li>
<li>Continuous Insurance Enforcement;</li>
<li>Law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and/or prosecution of offenders);</li>
<li>The provision of government services and/or other services aimed at reducing the level and incidence of uninsured driving.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>If you are involved in a road traffic accident (either in the UK, the EEA or certain other territories), insurers and/or the MIB may search the MID to obtain relevant information.</p><br>

<p>Persons (including his or her appointed representatives) pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID.</p><br>

<p>It is vital that the MID holds your correct registration number. It is our responsibility to update your policy to the MID. We fully comply with the agreements in place with the MIB to update your details within seven days; however it is important that you check your policy documents ensuring that the registration number is recorded correctly.</p><br>

<p>If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your car seized by the Police. You can check that your correct registration number is shown on the MID at <a title="www.askMID.com (opens in a new window)" href="http://www.askMID.com/" target="_blank">www.askMID.com</a>.</p><br>

<p>If the registration number is not shown correctly on your policy documents, or you cannot find your car on the MID, please contact us immediately.</p><br>
<p><strong>Sensitive Information</strong></p><br>

<p>Some of the personal information we ask you for may be sensitive personal information, as defined by the Data Protection Act 1998 (such as information about health or criminal convictions). We will not use such sensitive personal data about you or others except for the specific purpose for which you provide it and to provide the services described in your policy documents.</p><br>
<p>You will have been asked to agree to this when you first contacted us but please ensure that you only provide us with sensitive information about other people with their agreement.</p><br>

<p><strong>Dealing with other people</strong></p><br>

<p>It is our policy to deal with your spouse or partner who calls us on your behalf, provided they are named on the policy.  If you would like someone else to deal with your policy on your behalf on a regular basis please let us know.  In some exceptional cases we may also deal with other people who call on your behalf, with your consent. If at any time you would prefer us to deal only with you, please let us know.</p><br>

<p><strong>Credit Reference Agencies</strong></p><br>

<p>UKI carries out a consumer search when any application for insurance is submitted. This is done using public data to evaluate insurance risks and no financial information is reviewed as part of this process. There is no visible credit footprint and after 12 months is automatically deleted.</p><br>

<p><strong>Keeping you informed</strong></p><br>

<p>From time to time we may contact you with special offers or suggest products which may be of interest to you. If you would like not to receive any of these updates you can ask us to stop at any time. You can do that by simply calling our customers services department or by writing to the Data Protection Officer at Churchill Court, Westmoreland Road, Bromley BR1 1DP. </p><br>
 
<p><strong>Access to your information</strong></p><br>

<p>You have the right to see the information we hold about you. This is called Subject Access Request. If you would like a copy of your information, please write to: 
The Data Protection Officer, Churchill Court, Westmoreland Road, Bromley BR1 1DP quoting your reference. A fee may be payable.</p><br>

<p>Please take time to read the following as it contains important information relating to the details you have given or should give to us. You should show this notice to anyone whose data has been supplied to us in connection with your policy.</p><br>

<p>To prevent and detect fraud we may at any time:</p><br>

<p>Share information with other organisations and public bodies including the police although we only do so in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998</p><br>

<p>Check and/or file details with fraud prevention agencies and databases and if we are given false or inaccurate information and we identify fraud, we will record this. We and other organisations may also use and search these agencies and databases from the UK and other countries to:
</p><ul class="black_bullets">
<li>help make decisions about the provision and administration of insurance, credit and related services for you and members of your household:</li>
<li>trace debtors or beneficiaries, recover debt, prevent fraud, and to manage your accounts or insurance policies; or</li>
<li>check your identity to prevent money laundering, unless you provide us with other satisfactory proof of identity</li></ul><p></p><br>

<p>Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.</p><br>

<p>We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example when:

</p><ul class="black_bullets">
<li>Checking applications for, and managing credit and other facilities and recovering debt</li>
<li>Checking insurance proposals and claims;</li>
<li>Checking details of job applicants and employees.</li></ul><p></p><br>

<strong>Security</strong><br>

<p>Any personal data saved is held safely on our mainframe computer, with security systems preventing unauthorised access and we always ensure it is treated confidentially. For further information regarding our security provisions please see our note titled Further Security.</p><p><br>

<strong>Further Security</strong><br>

</p><p>We take security very seriously and we use one of the strongest available security systems to protect your communications with us. Whenever you fill in a form, such as a request for a quote, it is automatically protected using something called a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) between your computer and ours. SSL works in the following ways:
It prevents impersonation - you can tell that you are using a genuine SSL site by the padlock symbol at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on either the padlock or the image opposite will reveal our Registration Certificate that is issued by Verisign, a leading Internet security company.*
It encrypts data - as soon as your computer has recognised our computer they encrypt all information that is passed between them. Data encryption means that no one else can read or change your information as it travels over the Internet.
It prevents scrambling - SSL uses a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to prevent anyone tampering with our Internet site. Your computer will always check this code before it takes a message from us. This means that if anyone tried to interfere with a message, your computer would not recognise the code and would alert you.</p><p><br>

</p><p>*There are two minor problems with Microsoft Internet Explorer. Neither problem has any effect on the actual security in force, but may make it appear to you as if it is not fully secure.
Internet Explorer 4. The padlock symbol does not always appear at the bottom when it should. A full description of this error, number Q154621, is at <a title="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q154/6/21.asp (opens in a new window)" href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q154/6/21.asp" target="_blank">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q154/6/21.asp</a>.</p><p><br>

</p><p>Internet Explorer 5. If you click on the padlock symbol to view the security certificate the following message may be displayed: "This certificate has failed to verify for all of its intended purposes". The other details of the certificate shown are correct. A full description of this error, number Q233479, is at <a title="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q233/4/79.asp (opens in a new window)" href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q233/4/79.asp" target="_blank">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q233/4/79.asp</a>.</p>
