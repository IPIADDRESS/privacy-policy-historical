The chart lists the names of some of our third party partners and support provider entities, which may provide administrative services to our Websites. These entities may change from time to time.
<span class="margin-space"></span>
If you have any inquiries regarding our partner’s privacy practices or how they use your child’s personal information, please contact us directly at <a href="mailto:guestrelations@cecentertainment.com">guestrelations@cecentertainment.com</a>.

</p>
<p>
<span class="margin-space">User Access and Choice</span>
If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update, or request deletion of personally identifiable information collected by contacting us by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:guestrelations@cecentertainment.com">guestrelations@cecentertainment.com</a> or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.  To safeguard your information, we will also take steps to verify your identity before granting access or correction. Although we do not seek to collect information from children, parents may, after providing proper parental identification, request to review, update, or delete their own child's information that may have been submitted.
<span class="margin-space"></span>
To remove images from the site, we will send an email to the user with a link for removal and then proceed with deletion if the link is clicked on and deletion confirmed on that webpage. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<p>
<span>Opt-out Preferences</span><br>
Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails. We do send transactional emails when processing your orders and responding to your feedback/questions.  You may not opt out of these emails as they are not promotional in nature.
</p>

<p>
<span>Surveys</span><br>
We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as ZIP code).
<span class="margin-space"></span>
We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), to send participants an email newsletter, or contact if there are issues.
<span class="margin-space"></span>
We may use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.
</p>
<p>
<span>Tracking Technologies</span><br>
Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts are used by us and our tracking utility company who provides online customer support.  These technologies are used in improving the user experience for completing forms for the reservation process, tracking behaviors so that we can provide relevant messaging and improve the overall experience, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
</p>

<p>
<span>Analytics / Log Files</span><br>
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 
<span class="margin-space"></span>
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 
<span class="margin-space"></span>
We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. This data is used to track Internet usage and behavior so that we can retarget you with relevant messaging and to improve the user experience.
</p>

<p>
<span>Local Storage Objects (HTML5)</span><br>
Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as Flash LSOs.

Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.
</p>

<p>
<span>Mobile Analytics</span><br>
We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile application, as we do not collect any personal information through the application.
</p>
<p>
<span>Security</span><br>
The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:guestrelations@cecentertainment.com">guestrelations@cecentertainment.com</a>.
