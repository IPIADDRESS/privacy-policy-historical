<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Combining  Information.</em></strong>&nbsp; Please note that all of the information we  collect about you may be combined, including to help us tailor our  communications to you and to develop rich online content and services across  the Salem Websites.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Public Forums.</em></strong>&nbsp; This Website  makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its  users.&nbsp; Any information you disclose in  these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when  deciding to disclose your personal information.&nbsp;  We cannot safeguard the privacy of any such information you choose to  disclose online in this manner and you must do so carefully and at your own  risk.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>User-Generated  Content.</em></strong>&nbsp; Some Salem Websites enable users to submit  their own content for contests, blogs, videos, message boards and other  functions.&nbsp; Publication of user generated  content on the Salem Websites is subject to the terms and rules contained in  our Terms of Use for our Websites.&nbsp;  Please remember that any information you disclose becomes public  information and exercise caution when deciding to disclose your contact,  financial and other information in a submission.&nbsp; We cannot prevent such information from being  used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law, or your  personal privacy and safety.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Banner  Advertising.</em></strong>&nbsp; We license ad-server software from another  company to place banner advertising on our Websites. &nbsp;All of the data provided and generated by such  software will remain in our possession and no data will be transferred to the  licensor of the software.&nbsp; This feature  of our Websites may, on occasion, set “cookies” on your computer.&nbsp; Any information collected or stored by the  ad-service or the cookies is treated in the same manner as other information as  described in this statement.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Confirmed  Opt-In.</em></strong>&nbsp; Salem acquires no personal or registration  data about our users except what you explicitly and voluntarily provide (i.e., via  opt-in). &nbsp;We reserve the right to use  this information specifically for the purposes related to your registration in  addition to any other purpose set forth in this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Feedback Data.</em></strong>&nbsp; Feedback data  is voluntary information (e.g., success stories) provided directly by you for  the purposes of assessing the products or services provided through Salem Websites.  There are areas on Salem-owned Websites which allow you to submit feedback. &nbsp;Any feedback you submit in these areas becomes  the property of Salem, and we reserve the right to use this information for the  purposes of marketing, quality control, or to contact you for further  information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Usage (Log)  Data.&nbsp; </em></strong>Salem also gathers and analyzes usage or log data  including your IP (internet protocol) address assigned by your ISP (internet  service provider), the type of operating system you are using on your computer,  and the type of web browser you are using to view our Website. Salem management  uses usage or log data to help diagnose problems with and optimize performance  of the server. &nbsp;This information also  allows us to evaluate user traffic patterns into, out from, and within our Website.  These uses, however, do not allow us to connect your IP address with your  personal identity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>What About “Cookies”?</em></strong>&nbsp; “Cookies” are  small pieces of information that your web browser stores on your computer's  hard drive which may contain personally identifying information. &nbsp;From time to time our Website may place  cookies on your computer’s hard drive that enable our systems to recognize your  browser and to provide you with certain features. Use of cookies also provides  information about your web usage, which helps us compile demographic and  statistical information about visitors who are utilizing our Website. &nbsp;Most web browsers automatically accept  cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.<strong>&nbsp; <u>Updating  and Deleting Personal Data</u>:<u></u></strong></p>

</ul>
<p>4.&nbsp; <strong><u>Information Shared With Third Parties</u>:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Information  Sharing With Third Parties.</em></strong>&nbsp; We allow  third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our Websites  for their own use and subject to their own privacy policies. These companies  may utilize cookies, pixels or other technologies to collect and use  non-personally identifiable information (e.g., hashed data, click stream  information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or  scrolled over) during your visits to this and other web sites in order to  provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater  interest to you.&nbsp; To learn more about  this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising,  you can visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance at  www.aboutads.info and Networking Advertising Initiative at  www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally,  from time to time we may enter into a special relationship with another company  that is not owned by Salem to provide additional features on our Websites.&nbsp; These special relationships may include  “powered by” partners, business partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred  to here as “co-branded pages”). You should look for a specific privacy  statement on any such co-branded page. Any personal information that you  provide when signing up at one of those co-branded pages may be shared with our  third party partner.&nbsp; You should also  check our partner’s website for information regarding its privacy  policies.&nbsp; Additionally, the nature of  some features of our Website may require that we share personal information  about you with persons or companies outside of the Salem corporate  enterprise.&nbsp; For example, this may occur  with a feature that enables you, via our Website, to ask questions of persons  or entities that are not part of the Salem enterprise.&nbsp; By responding to those features of the  Website, whether by email or direct entry of information on our Website, you  are consenting to our transferring of that information to such persons or  entities. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Links to  Other Sites.</em></strong>&nbsp; When you visit Salem Websites,  you may be linked to other outside sites. This includes links to sites operated  by advertisers, sponsors, and partners that may use Salem's logo as part of an  agreement with Salem. These other sites may send their own cookies to users,  collect data, or solicit Your Information. These other sites may be developed  by people over whom Salem exercises no control and, as such, are not subject to  the Salem Privacy Policy. Salem is not responsible for the privacy policies of  these other sites, nor for the use of any of Your Information that these sites  may collect.</li>
