      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      <p>
        To make this document easier to read, we’re going to use some shorthand throughout. For example, when we say “CHOP” or “the Platform” we’re talking about the web-based online ministry application tool described and accessible at <a href="https://churchonlineplatform.com">https://churchonlineplatform.com</a>. The Platform is part of a suite of software products and services owned and operated by Life Covenant Church, Inc., which we’ll refer to as “Life.Church,” “us,” or “we” throughout this policy. The Platform is intended for use by non-profit institutions and use of the Platform requires registration by an account administrator.  We call those non-profit institutions as well as their administrators and registered users “Members.” Unregistered internet users that are merely browsing Platform sites are called “Visitors”.  When we refer to both in this policy, we’ll use the term “you.” In using the Platform, Members are able to create websites that have their own respective users through which Members may collect information from third parties that use the Members’ websites.  We call these Member websites “Your Websites” and the third parties that use those websites “Your Users”.

        Analytics and Performance
      </h3>
      <p>
        We desire to see online church engagement increase throughout the world.  We use the personal data available to us to observe social, economic, and geographic trends as they pertain to online ministry. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under controls that are designed to protect your privacy. We publish or allow others to publish our insights but only in an aggregated form that does not disclose your personally identifiable information. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about overall usage of the Platform worldwide and in specific countries and geographic regions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use de-identified and aggregate user data to market the Platform, such as celebrating the total number of users across the Platform.  We use data, including user-provided personal information, aggregations of user data, data collected through use of the Platform, public feedback and information inferred from this data to conduct internal research and development in order to provide a better overall Platform experience, measure the performance of the Platform and increase use of the Platform and its features. This is done by making changes to the Platform that are generally available, as well as sending users messages suggesting Platform functionality and content.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Security and Technical Issues
      </h4>

    <article>
      <h3>
        Information You Provide to Us
      </h3>
      <p>
        Visitors do not need to submit personal information to us to view the websites that describe our Platform.  You do not have to become a Platform Member to view Your Website or another website created by another Member using the Platform. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You do need to become a Member and create a Platform account to create and administer Your Websites via the Platform. To become a Member, you are required to create an account and provide certain information such as your administrator's name and email address, your business name and website URL, and the state or country in which you are located.  This information is collected, stored and used by Life.Church to facilitate your use of the Platform, maintain the security of Your Websites, prevent unauthorized administration of Your Websites, and for our other legitimate business purposes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond this required information, you have choices about whether to provide additional information to be associated with your Member account.  We collect personal data from you when you provide, post, or upload it to the Platform. You do not have to provide such information; however, if you do not, it may limit our ability to personalize or fully support the Platform and your ability to use the Platform to its fullest extent.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>
        Information You Collect from Your Users 
      </h3>
      <p>
        You also have choices about what information you collect from and use, share and otherwise process about Your Users.  We facilitate this collection, use and sharing based on the choices you make to facilitate your use of the Platform.  Your Websites may operate without Your Users’ personal information; however, use of Your Users’ information allows you to personalize Your Websites and use the Platform to its fullest extent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based upon the choices you make, Your Users will have options as to what information they provide through Your Websites.  For example, the Platform will allow you to provide Your Users the option to link Your Websites on the Platform with other websites, applications, and services or profiles Your Users may have with third party applications.  If you allow this option and Your Users choose to link with these third party applications and services, Your Users will provide you and us the personal data stored on those applications to the Platform and Life.Church. For example, Your User may create an account on Your Website by linking their Facebook account to the Platform, providing personal information they have opted to share through Facebook to you and Life.Church through the Platform.

      </h3>
      <p>
        When the Platform allows you to provide information to be published, distributed, or displayed on Your Website or for you to allow Your Users to publish, distribute or display information on Your Websites, we refer to that as “posted,” which can be on public areas of the Platform, Your Websites  or transmitted to other users of the Platform or third parties, all of which we’ll call “User Contributions.” For example, these include activities such as posting church-specific information, contributing messages to chat, and posting video/audio/graphical assets.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Please keep in mind that if you or Your Users disclose personal information in a public manner whether through chat postings, social media, message boards, or other public online forums, this information may be collected and used by others. User Contributions are posted and transmitted at the contributor’s sole risk. We cannot control the actions of other users or third parties with whom you or Your Users choose to share User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons, nor do we accept any liability associated with User Contributions.

Cookies and similar technologies help to facilitate the best possible user experience of the Platform as they allow us to recognize and maintain user preferences from session to session, help us keep accounts safe, and generally improve the functionality of the products and services offered through the Platform. They also help us ensure that Member information is used in association with the correct Member account. Cookies also enable us to maintain preferences of Your Users on Your Website from session to session and to ensure that Your Users’ information is used in association with their account, if any, on Your Websites.  Importantly, we do not use cookies or similar technologies to facilitate interest-based ads from third parties.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Deletion:  You or Your Users may ask us to erase or delete all or some of the personal data we have about you or Your Users . Please note that doing so may limit the ability to use certain functionality of the Platform. Please note that an email address is required to have a Member account.
        </li>
        <li>
          Correction/Modification: You or Your Users may edit some of the personal data associated with accounts on the Platform or Your Websites or ask us to change, update, or fix that data in certain cases, including if it’s inaccurate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data: You or Your Users can ask us to stop using all or some of the personal data we have about you or Your Users  (for example, if you have no legal basis to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (for example, if we come to believe that personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).
        </li>
        <li>
          Right to Access and/or Take Your Data: You or Your Users can ask us for a copy of the personal data of you or Your Users that has been provided to us.
