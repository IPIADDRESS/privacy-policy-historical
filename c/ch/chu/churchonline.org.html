					</li>

					How do we use your information?
				</h3>

					How do we share your information?
				</h3>
				<p>
					LifeChurch.tv does not share your personal information with other institutions outside of LifeChurch.tv without your explicit consent.

				<p>

Unless explicit permission is obtained from you, LifeChurch.tv restricts access to personal information to LifeChurch.tv employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

				<h3>
					Data Integrity
				</h3>
				<p>
					LifeChurch.tv reviews our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services.

				<h3>
					Accessing and updating personal information
				</h3>
				<p>
					When you use any LifeChurch.tv service, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate service purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal information. You are solely responsible for ensuring that any data you provide to LifeChurch.tv is complete and accurate. If we determine information you provide is not complete or accurate, we may terminate your access to the LifeChurch.tv services.
