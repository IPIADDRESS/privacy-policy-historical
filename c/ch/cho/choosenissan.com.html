          <p>Last modified: December 5, 2016</p>
            <h2 class="heading-second text-center">We Value Your Privacy</h2>
              <p>Nissan North America, Inc. (“Nissan” or “we”) values your privacy, and we want you to know that your information is handled with care and in accordance with applicable laws.  This Privacy Policy addresses personal information that we collect, use and share through websites operated by Nissan, as well as through Nissan vehicles and services.  Our financial services subsidiary, Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation, maintains its own separate privacy policy that can be found <a href="https://www.nissanfinance.com/Privacy?ln=en">here</a>.</p>


            <h2 class="heading-second">INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH NISSAN WEBSITE<br></h2>
              <p>Nissan collects information from you at various points on our websites. Nissan is the sole owner of the information collected on its websites (except that Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation owns information collected from credit pre-approval applications). We will not sell or rent this information to others. We will only share this information with our affiliates and dealers, marketing partners, and other vendors contracted to do business on our behalf.  By using Nissan websites and providing your personal information, you agree to the collection and use of your information as stated in this Privacy Policy.</p>
              <p>If you provide your Social Security number to us, we will (1) Protect the confidentiality of the Social Security number, (2) prohibit unlawful disclosure of the Social Security number, and (3) limit access to the Social Security number.</p>
              <p>Nissan collects and uses two types of information on our websites: anonymous information gathered from cookies and log files, and personal information you provide us for certain services. </p>
            <h3 class="heading-third" style="text-transform: none;">Anonymous Information - Cookies and Log
              Files<br></h3>
              <p>Nissan may use third party providers to collect and record data on the use and performance of our websites during your visit (“Usage Data”), which may include without limitation the pages you view, the search terms you enter, your IP address, and personal information that you submit through the website. Usage Data may be collected by Nissan or its third party provider through “cookies”, log files and other technology. Nissan uses this information to administer its websites and to improve the services provided to you. Nissan may share information collected through our websites with suppliers to provide services for us or as required by law or court order. Nissan may also share Usage Data in an aggregate statistic format with a third party; such statistics would not include personal information. Nissan does not rent, sell, or trade Usage Data outside of Nissan.</p>
              <p>Nissan may not respond to “do not track” beacons, tags or other such signals including browser-based prompts or controls. You may also receive tracking mechanisms from other parties prior to visiting our websites that will continue to track your activity while on our websites. Such data would be subject to the privacy policy of the other party from whom you received the mechanism, and we do not control or receive data from such mechanisms. For more information on how to manage advertising controls including tracking mechanisms, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</a></p>
              <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to personal information, until a user provides that information (see below). If a user rejects or deletes the cookie, he/she may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able to receive notification of special offers, or participate in any contests that may take place. Cookies also enable us to track and aggregate clickstream behavior data. By doing this we can better target the interests of our users and enhance their experience on our site.</p>
              <p>Nissan also maintains standard web logs that record data about all visitors to our websites. These logs may contain:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The Internet domain from which you access the website.</li>
                  <li>Your IP address (Your computer is automatically assigned an IP address when you surf the Internet. Your IP address is either static or dynamic. A static IP address may be identifiable to you; a dynamic address is usually not identifiable to you.)</li>
                  <li>The type of browser and operating system you use.</li>
                  <li>The date and time you visited the website.</li>
                  <li>The pages you viewed on the website.</li>
                  <li>The address of the website from which you linked.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Nissan uses web log and clickstream information to help us design our site, to identify popular site features and to make the site more useful for visitors. Web logs are recorded in sequential files, and we normally do not attempt to identify individuals from these logs. However, we may use web logs to identify persons attempting to break into, disrupt, or damage our Site. We may share web log information with law enforcement personnel if we believe evidence exists, or is likely to occur, of a violation of federal, state or local laws or regulations.</p>
                <p>Nissan advertising at other non-Nissan sites may be serviced by Nissan service providers, who may use cookies to collect information about your visits to those sites. Information collected may include the pages visited, date and time, browser information and/or IP address. We normally make no attempt to link this information to you personally, except under circumstances described above. This information is gathered in order to help us customize and target our advertising to the needs and interests of our customers. If you wish to opt out of this tracking at our advertising at third party sites, please visit the following sites:<br>
                  </p><ul style="list-style:none;">
                  <li><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Network
          Advertising</a></li>
                  <li><a href="http://www.112.2o7.net/optout.html" target="_blank">Omniture</a><p></p></li>
                  </ul>
              <h3 class="heading-third" style="text-transform: none;">Personal Information You Provide</h3>
                <p>You may choose to volunteer personal information (name, email address, phone number, etc.) in order for us to provide you with services such as brochure and information requests, surveys and contests, site announcements, special offers at the time of the request or in the future, etc. If you would like to have your email address removed from our list, click the <a href="http://www.nnainfo.com/email/unsubscribenissan.aspx?x" target="_blank">“<i><u>unsubscribe</u></i>”</a> link included in our email message to you. Or you can call or send regular mail to remove yourself from the list (see contact information below).</p>
                <p>As stated above, Nissan does not sell or rent your information to any third parties. We share your information with our affiliates and dealers, marketing partners and other vendors contracted to do business on our behalf. When you sign up for certain services and offers on our websites, we will share your name and other contact information necessary to provide these services to you. Nissan will share your information in accordance with the privacy policy in effect at the time your information is collected.</p>
                <p>If your personal information changes, email <a href="mailto:privacy@nissan-usa.com">privacy@nissan-usa.com</a> or contact Nissan Consumer Affairs as outlined below.  We will endeavor to correct or update the personal data you provide to us promptly.</p>
                <p>If you elect to email a friend from our websites, a function available from the Design Your Vehicle page, we ask for the friend's email address. Nissan captures this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.</p>

              <h3 class="heading-third" style="text-transform: none;">Website Security</h3>
                <p>Nissan takes all reasonable precautions to protect information transmitted through our websites, both while the information is being transmitted and after it is received by us.</p>
                <p>When our credit pre-approval form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as social security number), that information is encrypted and securely transmitted according to industry standards for reputable organizations. While on a secure page, such as our credit pre-approval application form, you should see a lock icon or similar indicator that our site is secured as well as an “https” at the beginning of the website address.  For more information on the Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation (NMAC) privacy notice, see "NMAC Privacy Policy" below.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, once your information has been received by us, we use security procedures and policies commensurate with industry standards to safeguard against loss, theft, unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification and disclosure. If you have any questions about the security of our websites, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@nissan-usa.com">privacy@nissan-usa.com</a>.</p>

              <h3 class="heading-third" style="text-transform: none;">Links to Other Websites</h3>
                <p>This Web site contains links to other websites. Please be aware that Nissan is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each website that collects personal information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by websites controlled and operated by Nissan.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>We may also use your information to share with companies affiliated with Nissan for joint marketing initiatives, subject to applicable law or your consent where required. We will not share personal information with any other marketers for their own use without your express consent. This list is not meant to be exhaustive.</p>
            <p>You understand that, for quality assurance purposes, we (including our third party service providers) may monitor and record conversations between our (including our third party service providers) respective response centers and the vehicle occupants. We (including our third party service providers) may also monitor and record any calls coming into our (including our third party service providers) response centers from any source. Therefore, for yourself, the occupants and anyone contacting us on your behalf, you: (i) consent to all such monitoring and recording and, (ii) release us, third party beneficiaries and any wireless carrier(s) from claims, liabilities and losses that may result from any such monitored and/or recorded conversations.</p>
            <p>We may use your information for any purpose or share it with any third party if we anonymize the information so that it no longer reasonably identifies you or your vehicle. Anonymization requires altering your information so re-identification requires use of only non-public sources. Wherever possible, we require third party service provider use of the information to be anonymized or protected in accordance with our information security policies. We limit who we share your information with and the legitimate business purposes for which it can be used.</p>

          <h2 class="heading-second">SAFEGUARDING YOUR INFORMATION<br></h2>
            <p>We are committed to keeping your personal information secure. We have appropriate technical, administrative and physical procedures and information security policies in place to safeguard your information from loss, misuse, or alteration. We limit access to personal information to individuals who have a business need consistent with the reason the information was provided. Wherever possible, we require our third party service providers to protect your information in accordance with our information security policies.</p>
            <p>Because certain communications and information collected from your vehicle is provided through wireless and satellite networks, we cannot promise or guarantee that the communications will not be intercepted by others. You agree that Nissan will not be liable for any damages for any loss of privacy occurring in communication over such networks.</p>
            <p>We may keep the information we collect until we no longer need the information to provide services to you, to operate our business, to enable us to communicate with you, for our research, evaluation of use, or troubleshooting purposes, for our analysis to improve vehicle quality or services, or to satisfy our legal or contractual obligations.</p>

          <h2 class="heading-second">YOUR CHOICES ABOUT COLLECTION, USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION<br></h2>

            <p>We may also disclose any data, whether personally identifiable or not, when required to do so by subpoena, court order, or warrant. Whenever feasible, Nissan will notify you by email if such disclosure will affect you.</p>
            <p>We may also disclose any data, whether personally identifiable or not, when we reasonably deem it necessary to protect the safety of (i) an individual, (ii) the public, or (iii) the security and reliability of Nissan and/or this website.</p>

            <p>Nissan reserves the right to update its Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will post those changes to this page so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. We will use, share, and disclose all information in accordance with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the information was collected. If a material change is made, we will post a notice on the Privacy Policy page of our website along with the updated Privacy Policy or, where required by law, obtain your consent.
