	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>ChooseWhat.com takes your privacy seriously. Our privacy policy is  designed to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding  the collection and use of the information we collect. We encourage you  to read our full privacy policy, below:<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Information Collected</strong><strong><br>
		<br>
		</strong>ChooseWhat.com does not collect any <em>personally identifiable information </em>about  individuals, except when such information is voluntarily submitted by the user.<br>
		<br>
In common with many websites, ChooseWhat.com automatically logs certain <em>non-personally  identifiable information </em>about visits to our websites. This information is  used for system administration and for producing usage statistics.<br>
<br>
We do collect email addresses from individuals that wish to take advantage of  special promotional offers, but<strong><em> we do not sell, rent or disclose  collected email addresses to third parties.</em></strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Electronic Newsletters and Site Notification</strong><strong><br>
<br>
</strong>As  a service, we offer free, electronic newsletters and new site (or site  update) notifications to our users. ChooseWhat.com gathers the email  addresses from users who voluntarily subscribe for these services.  eMail addresses collected are used for newsletter and site notification  purposes only.<br>
<br>
Consumers may remove themselves from any  mailing list by following the instructions contained at the end of  every newsletter or website notification email.<br>
<br>
<strong>Cookies</strong><strong><br>
<br>
</strong>As  you browse ChooseWhat.com, we place "cookies" on your hard drive to show  which source (search engine and keywords, newsletter or site  notification, pay-per-click ad and so on) you used to find our site. We  also use cookies when you press the sign up button to collect aggregate  data for analysis. We do not use cookies to track single-user data.<br>
<br>
<strong>Unsubscribe Policy</strong><strong><br>
<br>
</strong>Users  may unsubscribe from any of our electronic newsletters or site  notifications at any time by following the instructions contained at  the end of each newsletter or notification.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of  Collected Information</strong><br>
<br>
Collecting the information described above enables us to tailor our content to  our readers' needs.<br>
<br>
All personally identifiable information provided to ChooseWhat.com is  maintained by and accessible only to ChooseWhat.com, unless stated  otherwise in this privacy policy.<br>
<br>
<strong>Third Party Partners</strong><strong><br>
<br>
</strong>ChooseWhat.com  has teamed up with reputable third party vendors in order to provide  certain services to its online users. When leaving our website to view  one of our partner websites, we encourage users to review the privacy  statements of those websites as we cannot guarantee the privacy of  users while visiting affiliate sites.<br>
<br>
<strong>Policy Changes</strong><strong><br>
<br>
</strong>Occasional changes may be made to our <em>privacy policy</em>. Visitors to ChooseWhat.com  are encouraged to check this document periodically to stay informed of current  privacy guidelines.<br>
<br>
<strong>Acceptance of Terms</strong><strong><br>
<br>
</strong>By using the ChooseWhat.com website, you signify your acceptance of this  website <em>privacy policy</em>.&nbsp;  If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our site.&nbsp;Your  continued use of the ChooseWhat.com site following the posting of changes  to these terms will indicate your acceptance of those changes.</p>
	<h2>How We Make Money</h2>
	<p>ChooseWhat.com is a for-profit business, but rather than charging a subscription fee, we have referral agreements with many of the companies we review. In an effort to provide a complete comparison resource we review all of the relevant companies we are aware of within a products category, regardless of whether they offer a referral program, because we need our visitors to be able to see an apples to apples comparison of all the providers. If we were to omit a products or service provider we would be forcing you to leave our site to obtain complete information. We also don't let the terms of our compensation agreements impact our reviews, for three primary reasons:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>We typically only get paid if you actually sign up for the service. Zero signups times a higher per signup amount is still zero dollars.</li>
		<li>For most referral programs, you must not cancel the service or return the product before the expiration of an initial period (typically 30 to 45 days). If we were to misrepresent a product or service, you would likely cancel or request a refund, and we'd make nothing anyway.</li>
		<li>We want to earn your loyalty, so you'll continue to come to us for advice. If you think we've misled you, you'll likely never use our site again- which would be the worst possible outcome. </li>
	</ol>
