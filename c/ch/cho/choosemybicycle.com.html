			<p><b>5. Our disclosure of your information</b><br>
			We may also use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your interests, such as new services and promotions. The following are examples of some categories of persons to whom we would share your information with from time-to-time.<br>
				5.a. Advertisements<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Where a user enters information on any form of an advertiser, the information is simultaneously collected by ChooseMyBicycle.com and the advertiser. The information is used by ChooseMyBicycle.com in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and is used by the advertiser as per the advertisers prevalent privacy policies. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these advertisers, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to provide the said information.<br><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. ChooseMyBicycle.com may also aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for other marketing and promotional purposes.<br><br>
				5.b. Classifieds Listings<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. When a user lists a classifieds advertisement, and the advertisement receives an expression of interest by the interested user, the interested user will be provided the contact information of the user listing the advertisement as provided in that user's registration form.<br><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. When a user expresses an interest in a classifieds advertisement, the user who has listed the advertisement will be provided the contact information of the interested user as provided in the interested user's registration form.<br><br>
				5.c. Bicycles and Services offered on the Site are by third parties<br>
				There are certain bicycles and services for which third parties request for information before the service is listed on the Site (example: application for bicycle loan/insurance). The information provided by the user for such purposes is simultaneously collected by ChooseMyBicycle.com and the respective third party. This information is utilized by the third party in accordance with its privacy policy and the terms of the offer. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their services.<br><br>
				5.d. Internal Service Providers<br>
				We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and service operations that we provide to you on the Site (e.g., search technology, discussion boards, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs) and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers. These internal service providers' are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced Site related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. In some instances, the internal service provider may collect information directly from you (such as for Site surveys). In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your personal information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.<br><br>
				5.e. Other Corporate Entities<br>
				We share much of our data, including personal information about you, with our parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, and joint ventures that are committed to serving your online trading needs and related services, throughout the world. To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other users. Our parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, and joint ventures follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable law. ChooseMyBicycle.com, its parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, its joint ventures, or any combination of such, will share some or all of your personal information with another business entity should we plan to, merge with, or be acquired by that business entity. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information.</p><br>
