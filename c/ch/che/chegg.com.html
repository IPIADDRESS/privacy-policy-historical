	<p><strong>WE
FULLY DESCRIBE OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES BELOW IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. THIS
SUMMARY PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING

 OUR USE AND SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION, AND THIRD PARTIES WHO MAY SERVE ADVERTISEMENTS AND WHO MAY SET <a href="#cookies">COOKIES</a> OR <a href="#web-beacons">WEB BEACONS</a> OR SIMILAR TRACKING

TECHNOLOGIES WHEN YOU USE THE SERVICES, BUT PLEASE REVIEW OUR FULL
PRIVACY POLICY BEFORE USING OUR SERVICES.</strong></p>

	<p>We
primarily use the information we collect when you use the Services in
connection with your relationship with Chegg, your use of the Services,
and for
	sending you information from us or on behalf of certain
third parties. This includes linking you to other members of the Chegg
community and, in some cases, may allow you to engage in real-time
video- or text-based chat with another community member. It also
includes providing offers to you based on information you provide or we
collect, or your use of the Services. Please review the <a href="#info">"INFORMATION COLLECTION"</a>
	and <a href="#use">"HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION"</a> sections of this
Privacy Policy for a full description of the information we collect,
including
	Personal Information (as defined below), and how we use that information.
Remember that if you create a Profile (as defined below) or participate in community forums
and similar features on the
	Services, your information may be
public. Note that we do not share your Personal Information with third
parties for their marketing purposes without your
	consent; however,
we may share your Personal Information under certain limited
circumstances. For more details, please review the section below
entitled
	<a href="#sharing">"Information Sharing."</a></p>

   <p>Chegg works with network advertisers, analytics service providers
and other vendors to serve third party advertisements on and through
the
	Services, to provide us with information regarding traffic on
the Services, including the pages viewed and the actions users take when
visiting the
	Services; to serve our advertisements on other web
sites, within mobile Apps, and elsewhere online; and to provide us with
information regarding the use of
	the Services and the effectiveness
of our advertisements. For example, if you click on a Chegg
advertisement, our service provider(s) may be able to tell
	us the
advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the
advertisement. You may also see third party ads on the Services. The
advertisements you
	see may be served by one or more third parties,
who may use information about your activities on the Services, and other
web sites and services, to provide
	you targeted advertising based
upon your interests. Our ad network providers, the advertisers, ad
agencies, analytics service providers and other
	vendors may set and
access their own tracking devices (including <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> and <a href="#web-beacons">web beacons</a>)
and they may otherwise collect or
	have access to information about
you and your visits to and activity on the Services, as well as on other
web sites or online services. Some of these parties may collect Personal
Information when you visit the Services or other websites and services.
Please review <strong>"THIRD PARTY AD NETWORKS AND ANALYTICS PROVIDERS"</strong> for additional information. Some of the companies who serve these targeted ads participate in a self-regulatory program that allows you to opt-out of having information about you used for this purpose, and you may access that opt-out by clicking <a href="mailto:legal1@chegg.com">here</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads while using the Services and elsewhere online.</p>

	<p><a id="info" name="info">INFORMATION COLLECTION</a></p>

	<p>1. Registration and Other Information You Provide</p>

	<p>The
Services may collect "<strong>Personal Information</strong>" (which is
information that can be used to identify or contact a specific
individual,
	such as your name and email address), account
information (such as a password or other information that helps us
confirm that it is you accessing your
	account) and demographic or
other information (such as your school, gender, age or birthdate and zip
code and information about your interests and
	preferences). We will
also collect payment information (typically, credit card account
information) if you choose to purchase products or services through

the Services. Some Services may allow you to use the Service to offer
your own products or services for sale (e.g., registering as a tutor on
our InstaEDU Service or maintaining an account for your restaurant on
our Campus Special Service). If you use the Services for such purposes
or in any other manner that may necessitate payment from Chegg to you,
we may collect additional information from you, such as your Social
Security Number or taxpayer identification number, as necessary to
facilitate payment and to comply with related legal obligations.  Any
information combined with Personal Information will be treated as
Personal Information.</p>

	<p>2. Your Profile, Community
Forums and User Content</p>

	<p>You may have the opportunity
to create a profile, which consists of information about you, which may
include Personal Information, photographs,
	information about your
academic and work history, your interests and activities, your use of
the Services and other information ("Profile"). Some of the

information in your Profile may be visible to third parties or to
everyone, depending on the nature of the information and the privacy
settings you choose
	when you sign in and go to your Account on the
website or other Services where you created your Profile. Chegg may also
make the information contained in
	your Profile accessible through
means other than the Chegg website (such as through an app or an
application programming interface (API)). Your Profile may
	also be
indexed by and displayed by internet search providers when someone
searches for your name. Chegg does not control how frequently
third-party search
	engines update their indexes; consequently their
information may be outdated and still available for a period of time
even if you discontinue use of the
	Service.</p>


<p><strong>Note that in order to provide services and opportunities to
you, educational organizations, scholarship providers and other third
parties may be
	able to review certain information in your Profile
for some of the Services, whether or not you have limited public access
to that information. You may have the opportunity to
	control
whether this information is shared, but some information may be shared
automatically -- all as disclosed on the website or other service where
you
	created your Profile. Chegg does not share your contact
information (email, full postal address or phone number) with those
third parties unless you
	request or agree to that sharing. However,
Chegg may send you information and offers from third parties and
information about the Services, and you may not
	be able to opt-out
from these messages without closing your account.</strong></p>


<p>The Services may provide you the opportunity to participate and post
content publicly in forums, through interactive features and through
other
	communication functionality ("Community Forums"). You may
choose, through such features or otherwise, to submit or post reviews,
problems, suggestions,
	ideas, solutions, questions, answers, class
notes, course outlines, comments, testimonials, feedback, messages,
images, videos, text or other material
	("User
Content"). Your User Content may also be posted in your
Profile.  In addition, if you choose to submit User Content for review
or instruction by another user as part of a tutoring lesson, your User
Content may be publicly posted to the Profile of your tutor as part of
the tutor's portfolio of work, including any Personal Information
you included in the applicable User Content. Please think carefully
about what you post and before including Personal Information in your
User Content. You may edit or remove your Profile information, but you
may not be able to remove answers or postings or other uploaded User
Content on some Services.
To request removal of content you posted publicly on the Services, contact us via email by clicking <a href="mailto:legal1@chegg.com">here</a>.
We will honor removal requests received from registered users who are minor
residents of California, unless otherwise excepted by law, and where
otherwise required by law. Other removal requests received, may, in our
sole discretion, be honored or refused.  In some cases, we may remove
only your Personal Information but maintain the rest of your User
Content.  Note that removal of public postings does not ensure complete
or comprehensive removal of the content or information posted. </p>


   <p><strong><em>Note that anything you post to a Community Forum may
be public</em>. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal
Information in your
	Profile or a Community Forum, that information
will be considered public information and the protections of this
Privacy Policy will not
	apply.</strong></p>

		<p>In
addition, the Services may allow members to communicate and collaborate
with each other, including some Services that allow members to engage in
one-on-one communication using a video chat or text chat feature. If you
create an account, participate in a Community Forum or choose to
communicate with others through the Services, certain information about
you may be disclosed in connection with your or others' use of
the Services, including certain information about you and your network
(such as your name and profile photo, the number of your connections,
and the names and pictures of your connections). Our servers may record
and we may retain records of the content of any such user-to-user
communications. <br>

We allow other users to use contact
information they have about you, such as your email address, to find
you, including
	through contact importers and search, and they may
also contact you through the Services.</p>

	<p>3. Third Party
Services, Social Media Platforms, and Information Third Parties Provide
About You</p>

	<p>Third parties may provide us with
information about you. For example, if you are on a third party web
site, and you opt-in to receive information from
	us, that third
party will forward information about you to us so that we may contact
you as requested.</p>

	<p>The Services may permit
interactions between the Services and a third party web site or service,
such as enabling you to "like" a product within our
	Services or
"share" content to other web sites. If you choose to "like" or
"share" content or to otherwise post information from or via the
Services to a
	third party web site, feature or application, that
information may be publicly displayed, and the third party web site may
have access to information about
	you and your use of our Services.
Similarly, if you post information on a third party platform that
references Chegg or one of the Services, your post may
	be published
on our Services in accordance with terms of that third party. These
features may collect your IP address or other Device Identifier, which
page you are visiting on our web site, and may set a cookie to enable
the third party feature to function properly. Third party features and
applications are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on
our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the
privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>

	<p>You may
also choose to participate in a third party application or feature
through our Services (such as logging in through Facebook Connect or
otherwise linking the Services with another web site or interactive
service) or on a third party web site or service (such as one of our
Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third
party web site or service) through which you allow us to collect (or the
third party to share) information about you, including Personal
Information. Information about you, including your name and profile
photo, may be shown to other users of the Services if you are logged in
through the Services or through a third party web site or service. The
third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which
case we will no longer collect information about you through the
application or feature, but we may retain the information previously
collected. When you choose to participate, you may be opting to link
your activity on our Services with that third party web site or service,
which may then collect information about your visits to our Services and
may publish that activity as you request to your profile or similar
feature with that third party (such as if you choose to share a purchase
you made on Chegg.com with your connections on the third party website).
In some instances, we may require that you participate in the Services
through a third party application or feature and, if you choose not to
authorize or use the required third party application or feature, you
will not be able to use the applicable Service.</p>

	<p>The
information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The
information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to
the third
	party's privacy practices, including whether the third
party continues to share information with us, the types of information
shared, and your choices with
	regard to what is visible to others
on that third party web site and service. The third party may allow you
to remove the application or feature, in which
	case we will no
longer collect information about you through the application or feature,
but we may retain the information previously collected.</p>


<p>We also may supplement the information we collect with outside
records from third parties in order to provide you with information,
services or goods
	you have requested, to enhance our ability to
serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities
to purchase products or services that
	we believe may be of interest
to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other
sources with information we collect through the Services.
	In those
cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined
information.</p>

	<p>4. Referral Features and Gift
Certificates</p>

	<p>The Services may offer referral features
whereby users may use an email tool to invite friends to use the
Services using a one-time email. Chegg stores
	this information for
the purpose of verification, as well as tracking the success of our
referral program. Chegg will not use those referred email
	addresses
for any other purpose (unless, of course, the referred user comes to a
Service and registers as a user, in which case Chegg may use the email

address provided by the referred user in accordance with this Privacy
Policy). The referred person may contact us via email by clicking <a href="mailto:legal1@chegg.com">here</a> to request
that we remove this information from our active database.</p>


<p>If you purchase a gift certificate for another person, we will ask
you for that person's name and email address, as well as for an
optional personal message. We will automatically send your friend a
one-time email including an invitation to visit the Services as well as
their gift code. Chegg stores information such as the gift certificate
recipient's name and email address for the sole purpose of
verification. Chegg does not sell or disclose any of this information to
any outside sources or parties and collects this information only to
maintain records that a gift certificate was purchased and sent to a
recipient. Coupons and vouchers are not gift certificates and must be
used according to the terms of the voucher or coupon itself or the
accompanying materials.</p>

	<p>5. Information Chegg Collects Automatically When You Access The Services</p>

	<p>Like other web sites and online services, we and our analytics providers and other third party service providers may automatically collect certain "Usage Information" whenever you access and use the Services, including, without limitation, by viewing information about a course or school, renting a textbook, ordering food, asking or answering questions, viewing another user's Profile, sending a message, searching for a person or information, or by clicking on an advertisement.</p>

	<p>Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to our Services (if applicable), the search terms you entered into a search engine that lead you to our Services (if applicable), all of the areas within our Services that you visit (including information about any ads you may view), and the time of day you used the Services, among other information. We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to tell you about people or events nearby, to provide special offers, to serve advertisements, to select appropriate content to display to you, and to enhance or otherwise improve the Services and our products.</p>

	<p>In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for any computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a "Device") you may use to access the Services. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access a Service, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access a Service. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.</p>
	<p>Usage Information is collected via tracking technologies, including:</p>


	<p><a id="cookies" name="cookies">Cookies and Log Files:</a> Chegg uses cookies and web log files to track usage of our Services. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer, and which allows Chegg to recognize you as a user when you return using the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our Services as fully as intended. Log files are the record of your visits to the Services and include Usage Information. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience when you use the Services. Third parties may also set cookies as you interact with the Service. Third parties may use session IDs and cookies to make it easier for you to use our Services and place orders, to deliver online advertising, and for other purposes, The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy, as we do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>

	<p>One type of cookie we use, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you've logged in to your account on the Services. If you do not log out of your account, then the next time you visit, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to log in before using the Services. Of course, if you are using a public computer or sharing your private computer with others, you should log out of your account after each visit. If you log out of a Service, you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. We also use a cookie which functions as a "session" cookie, meaning that it is used to identify a particular visit. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.</p>

	<p><a id="web-beacons" name="web-beacons">Web Beacons:</a> We, as well as our affiliate program partners, service providers, and other third parties, may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs), that help us better manage content on our Services by informing us of what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users for our affiliate program. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. This information is used to help improve the overall quality and experience of our Services. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' Personal Information.</p>

	<p><a id="embedded-script" name="embedded-script">An Embedded Script:</a> is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device from our server or a third party service provider and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Services.</p>
	<p>In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.</p>

	<p><a id="log-files" name="log-files">Flash &amp; HTML5:</a> We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content, information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 &amp; Flash to collect and store information.</p>

	<p>Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please click here:<br> <a data-in-app="true" class="not-strong" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html</a></p>

<p><a id="not-track-signals" name="use">How We Respond To Do Not Track Signals:</a></p>

<p>
	Please note that your
browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track"
signal to websites and online service you visit.  There is no consensus
among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this
context.  Like many websites and online services, Chegg does not alter
its practices when it receives a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's
browser.  To find out more about "Do Not Track", please visit
http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
</p>

	<p><a id="use" name="use">HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</a></p>


 <p>We use information about you, including Personal Information, the
information you provide in your Profile, User Content, and Usage
Information to: (1)
	allow you to participate in features we offer
or to provide related customer service, including, without limitation,
to respond to your questions, complaints or
comments; (2) tailor content, recommendations and offers we display to
you, both on the Services and elsewhere online; (3) process a

display social advertisements, whereby your name and profile photo may
be used to advertise products and services
	to your network based on
your use of the Services and your interactions with Chegg and third
parties through the Services (a "Social Ad"). If we are utilizing
Social Ads
	on one of our Services, you will be able to opt-out
through your account settings for that Service.</p>

 <p>Please
note that information submitted on the Services via a "Contact Us" or
other similar function may not receive a response. We will not use the

   information provided via these functions to contact you for marketing
purposes unrelated to your request unless you agree otherwise.</p>


	<p><a id="sharing" name="sharing">INFORMATION
SHARING</a></p>

 <p>Chegg does not share your Personal
Information with third parties for their marketing purposes without your
consent. Chegg may share non-Personal
	Information, such as
aggregate user statistics, demographic information and Usage Information
with third parties, including advertisers, content providers,
	and
analytics providers; and third parties may collect non-Personal
Information when you visit the Services. We also may share your Personal
Information
	with third parties with your consent, as disclosed at
the time you provide us with information, and as described below or
otherwise in this Privacy
 Policy:</p>

	<p>1.
<strong>Educational Institutions:</strong> We work with colleges,
universities, scholarship providers and educational institutions
("Educational
 Institutions") to provide targeted recruiting and
outreach to some of our members. For some of our Services, we may allow
Educational Institutions to review information in your
	Profile
(such as hometown, grade point average, and graduation year), whether or
not you have chosen to restrict public access to some of that
information.
 We do not share your contact information (email address,
full postal address or phone number) with these Educational Institutions
without your
	consent, but we may send you information on their
behalf. This is a fundamental element of some of our free Services. In
addition, you may indicate that you would
	like to receive
additional information from Educational Institutions or other third

their rights; upon request of an academic institution connected to an
investigation into academic integrity; to protect and/or defend any
applicable Terms of Use or other policies applicable to the Services; or

with copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service
providers or law enforcement agencies in our discretion. These
disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.</p>

	<p>5. <strong>Business Transitions.</strong> Chegg may share Personal
Information with its parent, subsidiaries and affiliates, primarily for
business and
	operational purposes. In the event that Chegg goes

company, or sale of all or a
	portion of its assets, bankruptcy, or other
corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of
any due diligence process, your information,
	including Personal
Information, will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be
notified via email and/or a prominent notice on Services of any
 change

choices you may have regarding your Personal Information. This Privacy
Policy will
	become binding upon the new owner of the information
until amended.</p>

	<p>6. <strong>Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions.</strong> We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other
promotions ("Promotion") that may require
	registration. By
participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to governing terms,
conditions or official rules, which may contain specific requirements

connection with winner selection, prize
	fulfillment, and as

Rights</a></p>

	<p>Pursuant to California Civil Code
Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to
request from companies conducting business in
	California a list of
all third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories
of personal information during the preceding year for the
	third
parties' direct marketing purposes and the categories of personal
information the company shares. Alternatively, the law provides that a
company that
	has a privacy policy that provides consumers choice
(opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third
parties for those third parties'
	direct marketing purposes may
instead provide information on how to exercise that choice. Chegg
qualifies for the alternative option; it has a
	comprehensive
privacy policy that sets forth that Chegg provides you choice prior to
sharing your personal information with third parties for their direct

marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at
the time Chegg offers that choice, Chegg does not share your
information
	with that identified third party for its direct
marketing purposes.</p>

	<p>If you are a California resident
and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing
information with third parties for their direct
	marketing purposes
and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request via email by clicking <a data-in-app="true" href="mailto:legal1@chegg.com">here</a> or write to
