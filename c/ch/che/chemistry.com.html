                cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you
                to navigate our website. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended

            <p>
                Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about
                your online activity on our site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you
                click, and the searches you conduct on our site. When you sign in to your account
                on our website, we will record your user or member ID and the name associated with
                your user or member ID in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your
                password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password
                saved for automatic sign-in. For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames,
                passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies.
                In the case of sites and services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie
                will contain a unique identifier. We may allow our authorized service providers
                to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities,

                We may allow third-parties, including IAC companies, advertising companies, and
                ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking
                technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact
                with their advertisements. Our website does not provide any personal information
                to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others
                who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver,
                and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised
                websites. They also may combine this information with personal information they
                collect from you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party's
                privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements
                and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may
                be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative,

            <p>
                Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics
                with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track
                the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are
                stored on the user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on
                the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this
                sentence.</p>
            <p>
                Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who
                have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may include
                web beacons in promotional (or other) e-mail messages or newsletters to determine
                whether messages have been opened and acted upon. We also may receive an anonymous
                identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed
                on a third-party website.</p>
