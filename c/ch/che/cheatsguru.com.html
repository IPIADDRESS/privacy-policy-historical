<p>
</p><h2><i>Effective as of October 2, 2018</i></h2><br><br>
<p>We at CheatsGuru.com (the "Site") respect the privacy concerns of the users of this Site and have created this privacy policy to explain:</p>
<br>
<p>(1) what information we gather from you when you visit our Site,</p>
<p>(2) how we may use such information,</p>
<p>(3) your choices concerning how we may use such information,</p>
<p>(4) the security measures we take to protect such information, and</p>
<p>(5) how you can contact us regarding privacy-related questions.</p><br>
<p>Some information is collected on this Site automatically through our technology; other information is collected only when you choose to give it to us.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>
</p><h2>Notice to EU Residents</h2><br><br>
<p>This Policy is intended to provide adequate and consistent safeguards for the handling of personal information in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ("the Directive") and all the relevant transposing legislation of the Directive in the European Union/European Economic Area, the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act, as such laws may from time to time be amended and valid during the application of this Policy, the Privacy Shield, and any other privacy laws, regulations and principles concerning the collection, storage, use, transfer and other processing of personal data transferred from the European Economic Area or Switzerland to the United States including but not limited to the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC ("the General Data Protection Regulation") as of its entry into force on 25 May 2018.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>
</p><h2>Information We Gather Automatically</h2><br><br>
<p>When you visit this Site, certain non-personally identifying information is recorded automatically by the standard operation of our Internet servers. Information such as the type of browser being used, its operating system, and your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number that your Internet service provider assigns to your computer whenever you surf the Internet) in order to facilitate our online operations and to assure an efficient online experience for you. We may use or share this information for security purposes, to generate group statistics about our user community, or as required by law.</p>
<br><p>Among the purposes for which we may use such generally non-personally identifying information is for identification purposes in the event of an emergency threatening life or property, or where proper legal process allows using such information. For instance, we may use your IP address or other automatically recorded information, in cooperation with your Internet provider, to attempt to identify you if it is necessary to contact you or to bring legal action against you because you are violating the Terms of Service for use of this Site, may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with our company's rights or property, or may be adversely affecting other users of this Site or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities.</p>
<br><p>The Site utilizes "cookies". A "cookie" is a small text file that an Internet site can place on your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make using this Site easier by, among other things, saving your preferences for you and to help identify you whenever you return to our Site. Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. However, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent (note: you may need to consult your browser's "Help" area for instructions on how to do that).</p>
<br><p>Some of our Site�s pages may also contain electronic images called "Clear GIFs", "Single-Pixel GIFs", or "Web Beacons". Clear GIFs primarily compile aggregated, anonymous statistics about our Site. For example, Clear GIFs allow us to count page views and to access cookies. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a Clear GIF. Typically, though, Clear GIFs are very small (1-by-1 pixel size) files. They are often invisible on a web page, but their presence can be detected within many Internet browsers by setting your browser to view web page "sources". Clear GIFs are so small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen that is better used to display helpful content. We may also include Clear GIFs in our email correspondence in order to determine information about the opening and reading of such emails. In addition, some advertising networks that serve ads on our Site may occasionally use Clear GIFs within banner advertisements.</p>
<p>Clear GIFs set by us on the Site and in our email correspondence generally are not used to collect, gather, monitor, or share Personal Information about our users, though they can be used in conjunction with cookies to record particular actions. We use Clear GIFs primarily to compile aggregated, anonymous statistics about the Site and our email correspondence.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>
</p><h2>Personal Information You Provide to Us</h2><br><br>
<p>We may request personally identifying information from you in a variety of contexts. For example, you may provide such data to us if you: (1) complete an online registration form (e.g., registering for an account, various sign-up forms for receiving email newsletters, registering for special offers, entering a contest/sweepstakes or responding to a survey); (2) fill out an information request form; or (3) register to participate in message boards and chat rooms and other community features.</p>
<br><p>In such cases, the personally identifying information we request may include your name, gender, a photo of yourself, email address, mailing address and zip code, and phone number (collectively, "Personal Information"). In addition, we may collect other non-personally identifying information such as your country of residence, language preference, hobbies, and other information regarding your interaction with our Site such as your viewing habits and cheats submissions, preferences ,and other customized activities in which you participate. Of course, you never have to answer any of the questions we ask you (nor choose to view or upload any content or otherwise interact with our Site), but refusal to do so may limit the services we can provide to you.</p>
<p>When you provide Personal Information to us, we may use that data to create a <b>"My Profile"</b> page for you, which will be held in a database using reasonable security measures to protect the data from unauthorized access. Others outside CheatsGuru.com will not be allowed to see the data on your <b>My Profile Page</b> except with your consent (see <a href="#contact">"How to Contact Us"</a> below). If you register to set up an account, you will be able to access your <b>My Profile</b> page at any time in order to update your individual Personal Information listed therein (see below under <a href="#correct">"How Can You Correct, Review, or Request Deletion of Your Personal Information?"</a> for more details).</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>
</p><h2>How Can Your Personal Information Be Used?</h2><br><br>
<p>Within CheatsGuru.com</p>
<br><p>We may use the Personal Information you provide us and other non-personally identifying information we collect to update you about our products or services or to contact you about exciting offers of new products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. You always have the option to receive fewer or no communications in the future from us by opting-out. You may opt out by following the instructions included in the specific communication you no longer wish to receive or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@cheatsguru.com">privacy@cheatsguru.com</a> and explaining how you would like to modify your preferences (see below under <a href="#correct">"How Can You Correct, Review, or Request Deletion of Your Personal Information?"</a> for more details).</p>
<br><p>With Other CheatsGuru.com-Related Companies</p>
<br><p>When you give Personal Information to CheatsGuru.com, where lawfully permissible, we may share that data (together with non-personally identifying information you may provide) with other CheatsGuru.com-related companies. As a result of this sharing, you may receive communications from other CheatsGuru.com-related companies that include offers of products or services tailored to your interests. These communications might include, for example, emails or mailed literature about new products or services, promotions, discounts, sales, openings of new facilities or websites or other similar information. You have the option to receive fewer or no communications in the future from other CheatsGuru.com-related companies that we may provide your information to by following the instructions included in the specific communication you no longer wish to receive, or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@cheatsguru.com">privacy@cheatsguru.com</a> and explaining how you would like to modify your preferences (see below under "How Can You Correct, Review, or Request Deletion of Your Personal Information?" for more details).</p>
<br><p>Finally, without any specific approval from you, we may develop general aggregate data (i.e., data that cannot be used to identify specific individuals) about our user community that is partly based on information about you and your transactions with CheatsGuru.com.
