Introduction

  Chessclub.com handles a variety of different forms of information from
  its members and guests.  Some of this information is entered manually
  by the users of Chessclub.com while they are logged in, or during the
  registration process.  Some of this information is collected
  automatically by our software without the explicit knowledge of the
  user.  This document describes what information we do and do not
  collect, who has access to the information that is collected, how to
  change or delete this information, and a number of related issues.

  We try to ensure that the flow of information is strictly limited in
  accordance with the policies below.  But remember that there are
  unusual circumstances under which they might be violated, and
  information might be revealed to people in violation of these
  policies.  Some examples include: a subpoena, a break-in to
  Chessclub.com's computers (either physical or electronic), or an
  employee or Administrator who breaks the rules.

  In the rest of this document the term "Admin" refers to the set of
  Chessclub.com administrators, the list of which can be seen by typing
  "<a href="/help/admins">help admins</a>".

Registration Information

  The following information (which you may have specified when you
  registered) can be seen only by Admins: Your name, your email address,
  your password, your postal address, your phone number, your previous
  Chessclub.com handle, your USCF ID, expiration, and PIN number.
  Of course you are free to publicize your personal information.

  Chessclub.com may use your email address to sporadically send you
  important announcements.  (In the past such announcements have been
  sent fewer than once per year.  For example, such a bulk mailing was
  once used to tell all of our members an alternative way to connect to
  our server when the server machine was under attack.)  If you do not
  wish to ever get such announcements, send email to news@chessclub.com
  stating this fact.

  Chessclub.com may use your postal address (if you checked the box to
  allow its use) to mail you information about products and services
  available from 3rd parties.  Chessclub.com will not give your address
  to these 3rd parties.

  Naturally your Handle, your rating and title (after verification) 
  are all publically visible.  Your country is also public information. 

  If you want to know the identity, email address, or other information
  on a Chessclub.com member, please do not ask an Admin.  Ask the member
  directly.  It is his or her decision to tell you.

Credit Card Information

  Credit card numbers are only stored on Chessclub.com servers in
  encrypted form.  They are not visible to anybody except Chessclub.com
  employees (a small subset of the Admins) involved in the processing of
  payments.  Credit cards are processed by Cybercash.  Cybercash sends
  credit card numbers over the Internet in encrypted form.  (For more
  information see <a href="http://www.cybercash.com">http://www.cybercash.com</a> .)  The name, address, and
  phone number that is entered when a credit card is used is visible to
  the Admins.  The card number is not.

Private Communication

  Chessclub.com does not explicitly log tell-type (that is, "tell" and
  "say") communication between a pair of users.  Any such conversation
  you have with another member is totally private.  Nobody, including
  Admins, can listen in on any such conversation that takes place on a
  Chessclub.com server.  However, there is a debugging log that on rare
  instances contains such a tell message, and it is possible that an
  Admin could inadvertently see such a message.  Such occurrences are
  rare, and are not under the control of the Admins.

  Admins are sometimes privy to conversations between a pair of
  Chessclub.com members.  This happens when one of the members of that
  conversation relays the conversation to the Admin.

Public Communication

  Many modes of communication on a Chessclub.com server give the user an
  opportunity to reveal personal information to many other people.  This
  includes shouts, channels, and kibitzes.  Please remember that any
  information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public
  information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose
  your personal information.

Implicitly Collected Information

  For each session on a Chessclub.com server, an entry is made in a
  permanent connection log.  The following information is recorded in
  that log:

     The time of the connection and disconnection
     The name of the interface that was used
     The IP number of the connection
     The Handle name
     The Machine ID of the computer from which the connection was made

  The Machine ID is a string which uniquely identifies the computer on
  which this connection was made.  This allows us to very reliably
  determine if two different sessions used the same computer.

  In addition, while you're playing on a Chessclub.com server, several
  other pieces of information are made available to the server.  The
  Chessclub.com client program notes when you switch from the client
  program to some other program and vice versa.  The Chessclub.com
  client and server are also able to determine whether or not you
  currently have a chess program running on your computer.  This
  information is used for the sole purpose of identifying people who are
  cheating by using a chess engine.  The Admins and a few other people
  who help catch computer cheaters are the only ones who have access to
  this information. (Read "<a href="/help/computers">help computers</a>" for more information on
  Chessclub.com's computer policies.)

  Chessclub.com's software does not monitor any activity nor access any
  data beyond what is listed above, or what is obviously needed for the
  functioning of the software.  For example, it does access the profiles
  and PGN files it needs, but it does not access your email file.

Security

  While you're connected to a Chessclub.com server using a "timestamped"
  client (such as Blitzin), all communication between you and the server
  is encrypted.  All Chessclub.com servers are located in secure
  co-location facilities.  Backups of user records are made on a regular
  basis.

Viewing Removing or Changing Your Personal Information

  You can see your personal information by issuing the "personal-info"
  command while on a Chessclub.com server.
  You can modify this information by using the "set" command.  (Read
  "<a href="/help/set">help set</a>" for more details.)  For example, "set telephone 412-521-5553",
  will set your telephone number.

  You can also contact the Chessclub.com business office to request that
  this information be changed or removed.  Here is the contact
  information:
