				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>
			  CheatServer respects the privacy rights of its visitors and is committed to protecting all personal information. To further this commitment, we have adopted this Online Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to guide how we collect, store, and use your online information. CheatServer follows established online information collection and use practices. 
				</p>
				
				<h3>What does this Privacy Policy apply to?</h3>
				<p>
			 This Privacy Policy currently applies to the following web site(s) operated by CheatServer (collectively referred to as the “CheatServer Web site,”&nbsp;“our Web site,” or “cheatserver.com”): 
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  <a href="http://www.cheatserver.com/">www.cheatserver.com</a>
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  In the future, if we wish to include additional Web sites under this Privacy Policy, we will take reasonable steps to list those Web sites above and ensure that they provide a link to this Privacy Policy.
			  <br>
			  <br>
			 Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through the CheatServer Web site (as listed above), whether maintained by CheatServer or one of our vendors, and does <em>not</em> apply to information that may be collected by CheatServer offline. In addition, this Privacy Policy does not extend to Web sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link or which link to us. Because we cannot guarantee that the privacy policies of such sites meet our high standards, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of the Web site to which you link before you submit any personal information to that site. 
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  <em>Please note that by using our Web site, you signify your assent to CheatServer’s
				 Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not
				 use our Web site. We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Please
				 check back from time to time to ensure that you are aware of these changes. Your
				 continued use of our Web site will signify your acceptance of these changes. Please
				 note that if we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you
				 by posting the change on our Web site or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary,
				 give you additional choices regarding such changes.</em>

			  <h3>What types of information does CheatServer collect and how is it used? </h3>
			  <p>
			  <a href="contact.asp?form_type=contact">Contact Us Form</a><br>
			  If you choose to contact us using this form, we may ask you to provide your first
			  name, e-mail address, and a description of your question or comment. This form is
			  intended for questions and comments only. We use the information you provide solely
			  to respond to your inquiry and for no other purpose. We may retain and aggregate
			  your comments for demographic purposes and to improve our service.
			  </p>
				
			<h3>Does CheatServer use cookies, or other passive means to collect information?</h3>
				<p>
			  Like many Web sites, CheatServer.com sets “cookies” on your computer.
			  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard
			  drive through your Web browser, allowing us to determine the time and date of a
			  cookie previously supplied by CheatServer, if applicable. If cookies are not enabled
			  on your Web browser, you will still be able to use the CheatServer Web site. The
			  “help” menu on most Web browsers will tell you how to enable cookies.
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser
			  may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.
				</p>
				<p>
			  We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer
			  our Web site. Your IP address is also used to collate traffic statistics for our
			  server.
			  </p>
			  
			  <h3>Who is collecting my personal information and is it shared with anyone?</h3>
			  <p>
			  The information that you disclose on the CheatServer Web site is collected by CheatServer
			  or by a vendor on CheatServer’s behalf; and, is used in accordance with the practices
			  set forth above. A breakdown of our data disclosure policies follows.
			  </p>
			  
			  <h4>Agents and Contractors</h4>
			  <p>
			  The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Web
			  advertising partner. Information about your visits to this site, such as number
			  of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information),
			  is used to serve ads to you. For more information about DoubleClick, cookies, and
			  how to “opt-out”, please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy/" target="_blank">click here</a>.
			  </p>
			  
			  <h4>Co-Sponsors and Promotional Partners</h4>
			  <p>
			  From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities
			  (“events”) on our Web site. Information collected for these events may
			  include personal information (e.g., name, mailing address, etc.) and may be collected
			  by or shared with a third party sponsor, co-sponsor, or other reputable third party
			  (e.g., promotional partner, retailer, or game or magazine publisher). While we have
			  no control over the third party's use of such information, we will attempt to ensure
			  that they agree to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of any personal
			  information we share with them (or that they collect through our Web site). If you
			  do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you
			  can choose not to participate in these events at the time of the contest/event or
			  when the information is collected.
			  </p>
			  
			  <p>
			  In some instances, we may have an arrangement with a promotional partner, whereby
			  they share with us customer information collected on their web site. In the event
			  that we receive such data and combine it with our customer records, the combined
			  information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, all
			  such information is subject to the privacy policy under which it was collected.
			  </p>
				
			  <h4>Disclosure and/or Transfer of Personal Information</h4>
			  <p>
			  We may disclose any and/or all personal information about you in the good faith
			  belief that we are required to do so by law, including but not limited to requests
			  pursuant to subpoena or court order, and/or disclosure to local, state, or federal
			  law enforcement, or other government officials pursuant to investigations they are
			  conducting. In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization,
			  bankruptcy, or other similar event, CheatServer’s user information may be
			  transferred to our successor or assign.
			  </p>
			  
			  <h4>Aggregate Information</h4>
			  <p>
			  We may provide our prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties with
			  aggregate data about visitors to the CheatServer Web site. However, such data is
			  anonymous, and we do not disclose personally identifying information about specific
			  users. 
			  </p>
			  
			  <h3>How do I ask a question or file a complaint?</h3>
			  <p>
			  If you have any questions, complaints, or comments regarding this Privacy Policy
			  or our information collection practices, please e-mail us at:
