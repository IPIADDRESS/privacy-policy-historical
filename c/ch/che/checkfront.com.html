We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information in our custody and control from unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure of personal information in our custody and control. For example, for security of transactions, we use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts any information, such as credit card number and billing information, you send to us electronically. The encryption process protects your information, by scrambling it before it is sent to us from your computer. Once Checkfront receives your transmission, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our system. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. More information about security is available on the Site and in our <a href="https://www.checkfront.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p><p><a id="_other"></a></p><h2>Other Information Collectors</h2><p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect.
