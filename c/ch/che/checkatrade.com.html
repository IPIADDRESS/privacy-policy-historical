    <p>
        When you use <b>Checkatrade</b> you may need to provide us with personal information
        about yourself or perhaps other people. When you provide such information, you consent
        to the use by us of such information in accordance with the following privacy policy.

    <h3>
        Your Information</h3>
    <p>
        Unless we specifically notify you otherwise or you have elected otherwise, any information
        you provide to <b>Checkatrade</b> will only be used within <b>Checkatrade</b> and
        for the delivery of <b>Checkatrade</b>’s services to you and/or your nominated acquaintances.
        <b>Checkatrade</b> will use the information for administration purposes and for
        the provision to you of any information and services that you have requested. We
        will only disclose your personal information without notice to you when we believe
        such disclosure to be required by law or regulation, or to be necessary to protect
        or defend the rights or property of <b>Checkatrade</b> or the safety of the public.
    </p>
    <p>
        Members of the public submitting feedback about Checkatrade members will not have

    </p>
    <p>
        We will only keep a record of your information for as long as is necessary for the
        purposes it was provided: for example, we will only hold your personal information
        on our systems for as long as you use the service that you have requested. We will
        ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely.

        browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.
