We are about to tell you some very important information, so please ask your mom or dad to come and read along with you. We are very concerned about protecting the privacy of children under 13. So, we think that it's important for you and your parents to understand and feel comfortable with how we collect information from you and how we use that information.</p><p>The Chevron Cars website is designed for kids of all ages to play games, have fun, and learn new things. We have packed our site with lots of different games, activities, and an online store called the KIDS SHOP. We hope that you'll look around the KIDS SHOP at all of the cool things, but you can't buy anything in the KIDS SHOP unless you are 18 years or older. If you are under 18 and you want to buy something, you'll have to ask your parents to buy it for you.</p><p>We are not allowed to require you to tell us more about yourself than is reasonably necessary to play games or participate in activities on our site. So, for most activities, we don't ask you for any identifying information. For some activities, we ask for your email address and your parent's email address. We only ask for your email address when you ask US to send YOU email, such as a newsletter or an answer to your question. And, we ask for your parent's email address so that we can tell your mom or dad that you have asked us to send you email. We don't share any information collected on this site with anybody. And, as you'll see, there are no advertisers on this site.</p>See this cute squirrel? <br></font><center><img src="/wocc/abt/pages/img/wally_new.gif" border="0" align="middle" alt="Wally The Warning Squirrel"></center><font class="copy"><br> That's Wally the Warning Squirrel. He will appear to warn you that either (1) you are being asked to give us personally identifying information, (2) you are entering an area of the site that contains commercial and/or product information, or (3) you are entering the KIDS SHOP where you must be 18 or older and have a valid credit card to make a purchase.<p></p><center><font class="header2"><b>Privacy Policy Table Of Contents:</b></font></center><p></p><ul><li><a href="#info" class="a">WHAT information we collect and WHY we collect it</a> </li><li><a href="#reviewing" class="a">Reviewing or changing your information</a> </li><li><a href="#links" class="a">Links to other sites</a> </li><li><a href="#contact" class="a">How to contact us</a></li></ul><p></p><center><a name="info"><font class="header2">WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WHY WE COLLECT IT:</font></a></center><font class="copy"><p>Here is the scoop on HOW and WHEN we ask for information, WHAT information we collect and WHY we collect it:</p>(1) <font color="#009900"><b>Information for Registration.</b></font> To save your personal game scores in the PLAYGROUND or to make a wish list in the KIDS SHOP we ask you to register. To register, we ask you for two pieces of information about you: your birthday and parent's email address. We also ask you for a Screen Name and Password that you get to choose. NONE of this information, by itself or in combination, is enough to tell us who you are or how to contact you, except through your parent's email address.<p><b><u>YOUR BIRTHDAY.</u></b> We use your birthday to see how many people in your age group are using the site, and we use that information to improve the site.</p><b><u>YOUR PARENT'S EMAIL.</u></b> If you are under 13, we ask you for your parent's email address. We use your parent's email address only as a means to notify your mom or dad that you have registered on our site.<p><b><u>A SCREEN NAME AND PASSWORD YOU CHOOSE.</u></b> The Screen Name and Password you choose should be a favorite hobby, a favorite animal, your favorite food, or any other neat word. To better protect your privacy, we specifically ask you NOT to use your real name for your Screen Name or your Password. You should be careful in maintaining the confidentiality and security of your User Name and Password. Notwithstanding our security measures, the nature of the Internet and each user's computer and/or other access device all permit the possibility that your data and a your computer and/or other access device are potentially accessible by third parties, such as computer hackers.</p>(2) <font color="#009900"><b>The Kids Shop.</b></font> Everyone is allowed to browse the KIDS SHOP and look at all the cool things for sale. BUT you MUST BE 18 OR OLDER and have a valid credit card to make a purchase. If you want to, you can make a "Wish List" of the cool things you like in the KIDS SHOP and send it in an email to your friends and family!! If you want to make and save a "Wish List" in the KIDS SHOP, you first will have to make sure that you have logged in with your Screen Name and Password. Once you are logged in, just click on the "Add to Wish List" button on any of the pages that feature a car or product and that item will be added to your "Wish List." You can view and edit your "Wish List" whenever you come back to the KIDS SHOP. To view it, simply make sure you are logged in and click on the Wish List icon at the top right hand of any page in the KIDS SHOP. Your Wish List will appear and you will be able to view and delete any of the items on your Wish List. If you want to, you can email your "Wish List" to friends and family. When you send your "Wish List", we don't save either your email address or your friend's email address. The "Wish List" is sent from YOUR email address, NOT from our website address.<p>(3) <font color="#009900"><b>Newsletters.</b></font> If you decide that you want to, you can ask to receive a subscription to one of our newsletters via email. Just click on the "Sign Up" button under the Newsletters/Subscribe section on the homepage, or elsewhere on the site. When you click on the Newsletter "Sign Up" button after having entered your email address, we ask you to tell us how old you are on the Registration Page. After you tell us your age, and if you are below 13, a new page appears and asks for your parent's email address. We keep your parent's email address so that your parent can review, change, delete or block your email address from our newsletter mailing list at any time. We keep your email address only so that we can send you newsletters and only for as long as you want us to keep sending them to you. If or when you decide that you don't want to receive a newsletter anymore, just reply to any newsletter, put "unsubscribe" in the subject line and we will stop sending it to you and delete your email address from our mailing list for that newsletter.</p><p>If you are under 13 years of age, and do not register on the Registration page, or if your birthdate as entered is not valid for any reason, we treat your email address as we would the email address of anyone under 13, and keep it completely separate from your profile or any personally identifiable information. Similarly, if you sign-up for a newsletter and are already logged in or registered as someone under 13, your email address is kept completely separate from your profile and any personally identifiable information.</p><p>We have two newsletters that you may subscribe to: THE TRIBUNE, and GENERAL TOY CAR NEWS. THE TRIBUNE is a weekly newsletter about fun things to do, interesting historical events, and little known facts. GENERAL TOY CAR NEWS is a note about new games and content on the website, and news about the toy cars. Remember, we won't send a newsletter to you automatically -- you have to tell us that you want to receive it.</p><p>(4) <font color="#009900"><b>My Cars.</b></font> If you have a collection of Chevron Cars at home, you can go to MY CARS and make a list of your collection online so that you can keep track of which cars you own. If you want to build and save your online collection, just make sure that you are logged in and click on the "MY CARS" icon that appears at the top of every page of the website. When you get into MY CARS, you can add all of the cars you own and save the list. Just click on the "Add to my Collection" button and click on the car that you would like to add. You can also officially register each of your cars. If you decide to officially register one of your cars you will be asked the following questions: </p><ul><li>How did you acquire the car? </li><li>Where did you purchase the car? </li><li>When did you get your car? </li><li>How did you learn about this car? </li><li>What is your first name (so that we can display it on the certificate)? </li><li>Did you receive this car as a gift? If so, what is the first name of the person who gave it to you (so that we can display it on the certificate)? </li><li>How many of this car do you have? </li><li>You can also add personal notes about your car. </li></ul>None of the information that you tell us in MY CARS, by itself or in combination, is enough to tell us who you are or how to contact you. When you've finished, you can print your online collection, you can print your official certificate, or you can email your online collection to your friends or family. When you email your online collection to your friends or family, we do not save either your email address or your friend's email address. Your collection is sent from YOUR email address, NOT from our website address.<p>(5) <font color="#009900"><b>Winning a Prize.</b></font> From time to time, we sponsor contests online in which you will have the chance to win a prize. If you win one of the contests, we will post a message in the section that you entered the contest like Answering Machine or Know-It-All. In order to know if you are a winner and to get this message, you must be logged on to the site under your User Name. Then, we will ask you to send us your parent's email address so that we can send an email to your parent to let your mom or dad know that you have won a prize on our website. We will also tell your mom or dad what he or she needs to do to help you claim your prize. We will only use personal information about you that we collect from your mom or dad for the purpose of sending you the prize and we will delete your personal information from our records immediately after sending you the prize.</p><p>(6) <font color="#009900"><b>Questions and Feedback.</b></font> As you look at our site, you might decide to use our feedback page to give us advice about what you think we are doing well, or what you think we can do to make this website even better. If you want to give us feedback, you may do so on the homepage or in the FREE STUFF section without telling us anything about yourself. But, if you ask a question and would like us to respond, you will need to give us your email address. We will use your email address ONLY to respond to the question or feedback that you sent to us, and then we will throw your email address away.</p>(7) <font color="#009900"><b>Cookies and Other Electronic Footprints.</b></font> Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies let us know if you come back to Chevron Cars, so that we can say, "Hello, again" and they help us keep track of your High Score on the games you play!!! You can set your browser to refuse cookies if you want to, but it might interfere with some of your activities on the site.<p>When you are surfing the different pages on our website, your electronic footprints allow our computer to identify your computer using its IP address. Using the IP address, our computer gathers certain information such as which pages you visited and how long you stayed. But NONE of this information gives us access to your name, where you live, your email or other personally identifiable information. We use this anonymous information to help us figure out what you like most about our site so that we can keep improving it for everyone to enjoy!!</p><a href="#top" class="minornav"><font color="#339900">Back to Top</font></a><p></p><center><font class="header2"><a name="reviewing">REVIEWING OR CHANGING YOUR INFORMATION</a></font></center><p></p><font class="copy"><b>GAMES AND ACTIVITIES:</b> If you want to view, change or delete the information that you gave us to save your scores in the PLAYGROUND or to make a "Wish List" in the KIDS SHOP, such as your Password or birthday you can do so by clicking on the "My Profile" icon that will appear in the top left corner of every page.

If you want to cancel your subscription to a Newsletter, you may also do so by replying to one of the newsletters and inserting "unsubscribe" in the subject line. If you cancel all subscriptions, we will delete your email address.

Because we respect your privacy, we want to disclose to you how we use the information that you provide to us online. Most of our site is intended for children's use, and in our Privacy Policy for Kids, we tell kids and their parents about our collection and use of information from children under 13.</p>The Chevron Cars website is designed for kids of all ages to play games, have fun, and learn new things. We have designed our site to include games, activities and an online store called the KIDS SHOP. The KIDS SHOP contains items we know are attractive to children and teenagers under 18, but we do not allow anyone under 18 years old to make a purchase in the store. Of course, we encourage people of all ages to look at our cool merchandise. However, we make it very clear to all users that you must be 18 or older to make a purchase in our KIDS SHOP. In fact, you can't make a purchase in the KIDS SHOP without a valid credit card. Anybody under 18 wanting to make a purchase must ask their parents to do it for them.<p></p><center><font class="header2"><b>Privacy Policy Table Of Contents:</b></font> <br></center><p></p><ul><li><a href="#info2" class="a">WHAT information we collect and How we use that information</a> </li><li><a href="#reviewing2" class="a">Reviewing or changing your information</a> </li><li><a href="#links2" class="a">Links to other sites</a> </li><li><a href="#contact2" class="a">How to contact us</a></li></ul><p></p><center><a name="info2"><font class="header2">WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE THAT INFORMATION:</font></a></center><font class="copy"><p>Following is a list of the kinds of information we collect on our site, and how we use that information.</p>(1) <font color="#009900"><b>Cookies and Other Electronic Footprints.</b></font> Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
