<h3>Privacy Policy for Kids Under 13 and Their Parents</h3>
<p><em>(Please see below for <a href="#top2">Privacy Policy for Everyone Over 13</a>)</em></p>
<p>
Welcome to the Chevron Cars website!! We are about
to tell you some very important information, so please ask your mom or
dad to come and read along with you. We are very concerned about
protecting the privacy of children under 13. So, we think that it's
important for you and your parents to understand and feel comfortable
with how we collect information from you and how we use that
information.
</p>
<p>
The Chevron Cars website is designed for kids of all
ages to play games, have fun, and learn new things. We have packed our
site with lots of different games, activities, and an online store
called the KIDS SHOP. We hope that you'll look around the KIDS SHOP at
all of the cool things, but you can't buy anything in the KIDS SHOP
unless you are 18 years or older. If you are under 18 and you want to
buy something, you'll have to ask your parents to buy it for you.
</p>
<p>
We are not allowed to require you to tell us more
about yourself than is reasonably necessary to play games or
participate in activities on our site. So, for most activities, we
don't ask you for any identifying information. For some activities, we
ask for your email address and your parent's email address. We only ask
for your email address when you ask US to send YOU email, such as a
newsletter or an answer to your question. We also ask for your email
when you send an electronic postcard or use the "email this page"
button to a friend, but we delete this email immediately after the
email is sent and do not store it. And, we ask for your parent's email
address so that we can tell your mom or dad that you have asked us to
send you email. We don't share any information collected on this site
with anybody. And, as you'll see, there are no advertisers on this
site.
</p>
<center>
<img src="/about/privacy/wally.gif" alt="Wally The Warning Squirrel" align="middle" border="0">
<br>See this cute squirrel? 
</center>
<p>
That's Wally the Warning Squirrel. He will appear to warn you that
either (1) you are being asked to give us personally identifying
information, (2) you are entering an area of the site that contains
commercial and/or product information, or (3) you are entering the KIDS
SHOP where you must be 18 or older and have a valid credit card to make
a purchase.

</ul>
<a name="info"><h5>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WHY WE COLLECT IT:</h5></a>
<p>
Here is the scoop on HOW and WHEN we ask for information, WHAT information we 
collect and WHY we collect it:
</p>
<p>
<b>(1)Information for Registration.</b>
To save your personal game scores in the PLAYGROUND or to make a wish
list in the KIDS SHOP we ask you to register. To register, we ask you
for two pieces of information about you: your birthday and parent's
email address. We also ask you for a Screen Name and Password that you
get to choose. NONE of this information, by itself or in combination,
is enough to tell us who you are or how to contact you, except through
your parent's email address.
</p>
<p>
<b><u>YOUR BIRTHDAY.</u></b> 
We use your birthday to see how many people in your age group are using
the site, and we use that information to improve the site.
</p>
<p>
<b><u>YOUR PARENT'S EMAIL.</u></b>
If you are under 13, we ask you for your parent's email address. We use
your parent's email address only as a means to notify your mom or dad
that you have registered on our site. </p><p>
</p>
<p>
<b><u>A SCREEN NAME AND PASSWORD YOU CHOOSE.</u></b>
The Screen Name and Password you choose should be a favorite hobby, a
favorite animal, your favorite food, or any other neat word. To better
protect your privacy, we specifically ask you NOT to use your real name
for your Screen Name or your Password. You should be careful in
maintaining the confidentiality and security of your User Name and
Password. Notwithstanding our security measures, the nature of the
Internet and each user's computer and/or other access device all permit
the possibility that your data and your computer and/or other access
device are potentially accessible by third parties, such as computer
hackers.
</p>
<p>
<b>(2) The Kids Shop.</b>
Everyone is allowed to browse the KIDS SHOP and look at all the cool
things for sale. BUT you MUST BE 18 OR OLDER and have a valid credit
card to make a purchase. If you want to, you can make a "Wish List" of
the cool things you like in the KIDS SHOP and send it in an email to
your friends and family!! If you want to make and save a "Wish List" in
the KIDS SHOP, you first will have to make sure that you have logged in
with your Screen Name and Password. Once you are logged in, just click
on the "Add to Wish List" button on any of the pages that feature a car
or product and that item will be added to your "Wish List." You can
view and edit your "Wish List" whenever you come back to the KIDS SHOP.
To view it, simply make sure you are logged in and click on the Wish
List icon at the top right hand of any page in the KIDS SHOP. Your Wish
List will appear and you will be able to view and delete any of the
items on your Wish List. If you want to, you can email your "Wish List"
to friends and family. When you send your "Wish List", we don't save
either your email address or your friend's email address. The "Wish
List" is sent from YOUR email address, NOT from our website address. 
</p>
<p>
<b>(3) Newsletters.</b>
If you decide that you want to, you can ask to receive a subscription
to one of our newsletters via email. Just click on the "Sign Up" button
under the Newsletters/Subscribe section on the homepage, or elsewhere
on the site. When you click on the Newsletter "Sign Up" button after
having entered your email address, we ask you to tell us how old you
are on the Registration Page. After you tell us your age, and if you
are below 13, a new page appears and asks for your parent's email
address. We keep your parent's email address so that your parent can
review, change, delete or block your email address from our newsletter
mailing list at any time. We keep your email address only so that we
can send you newsletters and only for as long as you want us to keep
sending them to you. If or when you decide that you don't want to
receive a newsletter anymore, just reply to any newsletter, put
"unsubscribe" in the subject line and we will stop sending it to you
and delete your email address from our mailing list for that
newsletter.
</p>
<p>
If you are under 13 years of age, and do not register on the Registration page, or
if your birthdate as entered is not valid for any reason, we treat your
email address as we would the email address of anyone under 13, and
keep it completely separate from your profile or any personally
identifiable information. Similarly, if you sign-up for a newsletter
and are already logged in or registered as someone under 13, your email
address is kept completely separate from your profile and any
personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
We have two newsletters that you
may subscribe to: THE TRIBUNE, and GENERAL TOY CAR NEWS. THE TRIBUNE is
a weekly newsletter about fun things to do, interesting historical
events, and little known facts. GENERAL TOY CAR NEWS is a note about
new games and content on the website, and news about the toy cars.
Remember, we won't send a newsletter to you automatically -- you have
to tell us that you want to receive it.
</p>
<p>
<b>(4) My Cars.</b>
If you have a collection of Chevron Cars at home, you can go to MY CARS
and make a list of your collection online so that you can keep track of
which cars you own. If you want to build and save your online
collection, just make sure that you are logged in and click on the "MY
CARS" icon that appears at the top of every page of the website. When
you get into MY CARS, you can add all of the cars you own and save the
list. Just click on the "Add to my Collection" button and click on the
car that you would like to add. You can also officially register each
of your cars. If you decide to officially register one of your cars you
will be asked the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>How did you acquire the car?</li>
<li>Where did you purchase the car?</li>
<li>When did you get your car?</li>
<li>How did you learn about this car?</li>
<li>What is your first name (so that we can display it on the certificate)?</li>
<li>Did you receive this car as a gift? If so, what is the first name of the person who gave it to you (so that we can display it on the certificate)?</li>
<li>How many of this car do you have?</li>
<li>You can also add personal notes about your car.</li>
</ul>
<p>
None of the information that you
tell us in MY CARS, by itself or in combination, is enough to tell us
who you are or how to contact you. When you've finished, you can print
your online collection, you can print your official certificate, or you
can email your online collection to your friends or family. When you
email your online collection to your friends or family, we do not save
either your email address or your friend's email address. Your
collection is sent from YOUR email address, NOT from our website
address.
</p>
<p>
<b>(5) Winning a Prize.</b>
From time to time, we sponsor contests online in which you will have
the chance to win a prize. If you win one of the contests, we will post
a message in the section that you entered the contest like Answering
Machine or Know-It-All. In order to know if you are a winner and to get
this message, you must be logged on to the site under your User Name.
Then, we will ask you to send us your parent's email address so that we
can send an email to your parent to let your mom or dad know that you
have won a prize on our website. We will also tell your mom or dad what
he or she needs to do to help you claim your prize. We will only use
personal information about you that we collect from your mom or dad for
the purpose of sending you the prize and we will delete your personal
information from our records immediately after sending you the prize.
</p>
<p>
<b>(6) Questions and Feedback.</b>
As you look at our site, you might decide to use our feedback page to
give us advice about what you think we are doing well, or what you
think we can do to make this website even better. If you want to give
us feedback, you may do so on the homepage or in the FREE STUFF section
without telling us anything about yourself. But, if you ask a question
and would like us to respond, you will need to give us your email
address. We will use your email address ONLY to respond to the question
or feedback that you sent to us, and then we will throw your email
address away. 
</p>
<p>
<b>(7) Cookies and Other Electronic Footprints.</b>
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard
drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies let us know if you come back
to Chevron Cars, so that we can say, "Hello, again" and they help us
keep track of your High Score on the games you play!!! You can set your
browser to refuse cookies if you want to, but it might interfere with
some of your activities on the site. 
</p>
<p>
When you are surfing the
different pages on our website, your electronic footprints allow our
computer to identify your computer using its IP address. Using the IP
address, our computer gathers certain information such as which pages
you visited and how long you stayed. But NONE of this information gives
us access to your name, where you live, your email or other personally
identifiable information. We use this anonymous information to help us
figure out what you like most about our site so that we can keep
improving it for everyone to enjoy!!
</p>
<p>
<b>(8) Electronic Postcards and "Email this page" button.</b>
When you send an electronic postcard to a friend or use the "email this
page" button to send a link to a friend, we ask for your email address
so that the person who receives the email knows who the email is from.
We do not however store your or your friend's email, and delete it
immediately after sending the message. When your friend views the
postcard you sent them on the site, they cannot see your email address.
</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<a name="reviewing"><h5>REVIEWING OR CHANGING YOUR INFORMATION</h5></a>
<p>
<b>GAMES AND ACTIVITIES:</b> If you want to view, change or delete the
information that you gave us to save your scores in the PLAYGROUND or
to make a "Wish List" in the KIDS SHOP, such as your Password or
birthday you can do so by clicking on the "My Profile" icon that will
appear in the top left corner of every page. When you click on the "My
Profile" icon, you will be asked to enter your password. Then, the form
that you filled out when you registered will appear. You may make
whatever changes you would like. When you are finished, press the
"Update" button to save your changes. You can change or delete your
information at any time. If your mom or dad wants to change or delete
your profile, they can do so at any time by sending us an email with
your Screen Name and Password to 
<a href="mailto:privacy2@chevroncars.com" class="a">privacy2@chevroncars.com</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NEWSLETTERS:</b>
If you want to review or change any information that you gave us to
receive a Newsletter, you may do so by clicking on the "Edit My
Subscription" on the bottom of each newsletter. This will take you to
the website where you may alter your email address or unsubscribe from
any or both newsletters. The link is coded so that only the recipient
of the email can come to the "Edit My Subscription" page. If you want
to cancel your subscription to a Newsletter, you may also do so by
replying to one of the newsletters and inserting "unsubscribe" in the
subject line. If you cancel all subscriptions, we will delete your
email address. If your mom or dad wants to block your Newsletter
subscriptions, he or she can send an email with "Data Collection Block"
in the subject line to 
<a href="mailto:privacy2@chevroncars.com" class="a">privacy2@chevroncars.com</a>.
We will then delete all of your information EXCEPT your parent's email
address, which we will keep. If your mom or dad has blocked your
subscriptions and you try to re-subscribe, we will block our collection
of any information from you when you enter your parent's email address.
We will then send your mom or dad an email telling them that you have
been back to our site. If your mom or dad decides it's okay for you to
subscribe again, they can send an email to profile2@chevroncars.com to
tell us to let you subscribe again. Finally, if we ever find that we
mistakenly have collected information that under this Privacy Policy we
said we wouldn't be collecting, we will delete that information from
our records immediately. 
</p>
<p>
<b>MY CARS:</b>
To view or edit your online collection in MY CARS, just make sure you
are logged in and click on the MY CARS button at the top of any page on
the website. Your online collection will appear and you will be able to
view, add, register or change information about a car, add a new car or
delete a car from your collection. If you want to unsubscribe from MY
CARS completely, just send an email to profile2@chevroncars.com and put
"REMOVE from MY CARS" in the subject line.

<p><em>(Please see above for <a href="#top" class="header5">Privacy 
Policy for Kids Under 13 and Their Parents</a>)</em></p>
<p>Welcome
to the Chevron Cars website!! Because we respect your privacy, we want
to disclose to you how we use the information that you provide to us
online. Most of our site is intended for children's use, and in our
Privacy Policy for Kids, we tell kids and their parents about our
collection and use of information from children under 13. 
</p>
<p>
The Chevron
Cars website is designed for kids of all ages to play games, have fun,
and learn new things. We have designed our site to include games,
activities and an online store called the KIDS SHOP. The KIDS SHOP
contains items we know are attractive to children and teenagers under
18, but we do not allow anyone under 18 years old to make a purchase in
the store. Of course, we encourage people of all ages to look at our
cool merchandise. However, we make it very clear to all users that you
must be 18 or older to make a purchase in our KIDS SHOP. In fact, you
can't make a purchase in the KIDS SHOP without a valid credit card.
Anybody under 18 wanting to make a purchase must ask their parents to
do it for them.

<b>(2) The Kids Shop.</b>
You may enter the KIDS SHOP and look at all of our great merchandise.
But, if you want to make and save a Wish List or make a purchase, we
ask you first to log in. If you have already registered in another
section of the website, the same Screen Name and Password will allow
you to log in at the KIDS SHOP. If you haven't previously registered on
the website, we ask you to register in the KIDS SHOP. To register, we
ask you to create a profile using a Screen Name, a Password, and your
birth date.
</p>
<p>
If you are 18 or older and are logged in with a Screen Name, we collect
additional information from you in the KIDS SHOP when you make a
purchase. We will ask for your actual name, address, credit card
number, telephone number, email address and birth date. We need all of
this information to sell you the item and to ship it to where you live.
Upon completion of the transaction, we will store all of this
information EXCEPT for your credit card number. If you input this
additional information and your credit card number is invalid, we will
store everything EXCEPT the invalid credit card number. We do not
disclose any of the information that you provide to us in the KIDS SHOP
to anybody else.
</p>
<p>
Our site makes it possible to create and email a "Wish List" of the things
you like in the KIDS SHOP to your friends and family. When you send
your "Wish List" to your friends, we do not store your email address or
your friend's email address. The "Wish List" is sent using your
personal email address, not our website address. Your "Wish List" will
not be saved unless you are logged in when you make your "Wish List."
If you are logged in when you make your "Wish List", we will save it
for you so you can see it the next time you visit.
</p>
<p>
There are no advertisers on our site collecting information about you, and we
do not sell our customer lists to anybody. If this policy changes, you
will be notified on this site, and you will have the option to request
that we not disclose your information.
</p>
<p>
<b>(3) Games, Newsletters, and Activities.</b>
We do not request any personally identifying information to play any of
the games and activities on the Chevron Cars site (excluding the
Newsletters and Feedback). If you haven't already been to the KIDS
SHOP, you will be asked to create a profile by choosing a Screen Name
and a Password and entering your birthday to participate in games and
activities. If you are 13 to 17, you will have the option to sign up to
receive email from the KIDS SHOP that will give you information on new
products and promotions but you will not be able to order from the site
unless you are 18 or older. If you do sign up to receive email from the
KIDS SHOP, you should enter your email address in the space provided
and we will store your email address along with the rest of your
profile. If you do not sign up to receive email from the KIDS SHOP, you
may enter your email address in the space provided but it is not
required. If you want to sign up for our Newsletters: GENERAL TOY CAR
NEWS and THE TRIBUNE, you may do so by clicking on the
Newsletters/Subscribe "Sign Up" button on the homepage or elsewhere on
the website. There you can enter your email address in the space
provided, and When when you click on the Newsletter "Sign Up" button,
we ask you to tell us your age if you are not already registered and
are not logged in. If you are not registered, and choose to skip this
page, then we treat your email address as we do anyone under the age of
13 and keep it completely separate from any personally identifiable
information. If you do register and are above the age of 13, we
associate your email address with your profile and you can edit it
through the My Profile tab on the site. You may also unsubscribe from
any newsletter or modify your email address by pressing the "Edit My
Subscription" button at the bottom of each newsletter, or reply to any
newsletter and put the word 'unsubscribe" in the subject line. 
</p>
<p>
You can build an online collection of the Chevron Cars that you own and
officially register each of your cars in MY CARS. Remember that your
online collection will not be saved unless you are logged in when you
build your online collection. You can also print your online
collection, print any of your registration certificates, or you can
email your online collection to your friends. When you email your
online collection to your friends, we do not store your email address
or your friend's email address. Your online collection is sent using
your personal email address, not our website address. 
</p>
<p>
From time to time, we sponsor contests online in which you will have the
chance to win a prize! If you win one of the contests, we will post a
message in the section that you entered the contest like Answering
Machine or Know-It-All. In order to know if you are a winner and to get
this message, you must be logged on to the site under your User Name.
We will also ask you for your email address so that we can send you an
email with instructions on how to claim the prize. This email will
include a toll-free phone number that you will need to call to claim
your prize. On the telephone, we will have to ask you for your name and
your mailing address so that we can send the prize to you. We will only
use your name and mailing address for the purpose of sending you the
prize and we will delete your name and mailing address from our records
immediately after sending you the prize.
</p>
<p>
When you send an electronic postcard to a friend, or use the "email this
page" button to send a link to a friend, we ask for your email address
so that the person who receives the email knows who the email is from.
We do not however store your or your friend's email, and delete it
immediately after sending the message. When your friend views the
postcard you sent them on the site, they cannot see your email address.
</p>
<p>
If we send you an answer to your feedback or a question, we will delete
your email address immediately after we respond. We do not share your
email address or any of the other information we collect with third
parties. Should this policy change, we will post a notice on our site
and provide you with the option to keep your information private.
