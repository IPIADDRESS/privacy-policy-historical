<h3>Privacy Policy for Kids Under 13 and Their Parents</h3>
<p><em>(Please see below for <a href="#top2">Privacy Policy for Everyone Over 13</a>)</em></p>
<p>
Welcome to the Chevron Cars website!! We are about to tell you some very important information, so please ask your mom or dad to come and read along with you. We are very concerned about protecting the privacy of children under 13. So, we think that it's important for you and your parents to understand and feel comfortable with how we collect information from you and how we use that information.</p>
<p>The Chevron Cars website is designed for kids of all ages to play games, have fun, and learn new things. We have packed our site with lots of different games, activities, and an online store called the KIDS SHOP. We hope that you'll look around the KIDS SHOP at all of the cool things, but you can't buy anything in the KIDS SHOP unless you are 18 years or older. If you are under 18 and you want to buy something, you'll have to ask your parents to buy it for you.
</p>
<p>
(1) The Kids Shop. Everyone is allowed to browse the KIDS SHOP and look at all the cool things for sale. BUT you MUST BE 18 OR OLDER and have a valid credit card to make a purchase. If you want to, you can make a "Wish List" of the cool things you like in the KIDS SHOP and send it in an email to your friends and family!! If you want to make and save a "Wish List" in the KIDS SHOP, you first will have to make sure that you have logged in with your Screen Name and Password. Once you are logged in, just click on the "Add to Wish List" button on any of the pages that feature a car or product and that item will be added to your "Wish List." You can view and edit your "Wish List" whenever you come back to the KIDS SHOP. To view it, simply make sure you are logged in and click on the Wish List icon at the top right hand of any page in the KIDS SHOP. Your Wish List will appear and you will be able to view and delete any of the items on your Wish List. If you want to, you can email your "Wish List" to friends and family. When you send your "Wish List", we don't save either your email address or your friend's email address. The "Wish List" is sent from YOUR email address, NOT from our website address.</p>
<p>
(2) Newsletters. If you decide that you want to, you can ask to receive a subscription to one of our newsletters via email. Just click on the "Sign Up" button under the Newsletters/Subscribe section on the homepage, or elsewhere on the site. When you click on the Newsletter "Sign Up" button after having entered your email address, we ask you to tell us how old you are on the Registration Page. After you tell us your age, and if you are below 13, a new page appears and asks for your parent's email address. We keep your parent's email address so that your parent can review, change, delete or block your email address from our newsletter mailing list at any time. We keep your email address only so that we can send you newsletters and only for as long as you want us to keep sending them to you. If or when you decide that you don't want to receive a newsletter anymore, just reply to any newsletter, put "unsubscribe" in the subject line and we will stop sending it to you and delete your email address from our mailing list for that newsletter.</p>
<p>
If you are under 13 years of age, and do not register on the Registration page, or if your birthdate as entered is not valid for any reason, we treat your email address as we would the email address of anyone under 13, and keep it completely separate from your profile or any personally identifiable information. Similarly, if you sign-up for a newsletter and are already logged in or registered as someone under 13, your email address is kept completely separate from your profile and any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>
We have two newsletters that you may subscribe to: THE TRIBUNE, and GENERAL TOY CAR NEWS. THE TRIBUNE is a weekly newsletter about fun things to do, interesting historical events, and little known facts. GENERAL TOY CAR NEWS is a note about new games and content on the website, and news about the toy cars. Remember, we won't send a newsletter to you automatically -- you have to tell us that you want to receive it.</p>
<p>
(3) Questions and Feedback. As you look at our site, you might decide to use our feedback page to give us advice about what you think we are doing well, or what you think we can do to make this website even better. If you want to give us feedback, you may do so on the homepage without telling us anything about yourself. But, if you ask a question and would like us to respond, you will need to give us your email address. We will use your email address ONLY to respond to the question or feedback that you sent to us, and then we will throw your email address away.
</p><p>
(4) Cookies and Other Electronic Footprints. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies let us know if you come back to Chevron Cars.You can set your browser to refuse cookies if you want to, but it might interfere with some of your activities on the site.
</p><p>
When you are surfing the different pages on our website, your electronic footprints allow our computer to identify your computer using its IP address. Using the IP address, our computer gathers certain information such as which pages you visited and how long you stayed. But NONE of this information gives us access to your name, where you live, your email or other personally identifiable information. We use this anonymous information to help us figure out what you like most about our site so that we can keep improving it for everyone to enjoy!!

REVIEWING OR CHANGING YOUR INFORMATION
</p><p>
NEWSLETTERS: If you want to review or change any information that you gave us to receive a Newsletter, you may do so by clicking on the "Edit My Subscription" on the bottom of each newsletter. This will take you to the website where you may alter your email address or unsubscribe from any or both newsletters. The link is coded so that only the recipient of the email can come to the "Edit My Subscription" page. If you want to cancel your subscription to a Newsletter, you may also do so by replying to one of the newsletters and inserting "unsubscribe" in the subject line. If you cancel all subscriptions, we will delete your email address. If your mom or dad wants to block your Newsletter subscriptions, he or she can send an email with "Data Collection Block" in the subject line to privacy2@chevroncars.com. We will then delete all of your information EXCEPT your parent's email address, which we will keep. If your mom or dad has blocked your subscriptions and you try to re-subscribe, we will block our collection of any information from you when you enter your parent's email address. We will then send your mom or dad an email telling them that you have been back to our site. If your mom or dad decides it's okay for you to subscribe again, they can send an email to profile2@chevroncars.com to tell us to let you subscribe again. Finally, if we ever find that we mistakenly have collected information that under this Privacy Policy we said we wouldn't be collecting, we will delete that information from our records immediately.

<a name="top2">Privacy Policy for Everyone Over 13 Years Old</a>
(Please see above for <a href="#top">Privacy Policy for Kids Under 13 and Their Parents</a>)</p><p>
Welcome to the Chevron Cars website!! Because we respect your privacy, we want to disclose to you how we use the information that you provide to us online. Most of our site is intended for children's use, and in our Privacy Policy for Kids, we tell kids and their parents about our collection and use of information from children under 13.</p><p>
The Chevron Cars website is designed for kids of all ages to play games, have fun, and learn new things. We have designed our site to include games, activities and an online store called the KIDS SHOP. The KIDS SHOP contains items we know are attractive to children and teenagers under 18, but we do not allow anyone under 18 years old to make a purchase in the store. Of course, we encourage people of all ages to look at our cool merchandise. However, we make it very clear to all users that you must be 18 or older to make a purchase in our KIDS SHOP. In fact, you can't make a purchase in the KIDS SHOP without a valid credit card. Anybody under 18 wanting to make a purchase must ask their parents to do it for them.

WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE THAT INFORMATION:
</p><p>
Following is a list of the kinds of information we collect on our site, and how we use that information.
</p><p>
(1) Cookies and Other Electronic Footprints. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. The cookies used on this site are used for games and activities, so that we can keep track of scores and welcome users back to play more games. If you set your browser to decline cookies, you may find that some parts of the site will not function properly.
</p><p>
When you are surfing the different pages on our website, your electronic footprints allow our computer to identify your computer using its IP address. Using your IP address, our computer gathers certain information such as which pages you visited and how long you stayed. But, the information that we obtain from your IP address does not allow us to access to any of your identifying information. We use this anonymous information to help us determine which areas of our site people are visiting most so that we can make appropriate improvements to the site.
</p><p>
(2) The Kids Shop. You may enter the KIDS SHOP and look at all of our great merchandise. But, if you want to make and save a Wish List or make a purchase, we ask you first to log in. If you have already registered in another section of the website, the same Screen Name and Password will allow you to log in at the KIDS SHOP. If you haven't previously registered on the website, we ask you to register in the KIDS SHOP. To register, we ask you to create a profile using a Screen Name, a Password, and your birth date.
</p><p>
If you are 18 or older and are logged in with a Screen Name, we collect additional information from you in the KIDS SHOP when you make a purchase. We will ask for your actual name, address, credit card number, telephone number, email address and birth date. We need all of this information to sell you the item and to ship it to where you live. Upon completion of the transaction, we will store all of this information EXCEPT for your credit card number. If you input this additional information and your credit card number is invalid, we will store everything EXCEPT the invalid credit card number. We do not disclose any of the information that you provide to us in the KIDS SHOP to anybody else.
</p><p>
There are no advertisers on our site collecting information about you, and we do not sell our customer lists to anybody. If this policy changes, you will be notified on this site, and you will have the option to request that we not disclose your information.
