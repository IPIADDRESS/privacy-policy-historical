<h5>7. What are your choices regarding online tracking, analytics and certain email communications from Checkr?</h5>
<ul>
<li><i>Online Tracking and Cookies</i>. Like many websites, the Services do not currently respond to “do not track” browser headers. But you can take steps to limit tracking by erasing cookies from your computer’s hard drive and by setting your browser to block all cookies or warn you before a cookie is stored. If you disable cookies, you may be prevented from taking full advantage of the Services because they may not function properly without cookies.</li>
<li><i>Analytics</i>. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here. <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>
<li><i>Promotional Emails</i>. As discussed in this Policy, subject to any restrictions under applicable laws, we may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you. You may opt-out of such communications by clicking unsubscribe in the email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails about your account or any services you have requested or received from us.</li>
<li><i>Opting Out of Checkr Text Messages</i>. The number of text messages you receive may depend upon factors including how you use our services and whether you take steps to generate additional text messages from us (such as by sending a&nbsp;<b>HELP</b>&nbsp;request). If you no longer want to receive Checkr text messages, you may text&nbsp;<b>STOP</b>&nbsp;at any time. After doing so, we will send you confirmation of your opt-out via text message. If you have revoked consent and want to re-enroll in our text message program, you can re-enroll by emailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@checkr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support@checkr.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-8">
<h5>8. How does Checkr protect your information?</h5>
<p>Checkr maintains safeguards to help protect the security of information we maintain about you. We may use encryption, passwords, and physical security measures to help protect your information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no security measures are 100% effective and we cannot guarantee your information will not be collected, disclosed and/or used by others. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your log-in and password private, and not recycling passwords from other websites or accounts. Checkr is not responsible for the unauthorized use of your information nor for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity. <strong>WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ENSURING, GUARANTEEING, OR OTHERWISE OFFERING ANY DEFINITIVE PROMISE OF SECURITY IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR INFORMATION OR TECHNICAL INFORMATION.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="section-9">
<h5>9. Where is your information processed or stored?</h5>
<p>Checkr uses servers located in the United States. Checkr may also use partners or affiliates located in other countries besides the US to store and process your information. By using the Services, you consent to the transfer of information outside of your country, even if your country has more rigorous data protection standards.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-10">
<h5>10. Who can use the Services?</h5>
<p>YYou must be 18 years of age or older to use the Services.

<div id="canadian-users">
<h5><i>Additional Information for Canadian Users</i></h5>
<p>This Policy applies to customers, users and applicants in both Canada and the United States. However, to the extent that this Policy is inconsistent with any applicable Canadian laws, Checkr will comply with the applicable law for customers, users and applicants in Canada. For example, Checkr will only send commercial electronic messages to persons located in Canada with explicit, opt-in consent, unless otherwise permitted pursuant to Canadian legislation that is applicable to such activities.</p>
<p>Applicants who are located in Canada should also understand that the nature of the Services will involve Checkr obtaining potentially sensitive personal information about them, including consumer reports, criminal record, driving record, as well as education and employment records, from third parties such as consumer reporting agencies, police services and government agencies (e.g., provincial transportation ministries).</p>
<p>Checkr will also share Applicants’ personal information with a third party service provider in Canada, for the purpose of completing or facilitating the background checks described in this Policy.</p>
<p>In addition, as indicated under Question #9 above, personal information that is collected in the course of providing the Services will be transferred outside Canada. Therefore, such information may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities in the jurisdiction(s) where it is stored or processed.</p>
<p>Canadian customers, users and applicants will be notified of any material changes to this Policy, where such change would result in use or disclosure of their personal information by Checkr in a manner not contemplated by this Policy or reasonably expected by the individual.</p>
<div id="european-users">
<h5><i>Additional Information for European Users</i></h5>
<p>European Union data protection laws make a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “data processors”)</p>
<p>Under applicable law, Checkr is considered the “data controller” of the personal data we handle under this Privacy Policy. We retain the personal data for as long as necessary to provide the Services, or for other important purposes such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.</p>
<p><i>Our legal grounds for using personal data are as follows:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Contractual Commitments</i>: We may use, share, or disclose information to honor our contractual commitments to you. For example, to comply with our Terms, which you by using our Service.</li>
<li><i>With Your Consent</i>: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the basis of your consent.</li>
<li><i>Legitimate Interests</i>: In many cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, analyzing and improving our business, providing security for our Services, preventing fraud, and managing legal issues.</li>
<li><i>Legal Compliance</i>: We need to use, share, and disclose information in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Your Legal Rights Under Local Law:</i><br>
Your local laws (e.g., laws of the E.U.) may permit you to request that we:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you;</li>
<li>prevent the processing of your information for direct-marketing purposes; (including any direct marketing processing based on profiling)</li>
<li>update information which is out of date or incorrect;</li>
<li>delete certain information that we are holding about you;</li>
<li>restrict the way that we process and disclose certain of your information;</li>
<li>transfer your information to a third party provider of services; and</li>
<li>revoke your consent for the processing of your information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include needing to continue processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to your request.</p>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, you may review the information provided in Sections 4, 5, and 7, or contact us as described in the <i>“How can I contact you with more questions?”</i>section above. In addition to those rights, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. However, we encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve your concern.</p>
<p>As described above, Checkr uses servers located in the United States. Checkr may also use partners or affiliates located in other countries besides the US to store and process your information. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge any such transfer, storage or use. If we provide any information about you to any such non-EU third party information processors, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
