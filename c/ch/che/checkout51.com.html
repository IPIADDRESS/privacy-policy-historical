<p id="info-obtain">Information We Obtain</p>
<p>We obtain personal information about consumers through the Services, publicly and commercially available sources
and from our NAM affiliates and/or business partners (such as consumer product companies, retailers, social
media networks, etc.). The types of personal information we may obtain include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contact information (such as name, postal address, email address and telephone and/or mobile numbers);</p></li>
<li><p>Username and password when you register through our Services;</p></li>
<li><p>Other registration information such as store loyalty card numbers you elect to register;</p></li>
<li><p>Geolocation data;</p></li>
<li><p>Information on receipts uploaded to us through the Services, such as the items and date(s) of your
purchases, prices of the items, methods of payment, the last four digits of your credit card number,
signature, and names and locations of the merchants (“Receipt Data”);
</p></li>
<li><p>Purchase transaction data and other data provided by our business partners that we match to you through
information you have provided to us, such as store loyalty card numbers, contact information or other
identifying information;
</p></li>
<li><p>Contact information for friends or other people you would like us to contact</p></li>
<li><p>Other information you may provide to us, such as through our “Submit a Request” feature.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="info-obtain-auto">Information Obtained by Automated Means Through Our Services</p>
<p>We also may obtain certain information through our Services by automated means, such as cookies (including HTTP,
HTML5 and Flash cookies), web beacons, web server logs, JavaScript and similar technologies, including
technologies designed to obtain information regarding your use of our Services. The information we obtain in
this manner may include IP address, mobile device advertising ID, browser characteristics, device
characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our
Services, and dates and times you access or use the Services. In connection with our mobile apps, we also may
obtain your phone number and details about your mobile carrier.</p>
<p>A “cookie” is a file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely
identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon” also known as
an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to
transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Through these automated collection methods,
we obtain “clickstream data,” which is a log of the links and other content on which a visitor clicks while
browsing a website. As the visitor clicks through the website, a record of the action may be collected and
stored. We also may use similar automated means to obtain and store information regarding your actions while
using our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We may link certain data elements obtained through automated means, such as your browser or device information,
with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you have opened an email
we sent to you, what search queries you may have run and what advertisements you may have seen on our Services
or on third-party websites and apps. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types
of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. You also may be able to delete your Flash
cookies or adjust your Flash cookie settings by visiting the Adobe Flash <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html?external=true">Website
Storage</a> <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html?external=true">Settings
Panel</a> and
<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html?external=true">Global
Storage Settings Panel</a>. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the
features of our Services. Your device settings also may allow you to prohibit mobile app platforms (such as
Apple and Google) from sharing certain information obtained by automated means with app developers such as
Checkout 51 and SmartSource.
</p>
<p>In addition, if you register for Checkout 51 or SmartSource through or connect your Checkout 51 or SmartSource
account to a third-party social media network (such as Facebook or Twitter), we may obtain certain information
about you from the relevant social media network, such as your user ID and/or user name associated with that
social media network, the information contained in your public profile on the social media network and friends
lists. The specific information we obtain depends on your privacy settings on the applicable social media
network.
</p>
<p>The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our Services, such as social media sharing
tools, also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This
information is collected directly by the providers of those features and is subject to the privacy policies or
notices of those providers. NAM is not responsible for those providers’ information practices.
</p>
<p id="how-info-obtain">How We Use the Information We Obtain</p>

<p>We may use third-party analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. The analytics
providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, web server logs and
similar technologies to help us analyze your use of the Services. The information collected through these means
may be disclosed to these analytics providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for
example, to evaluate use of the Services. To learn more about how to opt out of Google Analytics services,

<p> We also may use your personal information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of
collection.</p>
<p id="iba">Interest-Based Advertising</p>
<p>On our sites, apps and/or emails we and our third-party service providers may obtain information about your
activities to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. We
and our third-party service providers also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party websites and
apps. This section of our Privacy Notice provides details and explains how to exercise your choices.</p>
<p>We engage third-party advertising networks to help us target our messaging to visitors through interest-based and
contextual means. Through these ad networks, we can track your online activities over time and across
third-party websites and apps by obtaining information through automated means, as described above. The networks
use this information to show you advertisements on our Services or other third-party websites and apps that may
be tailored to your individual interests. The information our ad networks may obtain on our behalf includes data
about your visits to websites and use of apps that serve NAM advertisements, such as the pages or ads you view
and the actions you take on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on our sites, apps and
emails and on third-party websites and apps that participate in these ad networks. This process also helps us

specifying that this is your preference.</p>
<p>We may also obtain the date, time and content of your messages in the course of your use of Text Messages. We
will use the information we obtain in connection with our Text Messages in accordance with this Privacy
Notice.</p>
<p>From time to time you may be asked to provide your mobile phone number to NAM in connection with specific text
messaging programs. Some text messaging programs may have additional or different terms and conditions from
those set forth above, which will be presented to you at the time that you opt-in to receive those Text
Messages.</p>
<p>In general, in order to stop receiving Text Messages from a specific NAM text messaging program, you can text
STOP to the short code for the text messaging program from which you no longer wish to receive message (i.e.,
the number from which its Text Messages are being sent). You will then receive confirmation of your opt-out of
that text messaging program. This will only opt you out of the specific text messaging program associated with
that short code. You will remain opted in to any other NAM text messaging programs that you have signed up
for.</p>
<p id="push-notif">Push Notifications and In-App Alerts and Updates </p>
<p>When you download one of our mobile applications, we may provide you with the option to opt in to receive push
notifications from NAM on your mobile device in connection with that mobile application. These push
notifications may include promotional communications regarding NAM products and services. You may, after
downloading the applicable mobile application, opt out of receiving push notifications by adjusting the settings
on your mobile device. Opting out of push notifications will not affect other communications you receive from
NAM, such as email communications. You also may receive alerts and updates within our mobile applications
regarding NAM products and services or your NAM accounts. To opt out of receiving these alerts and updates, you
may uninstall the applicable mobile application from your mobile&nbsp;device.</p>
<p id="info-share">Information We Share </p>
<p>We may share consumer personal information with</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Our subsidiaries and affiliates, any of whom may use your personal information consistent with this Privacy
Notice or for the subsidiary’s or affiliate’s own purposes, including marketing purposes. A current list of
our affiliated companies is available at <a href="https://checkout51.com/affiliatedcompanies?external=true">https://checkout51.com/affiliatedcompanies</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Service providers in the US and other jurisdictions who perform services on our behalf.</p></li>
<li><p>Our third party clients or business partners, such as consumer product companies and other third parties for
those third parties’ own marketing purposes, such as to serve targeted advertisements.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>From time to time, using encryption technology, we may compare our consumer member databases with our
affiliates’, clients’ and/or partners’ databases to identify overlap between the databases. When there is an
overlap between databases, we may share with those affiliates, clients and/or partners information such as
Receipt Data and other data collected via automated means, as described above, of the matched consumers. Those
parties may use this information as permitted under their own privacy notices, including to contact consumers
and/or to send targeted advertising or other promotional materials.</p>
<p>In addition, when the information collected from or about you does not identify you as a specific person, we may
share it with third parties. </p>
<p>The Services may include iFrames that allow a third party to provide you with additional services, features or
functions. For example, on <a href="http://www.smartsource.com?external=true">www.smartsource.com</a>, <a href="http://www.smartsource.ca?external=true">www.smartsource.ca</a> and the SmartSource mobile app, we
may
include iFrames that allow a third party to provide you with the ability to load coupons directly onto store
loyalty cards or payment cards. We do not collect the personal information you provide in these iFrames. Rather,
the personal information you provide for that feature is obtained by the third party providing the ability to
load promotions directly onto your card. We will notify you when you go to one of these iFrames and provide a
link to the relevant third party’s privacy notice. We recommend you review the third party’s privacy notice
before submitting any personal information.</p>
<p>In addition, we may disclose information about you (1) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (2)
to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, and (3) when we believe disclosure is necessary or
appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or
actual fraudulent or illegal activity. We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about
you in the event of a proposed or completed sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets
(including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation). </p>
<p id="choices">Your Choices </p>
<p>We offer you certain choices in connection with the personal information we obtain about you, such as how we
communicate with you. </p>
<p>To update your preferences, ask us to remove your information from our marketing mailing lists (such as
Checkout51’s weekly reminder email) or submit a request, please contact us as outlined in the <a href="#contact-us">How to Contact Us</a>
Section below. Additionally, all users can change their notification preferences and Canadian users can change their email and data sharing preferences in the Settings section of the Checkout 51 mobile app.</p>
<p>You also can unsubscribe from our marketing mailing lists by following the “Unsubscribe” link in our emails.</p>
<p>In general, in order to stop receiving text messages, you can text STOP to the short code for the text messaging
program from which you no longer wish to receive message (i.e., the number from which the text messages are
being sent).&nbsp; You will then receive confirmation of your opt-out of that text messaging program. Please note
that this will only opt you out of the specific text messaging program associated with that short code. You will
remain opted in to any other NAM text messaging programs that you may have signed up for. To unsubscribe from
the NAM general marketing text messaging program you can text “STOP” to the short code listed <a href="https://support.checkout51.com/hc/en-us/articles/232025387?external=true">here</a> from your

transferred, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States and/or
such country. Your consent includes the use of cookies and other tracking technologies as described above. When

<p>For your convenience and information, our Services may provide links to third-party sites, apps and services that
