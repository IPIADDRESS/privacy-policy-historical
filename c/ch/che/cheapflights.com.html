Cheapflights.com, which is owned by Cheapflights (USA) Inc has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for Cheapflights’ web site (“Cheapflights.com”) as well as e-mail newsletters. It is important for you to understand what information we collect about you during your visit and what we do with that information.<br><br>
This Privacy Policy only applies to information collected on Cheapflights.com and not to information that is collected by Cheapflights through any other means. Your visit to Cheapflights.com is subject to this Privacy Policy and our <a href="/misc/terms-and-conditions.html">Terms of Use</a><br><br>
<b> 1. Personal Information Collection and Use </b><br><br>
We do not collect personally identifiable information about you, except when you provide it to us. For example, if you submit an inquiry to us, sign up for our weekly newsletters or a sweepstake on Cheapflights.com, you may be asked to provide certain information such as your contact information (name, e-mail address, mailing address, etc.). <br><br>
When you submit your personally identifiable information through Cheapflights.com, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any such information. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent, except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy. <br><br>
Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we will use the information you provide us only for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or in connection with the service for which you provided such information. For example, if you opt-in to our e-mail alert, we may use your e-mail address to send you periodic e-mails. We may forward your contact information and inquiry to our affiliates and other divisions of our company that we feel can best address your inquiry or provide you with the requested service. We may also use the information you provide in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans. We may share or transfer such non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees, agents and partners. <br><br>
We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include, without limitation, customer support and fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that coordinate mailings). Such third parties may be provided with access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose. <br><br>
In addition, we may disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal proceeding or governmental request. <br><br>
<b> 2. Email addresses </b><br><br>
 Cheapflights.com publishes regular e-mail newsletters. Users can sign up for newsletters from our home page by providing their e-mail address. This information will not be shared with third parties. Information on how to unsubscribe is also included in every newsletter. We would not provide your email address to a third party unless you asked us to. For example, sweepstakes entries may require you to provide an email address, because in such cases you will often have the option to receive information directly from the prize provider. <br><br>
<b> 3. Log Files </b><br><br>
 Cheapflights.com records details of individual accesses to its web pages. This information may include details of Internet IP addresses and browser types. We use this information to provide a more relevant site for you. In addition, we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Access by third parties to full log files may be allowed under controlled circumstances for the purposes of auditing. Abstracted log information not showing individual's actual Internet addresses is provided to third parties. <br><br>
<b> 4. Cookies </b><br><br>

 <br>
<b> 5. Third Party Sites and Booking Tools</b><br><br>
 Cheapflights.com does not sell you travel products or services, but directs you to third party web sites that do. These sites may collect personally identifiable information from you, such as your name, address, credit card details or details pertaining to other methods of payment. These sites may have their own privacy policies which will govern how such sites use and share your personally identifiable information. In addition, Cheapflights.com displays third party booking tools. When you utilize these third party booking tools, you are subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of those third parties. <br><br>
This Privacy Policy applies only to the information we collect on Cheapflights.com. Please note that Cheapflights has no input into, and is not responsible for, the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of other web sites you link to from Cheapflights.com. <br><br>
<b> 6. Third Party Advertisers </b><br><br>
The advertising banners and other forms of advertising appearing on this website are sometimes delivered to you, on our behalf, by a third party. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, the third party may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.

<b> 7. Business Transfers</b><br><br>
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell certain of our entities or assets. In such transactions, user information, including personally identifiable information, generally is one of the transferred business assets, and by submitting your personal information on Cheapflights.com you agree that your data may be transferred to such parties in these circumstances. <br><br>
<b> 8. Notification of Changes</b><br><br>
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised policy here. As we may make changes at any time without notifying you, we suggest that you periodically consult this Privacy Policy. Please note that our rights to use your personally identifiable information will be based on the privacy policy in effect at the time the information is used. <br><br>
