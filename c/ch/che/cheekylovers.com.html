<b>Cookies</b>
<p>We may collect information about your computer, including (where available) your IP address, operating system, and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns and does not identify any individual. For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general Internet usage by using a cookie file stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve the Site and to deliver a better and more personalized service. They enable us:

<p>You can set your browser to not accept cookies and the above website tells you how to do that. However, in a few cases some of the features on our Site may not function as a result. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to the Site.</p>
<b>Where we store your personal data</b>
<p>The personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a location outside the United States ('<b>USA</b>').

By submitting your personal data to us through the Site, you agree to this transfer, storing, or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
