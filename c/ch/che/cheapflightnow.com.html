                          <p> We receive and store any information you enter on our Site or give us by telephone, e-mail, fax, or in any other way. 
                            This includes information that can identify you, including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and e-mail addresses, 
                            and, in some cases, billing information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date), ("personal information"). 
                            We also may request information about your traveler preferences, including meal requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental 
                            program information, and ticketing options. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is

                            contest, or sweepstakes; ask us a question; or initiate other transactions. </p>

                          <h4> Passenger Information </h4>
                          <p> When you make travel or other arrangements for someone else through SF, we will request personal information 
                            and travel preferences about that individual. You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to 
                            providing SF with their personal information and travel preferences, as any access to view or change their 
                            information will be available only through your account. </p>

                          <p> We also may periodically obtain information about you from our business partners and other independent 
                            third-party sources and add it to our account information. Examples of information we may receive include: 
                            updated delivery and address information, which we use to correct our records and to facilitate proper delivery 
                            of travel information; and demographic information, which we use to better understand your potential purchasing 
                            preferences. </p>

                          <p> We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit the Site. For example, we will 
                            collect your IP address, Web browser software (such as Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), and referring 
                            Web site. We also may collect information about your online activity. One of our goals in collecting this automatic 
                            information is to help customize your user experience. </p>

                          <h4> Cookies and Other Web Technologies </h4>
                          <p> When you visit the Site, we may assign your computer a "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file). For example, 
                            whenever you sign in as a SF member, we record your member ID and the name on your member account in the cookie 
                            file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you checked the box entitled "Save 
                            this password for automatic sign-in." Note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included 
                            in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes. You can always choose not to receive a cookie file by enabling 
                            your Web browser to refuse cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. Please note that if you refuse to 
                            accept cookies from SF, you may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered by SF. </p>

                          <p> Third-party advertisers, such as those we use to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet, may use cookies 
                            and other methods to measure the effectiveness of their ads; to analyze, modify, and personalize advertising 
                            content on SF and other sites; and to provide ads about goods and services we hope will be of interest to you. 
                            We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features they may use, and the information practices 
                            of these advertisers are not covered by this Privacy Policy. </p>

                      <h3> <a name="2"></a>How We Use Your Information </h3>
                      <p> SF uses sensitive billing information (such as cardholder name, credit card number, and expiration date) for the purpose 
                        of completing the travel purchases you make. We use other information about you for the following general purposes: to 
                        provide you with the products and services you request; to provide you with travel confirmation and updates; to manage 
                        your account, including processing bills and providing travel notifications; to communicate with you in general; to

                        you about special offers and products or services that may be of interest to you; to otherwise customize your experience 
                        with SF; to reward you as part of any reward and recognition program you choose to join; to solicit information from you, 
                        including through surveys; to resolve disputes, collect fees, or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited 
                        or illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection. </p>

                      <h3> <a name="3"></a>With whom we share your information? </h3>
                      <p> SF may share your information with the following entities: </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p> Suppliers, such as hotel, airline, cruise, or car rental companies, or activity providers, who fulfill your 
                            travel reservations. Throughout SF, all services provided by a third-party supplier are described as such. 
                            We do not share your email address with these suppliers unless they need it to fulfill the travel reservation 
                            you have made through SF, and we restrict their use of this information to that purpose. We do not place 
                            limitations on our suppliers' use or disclosure of your other personal information. Therefore, we encourage 
                            you to review the privacy policies of any travel supplier whose products you purchase through SF. Please 
                            note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you or 
                            to facilitate your travel reservation. </p>

                            customer service, marketing, and fraud prevention. These companies have access to personal information

                          <p> Business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services. You can tell when a third party is 
                            involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear with ours. If you choose to 
                            access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with 
                            those partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners 
                            and recommend you evaluate their practices before deciding to provide your personal information. </p>

                            defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or

                        For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors a Web site receives or what are the most popular 
                        vacation destinations. This information does not contain any personal information and is used to develop content

                      <p> We want you to feel confident about using SF to plan and purchase your travel, so we are committed to 
                        protecting the information we collect. While no Web site can guarantee security, we have implemented

                        and they only may do so for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption when transmitting 
                        your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion 
                        detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information. </p>
