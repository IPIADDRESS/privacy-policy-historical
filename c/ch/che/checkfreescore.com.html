  <h5>We Are Committed to Safeguarding Customer Information </h5>
  <p>In order to better serve your needs now and in the future, we may ask you to provide us with certain information. In order to provide the products and services you request from us, we may also obtain consumer reports and other information from consumer reporting agencies, our affiliate consumer reporting agency companies, and other data and information providers. We understand that you may be concerned about what we will do with such information - particularly any personal or financial information. We agree that you have a right to know how we will utilize such information. Therefore, we have adopted this Privacy Policy to govern the use and handling of your personal information. </p>
  <h5>Applicability </h5>
  <p>This Privacy Policy governs our use of the information that you provide to us or we otherwise obtain in providing our products and services to you. Our partner company, CSIdentity Corporation, Inc. ("CSID"), has also adopted guidelines that govern our use of personal information which can be found on CSID's website at http://www.csid.com/privacy-policy/.</p>
  <h5>Types of Information </h5>
  <p>Depending upon which of our services you are utilizing, the types of nonpublic personal information that we may
collect include: 
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Information we receive from you on applications (either applications with us directly or through our clients), forms and in other communications to us, whether in writing, in person, by telephone or any other means</li>
    <li>Information about your transactions with us, our affiliated companies, or others; and</li>
    <li>Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency and other data and information providers.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Changes to Information </h5>
  <p>If you want to update or correct information you have provided to CheckFreeScore.com, you can do so by sending us a letter to 5100 Buckeystown Pike Suite 250  Frederick, MD 21704. If you want to correct information in a consumer report we provide on you that you believe is incorrect, you can do so through the dispute resolution process provided under the Fair Credit Reporting Act or other applicable laws. <br>
    Use of Information </p>
  <p>We request information from you or obtain information about you for our own legitimate business purposes and not for the benefit of any third party. Therefore, we will not release your information to any party, whether affiliated with us or not, except: (1) as necessary for us or a third party to provide the product or service you have requested; or (2) as permitted by law. We may, however, store such information, including during the period after which any customer relationship has ceased. Such information may be used for any internal purpose, such as quality control efforts or customer analysis.</p>
  <h5>Former Customers </h5>
  <p>Even if you are no longer our customer, our Privacy Policy will continue to apply to you.</p>
  <h5>Confidentiality and Security </h5>
  <p>We will use our best efforts to: (a) protect the confidentiality of your nonpublic personal information (including your social security number) and ensure that no unauthorized parties have access to any of your information, (b) restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those individuals and entities that need to know that information to provide products or services to you, and (c) prevent the unlawful disclosure of your nonpublic personal information (including your social security number).
