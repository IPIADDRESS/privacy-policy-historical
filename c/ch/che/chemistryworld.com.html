This Notice establishes our global principles for the collection, use and disclosure of information gathered through our websites and applications. The country in which you are doing business with us or where the website you are visiting is located/hosted may have specific requirements concerning personal information.The data that we collect from you may be stored in a location outside of the European Economic Area. Where we transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, we ensure it is protected by making sure at least one of the following safeguards is in place:by transferring your personal information to a country that has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the European Commission;by using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give your personal information the same protection it has within the EEA; orwe may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.We have not set out the specific circumstances when each of these protection measures are used. You can contact us at  DPO@rsc.org for the details as to how we protect specific transfer of your data.Children’s dataWe recognise any individual under the age of 18 years old as being a child. We take safeguarding of children (including the protection of their personal data) seriously and will take all reasonable steps to ensure that children are provided with sufficiently clear information on how we will collect, process and store their personal data, and that children and their guardians understand the nature of the processing of their personal data together with their rights in respect of the same.Children below the age of 13 years old will always require the consent of an adult with parental responsibility to provide personal data to, and consent to the processing of that data with us.Save for photography and filming, children between the ages of 13 years old and 18 years old may be able to provide consent in their own right to the processing of their personal data depending on their maturity and ability to understand the nature of the processing of that data. We will take reasonable steps to assess a child’s maturity and ability to understand the nature of data processing before determining whether a child can reasonably consent to processing in their own right. Further information on how we will assess a child’s ability to consent in their own right can be supplied on request via our contact details above.Special categories of personal dataWe may collect special categories of personal data if it is provided to us by you, or on your behalf with your consent and it is appropriate to the service that we will provide to you. By giving us this information, you agree that we may use such information as set out in this Notice.Examples of sensitive information that we may collect are: gender and marital status.Data anonymisation and aggregationWe may anonymise or aggregate your personal information in such a way as to ensure that you are not identified or identifiable from it, in order to use the anonymised or aggregated data, for example, for statistical analysis and administration including analysis of trends, to carry out actuarial work, to tailor products and services and to conduct risk assessment and analysis of costs and charges in relation to our products and services. We may share anonymised or aggregated data with third parties.Your rightsWe also offer the following controls:You may request access to, or copies of, the personal information that we hold about you. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us at DPO@rsc.org or the RSC designated address above;If you believe that any data we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, or have concerns as to how we are using your data please contact us at DPO@rsc.org as soon as possible. We will take steps to seek to correct or update any data if we are satisfied that the data we hold is inaccurate.You may request that your personal data is deleted, where it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it is being processed and provided there is no other lawful basis for which we may continue to process such information;If we are processing your personal information to meet our legitimate interests, you may object to the processing of your personal information by us. If we are unable to demonstrate our legitimate grounds for that processing, we will no longer process your personal information for those purposes;You may withdraw any consent given to processing (this will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal); orIf we are processing your personal information automatically, for the purposes of performing our contract with you, or based on your consent you may have the right to request that the personal information we hold about you be transferred to a third party data controller.If you consider that we are in breach of our obligations under data protection laws, you may lodge a complaint with the  Information Commissioner’s Office. You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or of an alleged infringement of the GDPR.RetentionWe have criteria in place in relation to how we determine the period for which we use your personal information, as well as a process for deletion of your personal information at the end of the relevant retention period. For more information please contact our Data Protection Officer at the address shown above. In certain circumstances, we may be required to retain your personal information for longer where such retention is required by law or record-keeping requirements, including managing our relationship with you, defending any claims, or for tax purposes. Changes to this NoticeThis statement is not a contract, and it does not create any legal rights or obligations.

<li>Based on your consent: for example to send you marketing communications where we’ve asked for your consent to do so.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>We want to share information and news about our products and services with you. We can do this in various ways including e-mail, post, phone or social media (or such other method(s) as may become relevant) but only if you would like us to.</p>
<p>In accordance with applicable laws and lawful basis for processing, we may use your personal information to provide you with direct marketing information about our products and services as well as those of third parties and to take part in our marketing research.</p>
<p>We will ensure that any direct marketing from us and which is sent by electronic means will provide a simple means for you to stop further communications, in accordance with applicable law. Once you have provided your express consent for us to contact you on our behalf, or on behalf of other organisations, there are a number of methods available to you in order to change your preferences, to correct or update your personal information at any time by:</p>
<ul>
<li>clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ link in any promotional e-mail you receive from us</li>
<li>contacting our product or service team where a correction is required</li>
<li>contacting us at&nbsp; <a href="mailto:marketing@rsc.org">marketing@rsc.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if we need your consent for direct marketing communications under applicable law, and if you provide your consent, you will be able to change your mind at any time.</p>
<p>We use 3rd parties to conduct some of our email campaigns using their contact lists, such as for scientific research, scholarly publishing and scientific education and for reasons such as promoting our journal products to drive manuscript submissions and promotion of our education resources, etc. We will provide such 3rd parties with a stop list of those who have specifically opted out of receiving such emails on the proviso that this list is deleted after the campaign is completed.</p>
<p>In the instance that marketing material we send you is returned, we will remove your incorrect details from our systems, where possible.</p>
<p>If you complete a contact form on one of our websites, your query and information will be forwarded to our relevant internal team to answer and respond.</p>
<h2>Publishing</h2>
<h3>Databases</h3>
<p>The National Chemical Database Service (NCDS) is a portal to allow access to third-party databases. We have contracts with&nbsp;Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)&nbsp;to host the service and with third-party providers to license the databases. We do not send your personal information to EPSRC or the third-party providers.</p>
<p>Your personal data is only used for operational purposes (such as sending service messages or resetting forgotten passwords) unless you have opted in to receive marketing messages.</p>
<p>It is necessary for us to gather evidence of the scientific impact of the NCDS to secure continued funding. Therefore we may occasionally contact registered NCDS users about their use of the service.</p>
<h3>Journals</h3>
<p>Authors submit their manuscript and personal details via online submission and peer review systems.</p>
<p>If a manuscript is accepted the files will be transferred to our Production system, including your personal information.</p>
<p>We may use your personal information to contact you to invite you to serve as a peer reviewer. We will refrain from doing this if you inform us that you do not want to take part in such activity.</p>
<p>Your personal information may be included in our internal tracking and archiving processes.</p>
<p>If you provide us with your personal data, we will ask you if you would like to receive information from us about our other activities, products and services. If you choose to opt-in to receiving this information then we may contact you regarding journal news, journal symposia, Themed Issues, nominations for lectureships and awards. You will not be automatically opted-in and if you do opt-in you can opt-out at any time.</p>
<h2>Profiling and automated decision making</h2>
<p>RSC does itself carry out automated decision making or profiling. We will share email addresses, which have been given directly to RSC by data subjects, or browsing information, &nbsp;&nbsp;obtained in ways such as pixel tracking, to enable us to show tailored adverts on a third party platform, such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Google, whom may perform profiling.</p>
<h2>Film and video</h2>
<p>We have a procedure in place in relation to our use of images through use of photographs and video, including process for consent to use (as applicable), retention and deletion. For more information please contact our Data Protection Officer at the address shown above.</p>
<h3>CCTV at Thomas Graham House or Burlington House</h3>
<p>RSC operates use of CCTV surveillance cameras at these offices. Surveillance is monitored through a live feed by RSC staff within our Facilities Management and Hospitality teams. Off-site/remote access to surveillance footage is only granted to our staff and is provided securely through our IT system, subject to our off-site working practices and policies. Surveillance cameras are located in public access areas such as meeting rooms, post rooms, corridors, cafes, canteens, libraries, stairs, lifts, reception areas and fire exits. Surveillance cameras on these sites record images only; there is no recording of sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our staff will have 24 hour access to the surveillance feeds and may access them during out of office hours in the case of an emergency, incident or alarm activation at our sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surveillance footage is stored securely for a period of 60 (sixty) days in our UK based servers, after which time the surveillance footage is automatically deleted.</p>
<p>In the event of an incident or accident at either site, the footage may be downloaded by our staff and stored securely on our UK based servers in the interests of preserving evidence for any potential investigation and/or claim(s). Any such downloaded footage may also be shared with the relevant authorities, including the Police, where we are required to do so by law. We may retain footage that is downloaded and/or stored for these purposes for a period up to 6 (six) years to take into account the statutory limitation periods for any potential investigation(s) and claim(s). Once any potential investigation(s) or claim(s) has concluded, we will delete the relevant footage.</p>
<p>Access to the surveillance footage is limited to our staff and those third party contractors that are required to perform maintenance and servicing of the surveillance camera equipment, including ADT Fire and Security PLC (“ADT”). ADT are our chosen third party contractors for this service at both sites, however, alternative third party contractors in the same industry may be used by us to maintain and service our surveillance camera equipment in the event of an emergency or a change in our requirements. ADT, or any such third party contractor, will not have access to the surveillance footage off-site/remotely.</p>

<h2>International transfer</h2>
<p>The Royal Society of Chemistry is a global organisation with subsidiary companies located around the world. This Notice establishes our global principles for the collection, use and disclosure of information gathered through our websites and applications. The country in which you are doing business with us or where the website you are visiting is located/hosted may have specific requirements concerning personal information.</p>
<p>The data that we collect from you may be stored in a location outside of the European Economic Area. Where we transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, we ensure it is protected by making sure at least one of the following safeguards is in place:</p>
<ul>
<li>by transferring your personal information to a country that has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the European Commission;</li>
<li>by using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give your personal information the same protection it has within the EEA; or</li>
<li>we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have not set out the specific circumstances when each of these protection measures are used. You can contact us at&nbsp; <a href="mailto:DPO@rsc.org">DPO@rsc.org</a> for the details as to how we protect specific transfer of your data.</p>
<h2>Children’s data</h2>
<p>We recognise any individual under the age of 18 years old as being a child. We take safeguarding of children (including the protection of their personal data) seriously and will take all reasonable steps to ensure that children are provided with sufficiently clear information on how we will collect, process and store their personal data, and that children&nbsp;and their guardians understand the nature of the processing of their personal data together with their rights in respect of the same.</p>
<p>Children below the age of 13 years old will always require the consent of an adult with parental responsibility to provide personal data to, and consent to the processing of that data with us.</p>
<p>Save for photography and filming, children between the ages of 13 years old and 18 years old may be able to provide consent in their own right to the processing of their personal data depending on their maturity and ability to understand the nature of the processing of that data. We will take reasonable steps to assess a child’s maturity and ability to understand the nature of data processing before determining whether a child can reasonably consent to processing in their own right. Further information on how we will assess a child’s ability to consent in their own right can be supplied on request via our contact details above.</p>
<h2>Special categories of personal data</h2>
<p>We may collect special categories of personal data if it is provided to us by you, or on your behalf with your consent and it is appropriate to the service that we will provide to you. By giving us this information, you agree that we may use such information as set out in this Notice.</p>
<p>Examples of sensitive information that we may collect are: gender and marital status.</p>
<h2>Data anonymisation and aggregation</h2>
<p>We may anonymise or aggregate your personal information in such a way as to ensure that you are not identified or identifiable from it, in order to use the anonymised or aggregated data, for example, for statistical analysis and administration including analysis of trends, to carry out actuarial work, to tailor products and services and to conduct risk assessment and analysis of costs and charges in relation to our products and services. We may share anonymised or aggregated data with third parties.</p>
<h2>Your rights</h2>
<p>We also offer the following controls:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>You may request access to, or copies of, the personal information that we hold about you. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us at DPO@rsc.org or the RSC designated address above;</li>
<li>If you believe that any data we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, or have concerns as to how we are using your data please contact us at DPO@rsc.org as soon as possible. We will take steps to seek to correct or update any data if we are satisfied that the data we hold is inaccurate.</li>
<li>You may request that your personal data is deleted, where it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it is being processed and provided there is no other lawful basis for which we may continue to process such information;</li>
<li>If we are processing your personal information to meet our legitimate interests, you may object to the processing of your personal information by us. If we are unable to demonstrate our legitimate grounds for that processing, we will no longer process your personal information for those purposes;</li>
<li>You may withdraw any consent given to processing (this will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal); or</li>
<li>If we are processing your personal information automatically, for the purposes of performing our contract with you, or based on your consent you may have the right to request that the personal information we hold about you be transferred to a third party data controller.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you consider that we are in breach of our obligations under data protection laws, you may lodge a complaint with the&nbsp; <a href="https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/">Information Commissioner’s Office</a>. You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or of an alleged infringement of the GDPR.</p>
<h2>Retention</h2>
<p>We have criteria in place in relation to how we determine the period for which we use your personal information, as well as a process for deletion of your personal information at the end of the relevant retention period. For more information please contact our Data Protection Officer at the address shown above. In certain circumstances, we may be required to retain your personal information for longer where such retention is required by law or record-keeping requirements, including managing our relationship with you, defending any claims, or for tax purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Changes to this Notice</h2>
<p>This statement is not a contract, and it does not create any legal rights or obligations. We may change this Notice from time to time in order to reflect changes in the law and/or our privacy practices. We will update the date at the top of the Notice accordingly. We encourage you to regularly check this Notice online for changes.</p></div>
