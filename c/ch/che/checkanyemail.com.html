<p><b>What information do we collect</b></p>

<p><i>Standard login</i><br>To be able to use CheckAnyEmail.com we require certain information from you, namely your email address and password.

The indentifiable information is encrypted and we promise never to sell or share this information.  Additionally we do not personally make ANY use of this information.</p>
<p><i>Advanced login</i><br>In addition to the information we collect in the standard login we also request your mail server, port number and server protocol.  This additional information is only used for the duration of your logged in session and is forgotten as soon as you logout.</p>

<p><i>Calendar and Addressbook</i><br>
If you decide to make use of the calendar and/or addressbook functions, any information you enter using these functions will be stored in our database for use by yourselves and only by yourselves.  Please note that if you don't login for a period of 120 days your information will automatically be removed from our database.

Please note that if you don't login for a period of 120 days your information will automatically be removed from our database.  Alternatively you can contact us below and request that we remove it before then.</p>

<p><b>Access log information</b></p>
<p>As part of standard server logging, we record your IP (Internet Protocol) address, time and date of access, the user-agent and http protocol elements.  In addition we may log where you came from, this is normal practise for any web server.</p>

<p><b>Cookies</b></p>

<p><b>Secure and encrypted</b></p>
<p>If you are concerned about privacy, you can optionally use our secure login, available from the front page.  Please note that this means that the interaction between your web browser and our server is SSL encrypted, however the connection to retrieve your email is over a standard POP3 or IMAP4 protocol connection (similar to the type of connection made by your PC email client)</p>

<p>To help prevent CheckAnyEmail.com being used to send spam we use the following practices:</p>

<ul><li>Send the client IP address and mail server details in the header of all out going emails</li>
<li>Prevent spoofing of the domain name for the 'from' address</li>
<li>Limit the number of recipients for each email</li>
<li>60 second delay between sending each email</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>
