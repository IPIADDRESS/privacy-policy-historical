Like most website and mobile application operators, CheckPeople automatically gathers information that web browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) Internet domain names; (iii) types of devices accessing the Service; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Service (collectively "<span>Traffic Data</span>"). Traffic Data is anonymous information that is not meant to personally identify you.</p>
                                        <p><span><u>Cookie Policy</u></span>. "<span>Cookies</span>" are text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit or certain emails that you open. Cookies store a string of information on a user's computer or mobile device, which the user's web browser provides to the Service automatically each time it interacts with the Service. The purpose of Cookies is to identify the user as a unique user of the Service. CheckPeople uses two types of Cookies: "first-party cookies" and "third-party cookies."</p>
                                        <p><span><u>First Party Cookies</u></span>. CheckPeople uses first-party Cookies on the Service, for example the Google Analytics Cookie, for the following purposes: (1) to gather visitor and access information relevant to customizing the Service to your interests; and (2) to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Service.</p>

                                        <p><span><u>Advertising on Third Party Websites</u></span>. CheckPeople may advertise on other Third Party Websites to you after you access the Service. We and third-party marketing partners, including without limitation Google, Inc. ("<span>Google</span>"), may use first party Cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie), third party Cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie), and web beacons (such as the Facebook conversion tracking pixel, see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/a/online-sales/conversion-tracking">https://www.facebook.com/business/a/online-sales/conversion-tracking</a>), including across multiple devices, to inform, optimize, and serve advertisements to you based on your use of the Service. This practice is commonly known as retargeting or remarketing (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_retargeting">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_retargeting)</a>.</p>
                                        <p><span><u>Google Analytics</u></span>. Google Analytics is Google's analytics tool that helps website and app owners to understand how their visitors engage with their properties. It may use a set of cookies to collect information and report website usage statistics without personally identifying individual visitors to Google. The main cookie used by Google Analytics is the "__ga" cookie. CheckPeople uses Google Analytics on the CheckPeople.com website.</p>
                                        <p><span><u>Data Collection by Third Parties</u></span>. Any of these third parties may place Cookies on your computer or mobile device, use web beacons (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacon">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacon</a>), and gather IP addresses and log data to collect traffic and activity data to deliver relevant metrics and content.</p>

                                        <p><span><u>Personally Identifiable Information</u></span>. To use certain features of the Service, you will be asked to provide CheckPeople certain personally identifiable information ("<span>Personal Information</span>"). Personal Information includes the following categories, without limitation: (1) "<span>Contact Data</span>" (such as your name, phone number, fax number, mailing address and email address); (2) "<span>Financial Data</span>" (such as your credit/debit card number and expiration date); (3) "<span>Demographic Data</span>" (such as your gender and ZIP code); and (4) "<span>Third Party Social Media Account Data</span>" (such as your account information for third party social media accounts when you access the Service in connection to those accounts). In each case, you will be asked to provide Personal Information; the Service will not gather it secretly. CheckPeople may supplement the Personal Information you provide with additional Personal Information gathered from public sources or from third parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies) who may lawfully provide that information to CheckPeople. You are under no obligation to provide Personal Information, with the caveat that your refusal to do so may prevent you from using certain features of the Service.</p>
